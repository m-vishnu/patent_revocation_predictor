IV. In the opposition proceedings, the respondent (patent proprietor) defended the patent in a restricted version. In its decision, the opposition division concluded that the present main request meets the requirements of the EPC. In particular, the claimed method is sufficiently disclosed (Article 83 EPC) and is novel and inventive over D1 (Articles 54/56 EPC).

V. The independent claim 1 of the maintained version, on which the contested decision is based, reads as follows:

""Method for producing adiponitrile by hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene over a catalyst, wherein

in a first process step, 1,3-butadiene is hydrocyanated to 3-pentenenitrile over at least one nickel(0) catalyst and

IX. An oral hearing took place on January 16, 2020. At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

Main Request

2. Sufficiency of Disclosure (Article 83 EPC)

2.1 Missing Example

2.1.1 The appellant criticizes that no example falls under the claims, as the only example of the patent no longer includes the claimed steps (b), (c), and (e) after the restrictions made.

2.1.2 The respondent argues that the sequence of the claimed process steps is clear to the skilled person and that there is also a flow diagram according to the invention in Figure 2. The example of the patent differs from the claim only in that unreacted butadiene is separated from the hydrocyanation stream before isomerization and returned to the reactor after step (a).

2.1.3 According to Rule 42(1)(e) EPC, at least one way to carry out the claimed invention must be specified in detail. This has been done in the present case, for example, in Figure 2. The EPC does not mandatorily require examples. The mere absence of an example does not justify a lack of sufficiency of disclosure, as long as the skilled person is able to carry out the claimed process. The process steps themselves are known to the skilled person. No arguments have been presented as to why the skilled person should not be able to perform the process steps in the claimed order. Therefore, this objection by the appellant is not convincing.

2.2 ""Nickel(0) Catalyst""

2.2.1 The appellant has criticized the feature ""Nickel(0) catalyst"" in the claims. In their view, a literal interpretation of this feature renders process step (c) unfeasible, as nickel is already present in oxidation state 0 there.

The opposition division concluded in its decision that the skilled person would interpret this term to mean that both Nickel(0) alone and in a mixture with the deactivated catalyst formed during the reaction in oxidized state are intended.

The Board agrees with the opposition division on this point. A skilled person knows that when catalyst regeneration is mentioned, the consumed portion of the catalyst is regenerated, even if it is present in a mixture with still active catalyst.

2.2.2 The appellant also criticized that process step (c) requires regeneration of the catalyst through reductive catalyst synthesis. They argue that regeneration and synthesis are two different things, so the skilled person would not know whether they are working within or outside of claim 1.

In the Board's view, this is, if at all, a question of clarity under Article 84 EPC, which is not at issue here. Furthermore, paragraphs [0074] to [0078] of the description explain how this process can be carried out.

2.3 Overall, the Board concludes that the claimed process is described in an executable manner for the skilled person in the description.

3. Inventive Step

3.1 Closest Prior Art

Both parties consider D1 as the closest prior art, and the Board agrees. There, a process for the production of adiponitrile by double hydrocyanation of butadiene is described, particularly in Figure 10.1. This figure is presented with annotations for better comparison with the claimed process as D10 in the proceedings.

3.2 The Claimed Process

The claimed process is a two-stage catalytic hydrocyanation process of 1,3-butadiene to adiponitrile with an intervening isomerization of pentenenitriles and catalyst regeneration, during which the process streams are subjected to various separation stages. In the present case, the Board finds it appropriate to first clarify the significance of some technical features of the claimed process.

3.2.1 After the first hydrocyanation in step (a), the entire hydrocyanation output is transferred to the isomerization, step (a').

This follows from the wording of the claim (""Subjecting the hydrocyanation stream 1 to an isomerization step (...)""). Any intervening additional process steps would alter the composition of the stream, so that no longer the ""hydrocyanation stream 1"" would be subjected to isomerization.

3.2.2 From the isomerization output (""isomerization stream 1""), the catalyst is then separated in step (b) and regenerated in step (c) (""catalyst stream 2""). This regenerated catalyst stream 2, which contains nickel-(0) catalyst and Lewis acid, constitutes at least a part of the catalyst used in the second hydrocyanation step (d).

3.2.3 From the hydrocyanation output of the second hydrocyanation (""hydrocyanation stream 3""), the catalyst is separated in step (e) and at least partially returned in step (a), i.e., to the first hydrocyanation.

This can only be understood to mean that this stream is directly transferred to the first hydrocyanation, and not through the detour of another process step such as regeneration.

Although the appellant has argued that the claim only requires certain process steps and is otherwise open-ended, the Board cannot follow this interpretation of the claim. The claim does not define all details of the process. However, if the claim literally requires that a certain stream is directed into a specific process step, it must be understood that way.

3.3 The Process in D1

The process in D1 is illustrated in Figure 10.1 of D1; a version with annotations from the appellant is available as D10.

In D1, after the first hydrocyanation, the product stream is split, and a large part of the product stream is transferred to the second hydrocyanation after separating the used catalyst, together with still active catalyst as stream 12. A second partial stream goes as stream 11 to the isomerization and is supplemented there with fresh catalyst.

For the second hydrocyanation step, the process of D1 uses an activated catalyst solution, which is mixed in tank T-302 from still active catalyst, regenerated catalyst, and Lewis acid (streams 58 and 68). After the second hydrocyanation, the catalyst is separated as stream 34 from the product stream and subjected to regeneration (""catalyst section""), before it is then partially returned to the first hydrocyanation via stream 67.

3.4 Objective

The Board sees the technical problem to be solved by the claimed process as finding an alternative method for producing adiponitrile from 1,3-butadiene.

While the respondent has argued that the process is less apparatus-intensive compared to D1, as only one catalyst loop is needed and the catalyst must be regenerated at fewer points in the process, making it therefore more economical.

In contrast, the appellant has argued that there is no evidence for such a claim. On the other hand, various partial steps of the claimed process are less economical than the process of D1. For example, the entire hydrocyanation output is transferred to the isomerization here, which, due to the prevailing equilibrium between the desired but already present product in excess and the undesired isomerizable by-product, reduces the efficiency of the isomerization compared to D1.

The appellant is correct in that there is no evidence that the claimed process would be overall more economical than that of D1. On the other hand, no obvious deterioration of the overall process is recognizable. In the Board's opinion, the processes of D1 and the presently claimed process are optimized in different ways. The problem to be solved is therefore formulated as an alternative.

3.5 Solution

3.5.1 The problem is solved by the claimed process, which is characterized at least by the following features:

(i) The entire hydrocyanation output, i.e., product and catalyst, is transferred to the isomerization (steps (a) and (a'))

(ii) The second hydrocyanation is carried out with a catalyst stream that contains catalyst and Lewis acid and which at least partially originates from the catalyst regeneration (step (d))

(iii) The catalyst separated from the output of the second hydrocyanation is at least partially returned to the first hydrocyanation (step (e))

Features (i) and (ii) were undisputed.

The appellant has argued that feature (iii) is also realized in D1, as the catalyst stream 34 is also partially directed via stream 67 to the first hydrocyanation after undergoing the regeneration process (""catalyst section""). However, the Board cannot agree with this. In D1, the catalyst stream 34 is not directed to the first hydrocyanation, but is first directed to regeneration. Such a procedure is not covered by the claim, as explained above.

3.5.2 That the claimed process solves the problem, i.e., that it is suitable for the production of adiponitrile from 1,3-butadiene, was ultimately no longer disputed by the appellant. The Board also sees no reason why this should not be the case.

3.6 Obviousness of the Solution

3.6.1 In the contested decision, inventive step was essentially justified by the fact that the skilled person would not receive any indication from D1 to transfer the entire hydrocyanation output to the isomerization (feature (i) above). It could not be inferred from D1 that the catalyst after the first hydrocyanation is still active enough to also catalyze the isomerization. In D1, the catalyst is separated after hydrocyanation and fresh catalyst is used for the isomerization (stream 13).

3.6.2 The appellant has argued, however, that from a comparison of streams 6 and 13 in D1, the skilled person would deduce that the hydrocyanation output (stream 6) still contains catalyst in an amount sufficient for carrying out the isomerization. A skilled person would therefore have known that the entire hydrocyanation output could be transferred to the isomerization.

The Board cannot agree with this. D1 uses two different loops for the catalysts in the hydrocyanation steps and in the isomerization step. In the isomerization step, the catalyst is fed in stream 13 and returned via stream 19; oxidized catalyst is separated via stream 15 and subjected to drying and subsequent regeneration. In contrast, the catalyst from the first hydrocyanation step is transferred via stream 12 to the second hydrocyanation step and activated there with additional catalyst and Lewis acid. The respondent correctly pointed out that transferring the entire hydrocyanation stream including the catalyst to the isomerization in D1 would also require a restructuring of the catalyst loops. However, there is no indication of this in D1.

3.6.3 The differences (ii) and (iii) also do not emerge in an obvious manner from D1.

These features result from the fact that in the presently claimed process, the catalyst from the first hydrocyanation is regenerated in the isomerization before the second hydrocyanation, forming the Lewis acid, and is thus used in the second hydrocyanation. Thereafter, it is at least partially directly (i.e., without intermediate regeneration) returned to the first hydrocyanation. This procedure fundamentally differs from the process of D1, which provides for two separate catalyst loops and subjects the oxidized part of the catalyst to regeneration after each step. A transfer of the catalyst from the second to the first hydrocyanation without prior regeneration (feature (iii)) is not provided for in D1. A skilled person receives no indication from D1 regarding the claimed procedure.

3.7 Overall, the Board concludes that the claimed process represents a non-obvious alternative for the production of adiponitrile by hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene starting from D1.

3.8 Therefore, there is no need to further address the auxiliary requests.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,INVISTA Technologies S.à.r.l.,INVISTA Technologies S.à.r.l.

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Inventive Step

The only disputed point in the proceedings is the question of inventive step under Article 56 EPC.

2.1 Closest Prior Art

2.1.1 The present independent claim relates to a process for the preparation of 3-pentenenitrile by hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene. In the claimed process, the reaction output undergoes a series of distillations, with unreacted butadiene being returned to the reactor and the catalyst being separated.

2.1.2 D1 discloses a process for separating alkenes, such as butenes, from alkadienes, such as butadiene, which can only be separated economically with difficulty (see column 1, lines 58-61). It exploits the fact that butadiene can be hydrocyanated more easily than butenes; the resulting nitriles can then be more easily separated from the unreactive alkene.

Thus, the separation process of D1 utilizes a hydrocyanation of a mixture of butadiene and butenes. The process is illustrated in Figure 1 of D1 and described in columns 2 and 3 of D1.

2.1.3 D5 discloses a process for the production of adiponitrile by double sequential hydrocyanation of butadiene. As a product of the first step, a mixture of 3-pentenenitrile and catalyst is obtained. The process is illustrated in Fig. 10.1 (page 571).

2.1.4 The opposition division considered D5 to be the closest prior art, as it believed that this document primarily addresses the production of 3-pentenenitrile, while D1 primarily concerns the separation of monoolefins and diolefins (page 5, first paragraph of the contested decision).

2.1.5 The appellant, on the other hand, considered D1 to be the closest prior art. D1 discloses the production of 3-pentenenitrile by hydrocyanation of butadiene with the catalyst being returned. Although this process is described in the context of separating alkene/alkadiene mixtures, it is known as a classic hydrocyanation process (column 1, lines 19 ff.). A skilled person would therefore see in D1 the disclosure of a hydrocyanation process for the production of 3-pentenenitrile. In particular, they would recognize that such a process is present when the input stream 5 in D5 consists solely of butadiene.

The respondent agreed with the view of the opposition division and considered D5 to be the closest prior art.

2.1.6 The board considers D5 to be the closest prior art. The reasoning of the opposition division that D1 is more concerned with a process for separating alkenes from alkadienes is not to be dismissed. This is already evident from the first paragraph of D1, as well as from the wording of the claims of D1, which relate to a process for separating a mixture of alkenes and alkadienes. The desired product in D1 is the alkene in stream 8, which is depleted of butadiene. The product stream 12 containing 3-pentenenitrile is mentioned in column 3, lines 22/23 (""where the crude mononitrile is recovered overhead and directed to purification (line 12)""), but it is not clear how this purification is to be carried out. It is also not clear which of the isomeric nitriles actually represents a desired product. The purpose of D1 is therefore indeed the separation of alkenes and alkadienes and not primarily the production of 3-pentenenitrile. In contrast, in D5, 3-pentenenitrile is a desired (intermediate) product.

2.2 Differences

2.2.1 It was undisputed that the process steps (a) and (b) are disclosed in D5. Stream 3 of the presently claimed process corresponds to stream 10 from D5, which is drawn off from the sump in evaporator E-105.

2.2.2 It was also undisputed that steps (c) and (d) are not disclosed in D5.

In D5, in column C-101, the catalyst is discharged together with 3-pentenenitrile in the sump, and this product mixture is not further separated, as it is used in this form in the next reaction stage. 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile is obtained overhead in this column.

In contrast, step (c) requires a side draw column in which the catalyst is separated in the sump, and in which a mixture of 3-pentenenitrile and 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile is obtained in the side draw and butadiene overhead. The butadiene is returned in step (a) or (b). Step (d) then requires a distillation of the nitrile stream.

2.3 Objective and Solution

2.3.1 According to the respondent, the claimed process solves various objectives mentioned in paragraphs [0010] to [0012] of the description:

a) Increasing the process yield based on butadiene

b) Enabling the return of the catalyst to the reaction

c) Lower thermal load on the catalyst, and

d) A lower proportion of 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile is returned to the reactor.

Regarding objective (a), it was pointed out that in Example 1 (Figure 2), due to the double return of butadiene in steps (b) and (c), only 0.31% of the butadiene used is discharged via stream 4b, which was also calculated by the appellant in D15.

Objective (b) is obviously solved by step (c) of the process.

The solution to objective (c) arises from the fact that the catalyst is separated in step (c) and is therefore no longer present during the separation of the nitriles, which requires longer residence times.

Regarding objective (d), it was pointed out that by separating the nitriles in a separate step, sharper separation conditions could be applied, as the thermolabile catalyst is no longer present.

2.3.2 According to the appellant, the claimed process only solves the objective of providing an alternative.

The advantages claimed by the respondent are not substantiated. No numerical comparison has been made regarding the process yield (a) and the return of 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile (d) with the process of D5. Shorter residence times of the catalyst and a resulting lower load (c) are also not substantiated. Objective (b) is simply a decision regarding the manner of conducting the catalyst stream and is not associated with substantiated advantages.

2.3.3 As will be elaborated below, the board concludes that the finding of the claimed process as an alternative to the process known from D5 was not obvious to the skilled person. Whether the process has the advantages claimed by the respondent or not can therefore remain open.

The board thus adopts the definition of the technical problem as proposed by the appellant.

Starting from D5, the objective to be solved by the claimed process was to find an alternative process for the production of 3-pentenenitrile.

2.3.4 That this problem was solved by means of the claimed process was undisputed.

2.4 Obviousness of the Solution

It remains to be decided whether the claimed solution was suggested to the skilled person by the prior art.

2.4.1 The appellant was of the opinion that the claimed process arises in an obvious manner from a combination of D5 and D1, taking D4 into account, as follows:

The starting point for the skilled person's considerations would be stream 10 in D5. The crucial question would be whether the skilled person, as in D5, would remove the catalyst from the product or, alternatively, would recycle it back into the reactor. From the process description on page 203 of D5, it becomes clear that the catalyst is a valuable product. Therefore, a return of the catalyst is suggested to the skilled person, especially since this is exactly what is done in the process of D1 (streams 13 or 17/18). Although D1 deals with the separation of alkenes and alkadienes, the hydrocyanation process used for this is described in this document as a standard process (column 1, line 19 ff. of D1). The other changes to be made would necessarily follow from the decision to return the catalyst. The side draw column K2 in step (c) corresponds to a combination of columns 3 and 4 of D1; such a combination is general knowledge, as illustrated by D4. The return of the butadiene stream 4 corresponds to stream 9 in D1. The distillative separation of the nitrile mixture in the claimed step (d) is also pre-described in D1 (column 3, lines 22/23).

In summary, the skilled person would only need to decide to return the catalyst in the process of D5; the remaining changes would then follow in an obvious manner.

2.4.2 The respondent essentially argued that the teaching of D5 is precisely to not separate the catalyst from the product, as it is still used in the further course of the process. Therefore, a skilled person would not separate the catalyst in search of an alternative, as this would contradict the teaching of D5. D1 pertains to a different technical field and would therefore not be considered by the skilled person, even if they were looking at other documents. Furthermore, even applying the process of D1 to stream 10 would not lead to the claimed process. For example, the return stream 4 is missing, and there is no side draw column present.

2.4.3 The board essentially follows the arguments of the respondent.

A skilled person would find no indication in D5 that returning the catalyst would also be a viable alternative when searching for an alternative production process for 3-pentenenitrile. D5 explicitly states that the catalyst is to be introduced with the 3-pentenenitrile into the second hydrocyanation stage and therefore does not need to be separated, see the process description on page 203 above. Even if the skilled person were to decide on a return of the catalyst, there would be several possibilities for doing so; for instance, the catalyst could also be separated downstream from stream 12 from the product.

A combination with D1 would not be considered by the skilled person. D1 primarily deals with a process for separating alkenes from alkadienes, as already stated above (see point 2.1). A skilled person would first have to reinterpret the teaching of D1 into a production process for 3-pentenenitrile and then incorporate individual process steps into the process of D5. However, there is no reason for this; in D1, 3-pentenenitrile is not particularly highlighted as a product.

Even if the skilled person were to do this, they would not obtain the claimed process from this combination. In D1, butadiene is not returned, as claimed here, but is discharged from the process via streams 9 and 8. The argument that stream 9 in D1 corresponds to the present stream 4 is not convincing, as the butadiene returned in stream 4 remains in the process, while in D1 the butadiene is ultimately discharged unreacted. D1 also does not disclose a side draw column corresponding to K2, nor the final distillation step. Although the appellant referred to D4 regarding an equivalence of columns 3/4 with the side draw column K2, the respondent rightly pointed out that columns 3 and 4 in D1 operate at different pressures (0.1 MPa/0.015 MPa), which does not support a merging.

In summary, it can be stated that the skilled person, starting from D5 in search of an alternative process, would have had no indication to change the manner of catalyst handling. They would not have considered a combination with D1 either, as the process there does not aim at the production of 3-pentenenitrile. Finally, even if they had combined the two processes, they would only have obtained the claimed process if they had made additional modifications that were neither proposed in D5 nor in D1 nor elsewhere. They could only have done this in hindsight, i.e., not without knowledge of the claimed invention.

3. In conclusion, it can therefore be stated that the independent claim of the main request, and thus all claims of the main request, meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC. The submitted auxiliary requests can therefore be disregarded.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,INVISTA Technologies S.à.r.l.,INVISTA Technologies S.à.r.l.

I. The appeal of the appellant (patent holder) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to revoke the patent EP 2 168 942 under Article 101(2) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged under Articles 100(a) and 100(b) EPC for lack of novelty, lack of inventive step, and lack of sufficiency of disclosure.

In this context, reference was made to the following documents:

D8a:    EP 1 272 268 B1

D9:     EP 0 708 076 B1

D13:    EP 1 291 078 A2

D17:    US 5,313,009

III. In its decision, the opposition division found the requirements of sufficiency of disclosure (Article 83 EPC) and novelty (Article 54 EPC) to be fulfilled. However, it concluded that the claimed method was suggested by D8a (Article 56 EPC) and revoked the patent.

IV. The independent claim of the patent, which is also the basis for the present decision, reads as follows:

""Method for the continuous production of nitrobenzene by nitration of benzene with mixed acid in a reaction space, wherein benzene and the mixed acid are repeatedly dispersed into one another, characterized in that

a) the mixed acid used contains at least 3.0 wt.% nitric acid and at least 67.0 wt.% sulfuric acid, each based on the weight of the mixed acid, and

b) the starting temperature of the reaction is above 100.0°C but below 102.0°C, and

c) the emulsion obtained after the first dispersion of mixed acid and benzene is redispered at least 4 times before the conversion of nitric acid reaches 60%, and

d) within the first 13 vol.% of the reaction space after the first dispersion, at least 60% of the nitric acid used has been converted.""

V. In her statement of grounds of appeal and in further proceedings, the appellant essentially argued that the method was not suggested by D8a. The claimed combination of features, particularly the choice of the starting temperature of the method, achieves an unexpected improvement in reaction yield. Novelty and sufficiency of disclosure were rightly affirmed by the opposition division.

VI. In her response to the statement of grounds of appeal and in further proceedings, the respondent essentially argued that inventive step was rightly denied by the opposition division. An improvement of the method caused by distinguishing features was not substantiated, and even if it were, it would be a bonus of a method suggested by D8a, possibly in combination with further documents. Furthermore, the claimed method was not even novel over D8a and did not disclose the necessary information for its execution to the skilled person.

VII. Requests

The appellant (patent holder) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the rejection of the opposition, alternatively the maintenance of the patent based on the auxiliary request 1 submitted by letter dated December 16, 2015.

The respondent (opponent) requested the rejection of the appeal.

VIII. An oral hearing took place on February 18, 2020. At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

Main Request

2. Sufficiency of Disclosure (Article 83 EPC)

2.1 According to the opponent, the claimed method is not sufficiently disclosed. Specifically, it criticizes the following points:

a) Features c) and d) of the method, i.e., the number of redisperisons of the reaction mixture before reaching 60% conversion of nitric acid or the conversion of at least 60% of nitric acid within the first 13% of the reaction space, are desiderata for which the patent does not disclose a concretely executable teaching.

b) The required space-time yield also only defines the result to be achieved.

c) The various percentage indications in the claims are unclear (weight percent, volume percent, percent of the reaction space, etc.), which according to the case law of the boards also leads to a lack of sufficiency of disclosure; T 464/05 and T 593/09 are cited in this regard.

d) The patent does not specify how and where the claimed starting temperature is to be determined. Reference was made to T 923/13.

e) The examples are contradictory regarding the results achieved.

2.2 The opposition division did not find the opponent's arguments convincing (Point 2 of the Reasons for the Decision).

The board agrees with the opinion of the opposition division. There are no reasons that would prevent a skilled person from carrying out the claimed method for the nitration of benzene. Regarding the individual arguments presented:

a) As stated by the appellant, the patent contains instructions in paragraphs [0030] to [0032] on how to implement the method apparatus-wise to achieve the specified process parameters. Usable apparatuses are listed there. Even if no detailed reactor is described in the examples, the number of dispersion elements and their arrangement are specified.

b) A specific space-time yield is not defined in the claims and therefore does not need to be achieved to comply with Article 83 EPC. Furthermore, the examples show how such a yield can be achieved.

c) Percentage indications of weight, volume, reactor volume, conversion, etc., are common terms whose meanings are known to the skilled person. Moreover, any potential ambiguity in defining the scope of the claims does not automatically lead to a lack of disclosure of the invention, as clarified by the decision T 593/09 cited by the opponent. Regarding the cited decision T 464/05, it is noted that according to more recent case law (e.g., T 1811/13), ambiguity in the boundaries of the claim cannot be regarded as a problem of lack of sufficiency of disclosure.

d) The term ""starting temperature"" is explained to the skilled person, see paragraph [0010] of the description. The location of the temperature measurement is specified there, namely immediately after the dosing of benzene into the mixed acid before the first dispersion. Methods for measuring temperature are also familiar to the skilled person. It was claimed that this temperature could not be determined with the required accuracy, but no evidence was submitted for this. The cited decision T 923/13 dealt with the question of whether a normally accessible parameter of a polymer in a specific end product can still be determined. However, this question is not relevant in the present case.

e) Any contradictions in the results of the examples (yields, etc.) are irrelevant to the question of the sufficiency of disclosure of the method. The nitration itself can indeed be carried out in the claimed manner.

3. Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

3.1 In the contested decision, the opposition division concluded that the claimed method is novel over D8a (Point 3 of the Reasons for the Decision). In particular, the feature (b) of the claim, i.e., the starting temperature of the method, is not disclosed in D8a.

The board agrees with this view, also considering the arguments presented by the opponent during the appeal proceedings. The reasons for this are explained below.

3.2 The example in D8a discloses the claimed features (c) and (d), but not (a) and (b). This was undisputed. The concentration of sulfuric acid is below the claimed range. Furthermore, the starting temperature is not explicitly stated; however, the acids to be mixed are presented at 95°C and 60°C, so the starting temperature is likely to be significantly below 100°C. This was confirmed by the parties during the oral proceedings; a temperature of just over 90°C was assumed.

3.3 The question is now whether, as stated by the opponent, a combination of the example with features from the general part of the description is possible to arrive at a novelty-destroying disclosure.

3.3.1 The opponent argued that the temperature indication ""preferably 60-100°C"" in paragraph [0040] of D8a overlaps with the claimed range. The same paragraph also mentions the prior mixing of the reaction participants. There is also no selection of the temperature range because no distance is maintained from the disclosed point of 100°C. The claimed concentrations of the acids used are described in paragraph [0039].

In the sense of a ""whole content approach,"" the claimed method is therefore pre-described in D8a. Reference was made to corresponding case law of the boards (Case Law, 9th edition 2019, I.C.4.1. ""General Interpretation Rules"").

Furthermore, it is also possible to infer the used starting temperatures from the end temperatures disclosed in D8a in paragraph [0041] (""preferably 120° to 150°C"") and in the example (""135°C"") considering the various concentrations of the acids.

3.3.2 The board does not dispute that a document must be read as a whole and therefore, in individual cases, generally disclosed features may be combined with features from the examples.

However, this is not the decisive question in the present case, as even such a combination does not lead to a direct and unambiguous disclosure that would fall under the claims of the contested patent.

3.3.3 The indications in paragraph [0040] refer to the temperature of the reactants before mixing, not to the defined starting temperature of the reaction here. Furthermore, these indications refer to nitration reactions in general, and not specifically to the mononitration of benzene. A starting temperature in the claimed range would only be achieved if all reactants are heated to 99-100°C. The calculation of the starting temperature from the preferred concentration indications in paragraph [0039] of D8a presented on page 25 of the opponent's submission of June 25, 2015, requires this additional assumption, which is not disclosed in D8a.

Moreover, in the board's opinion, it is not straightforward to combine the parameters for (c) and (d) calculated by the opponent from the example of D8a with the temperature indication in paragraph [0040]. As stated by the appellant, these conversion parameters, particularly parameter (d), depend not only on the reactor geometry and flow rates but also on the starting temperature, which in the example does not correspond to the claimed values. It is therefore not clear whether, with a potential adjustment of the starting temperature in the range of 100°C to 102°C in the example, the conversion parameters would remain within the scope of the claim.

3.3.4 The opponent's reference to case law for selection inventions is also misplaced because this is not a one-dimensional selection of the temperature range from 100°C to 102°C from the indication ""50 to 120°C, preferably 60-100°C"" of D8a. As stated above, there is no specific disclosure of a mononitration of benzene in paragraph [0040]. Furthermore, there is also no specific disclosure corresponding to the point ""100°C starting temperature"" from which a distance would need to be maintained, as all reactants would need to be heated to this temperature, which is not directly described in D8a.

3.3.5 A reverse calculation of the starting temperature from the end temperature, as argued by the opponent, also does not lead to a claimed method. From the general indications in paragraph [0041], no specific starting temperature for a specific reaction can be calculated without making additional, not directly disclosed assumptions, such as regarding the concentrations of the reactants. In the example, as stated above, a starting temperature of just over 90°C must be assumed, making any reverse calculation pointless.

3.4 In summary, it can be concluded that document D8a does not contain a direct and unambiguous disclosure of a claimed method.

In particular, the starting temperature required in feature (b) is not disclosed there in a manner corresponding to the claim.

4. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

The board does not follow the opinion of the opposition division that the claimed method is suggested to the skilled person by the prior art. The reasons for this are explained below.

4.1 Closest Prior Art

The claims relate to a continuous method for producing nitrobenzene by nitrating benzene with mixed acid. The closest prior art is undisputedly D8a.

D8a discloses in the example a method from which the claimed method at hand differs at least by the higher starting temperature.

4.2 Objective

According to paragraph [0023] of the patent, the objective of the invention was to provide a method that ensures satisfactory product quality at a high space-time yield.

Starting from D8a, the technical problem is formulated as providing an improved such method.

4.3 Claimed Solution to the Problem

The claimed method is characterized in particular by operating at a starting temperature of the reaction of 100°-102°C. This achieves a higher conversion while maintaining at least the same product quality.

The formulation of the problem and the claimed solution was undisputed between the parties. However, it was disputed whether this problem was also solved. This will be addressed in more detail below.

4.3.1 In the contested decision, the opposition division concluded that this problem was not solved. No effect caused by the increase in starting temperature was proven.

The opposition division was of the opinion that from the comparison of comparative example 2 with the inventive example 3 in Table 1 of the patent, it could not be concluded that the increase in starting temperature leads to an increase in the conversion of the reaction. Although an increased nitric acid conversion is obtained in the inventive example 3 compared to comparative example 2, it also emerges from this table that this increased conversion in the inventive example 3 is achieved with a smaller temperature increase between starting and end temperature, although the opposite would actually be expected. Since according to paragraph [0040] of the patent, the temperature increase correlates with the conversion of nitric acid, the opposition division considered the comparative data to be not credible due to this inconsistency, and therefore an improvement of the method was not proven.

The opponent agreed with this view.

4.3.2 The board first notes that Table 1 indeed shows that the nitric acid conversion in example 3 is higher than in example 2. The amount of by-products formed remains essentially constant, and the proportion of explosive picric acid among the by-products decreases by one third. Since the starting temperature is the only difference in the procedure, the increase in conversion must be attributed to it.

The board cannot agree with the reasoning in the opposition decision. It is true that the description in the examples in paragraph [0040] states that the temperature increase serves to calculate the conversions. However, paragraph [0040] only refers to the calculation of intermediate conversions; the end conversions were measured according to the appellant's indication and not calculated. The end conversions are tabulated and should therefore initially be taken as is. The board has no reason to doubt the tabulated values. The opponent has not conducted any experiments that could confirm such doubts.

4.3.3 According to the opponent, the comparison made in the patent is inadmissible. Comparative tests must always be conducted with the closest prior art, in this case with the example from D8a. They referred to the case law of the boards, for example, T 197/86. Intrinsic comparative tests are not allowed. A meaningful comparison with the example from D8a was not made. If the examples are compared anyway, it is clear that in the present patent, the amount of by-products formed increases significantly despite the higher temperature.

The board cannot agree with this. It is true that according to the established case law of the boards, comparative tests must be conducted with the prior art in such a way that an effect can be attributed to the distinguishing feature. However, it is also permissible and may even be required to approximate embodiments from the prior art to the invention so that they differ only by the feature that distinguishes the claim (Case Law, 9th edition 2019, I.D.10.9). This is exactly what is stated in the decision T 197/86 cited by the opponent. In the present case, it would not be productive to conduct comparative tests in which a different apparatus is used each time. In such a case, no statement could be made about the effect of the temperature. It is therefore permissible to demonstrate such an effect either with the experimental setup of D8a or with that of the contested patent; both options are equally valid.

4.3.4 Furthermore, the opponent was of the opinion that the measured point effect cannot be generalized to all types of apparatus. An effect is therefore not proven across the entire claim scope. It is at least obvious that compared to the example of D8a, an increase in starting temperature increases the amount of by-products and thus does not bring an improvement.

In the board's view, such a perspective, however, misunderstands the nature of distinguishing features and comparative tests. The comparative test conducted shows that an increase in starting temperature under otherwise identical experimental conditions leads to an increased conversion. It is therefore credible, until proven otherwise, that this feature also leads to such an effect in other apparatuses or with other modified reaction parameters, as long as these are kept constant. Therefore, the distinguishing feature of the claim is supported across its entire breadth by the comparative test. It is not required that any reaction falling under the claim leads to a higher conversion with a constant amount of by-products than any reaction with a lower starting temperature (such as the example from D8a).

To demonstrate that the measured effect does not occur across the entire claim scope, the opponent was free to investigate a reaction that meets the other claim features using the apparatus of D8a or their own experimental setup regarding the effect of the starting temperature. A mere assertion, however, cannot undermine the credibility of the effect measured by the appellant.

4.3.5 The other arguments presented by the opponent also do not convince.

It was argued that the examples of the patent are a kind of black box and not reproducible, as the exact design of the apparatus is not disclosed. However, the examples indicate that it is a tubular reactor with tantalum inserts, such reactors are known (see paragraphs [0031] and [0032]). It is also stated that the same apparatus is used in example 2 and example 3. This argument does not undermine the significance of the comparative tests.

Furthermore, it was argued that an effect of the starting temperature is not proven, as comparative example 1 operates at the same starting temperature as the inventive example 3 but shows lower conversions. However, in comparative example 1, the number of dispersion elements is lower, and therefore feature (c) of the claim is not fulfilled. The appellant does not claim that temperature is the only feature that affects the reaction conversion. This argument also does not undermine the significance of the comparative tests.

4.3.6 The board therefore concludes that the above-defined technical problem has been solved by the claimed method.

4.4 Obviousness of the Solution

It remains to be determined whether it was obvious for the skilled person, starting from D8a, to choose starting temperatures of 100°-102°C to improve the method.

4.4.1 D8a discloses that generally the reactants are heated to a temperature of 50°-120°C, preferably 60°-100°C, before mixing (paragraph [0040]).

According to the opponent, there was no reason for the skilled person not to carry out the reaction precisely in the temperature range selected by the contested patent. Any effect achieved in doing so is irrelevant, as it would automatically occur as a consequence of applying the teaching of D8a. Reference was made to the case law regarding so-called bonus effects (Case Law, 9th edition 2016, I.D.10.8).

The board does not follow this argument. There is no indication in D8a that improved conversions can be achieved with a starting temperature of 100°-102°C. In the example, this temperature is about 90°C. D8a does not describe that the selection of a specific starting temperature is associated with any advantages. The preferred range in paragraph [0040] lies outside the claim and is not even specifically disclosed for the claimed reaction. This is also not a bonus effect. Such a bonus effect would require that the skilled person receives a hint in D8a to work in the claimed range for other reasons. However, no such hint exists. On the contrary, a specific temperature range has been selected that is associated with a beneficial method.

4.4.2 Combination with Documents

The opponent also argued that a combination with documents D9, D13, and D17 leads the skilled person to the claimed method. In particular, D9 discloses a starting temperature of 100° to 130°C and D17 from 100° to 120°C.

However, this cannot convince. As correctly pointed out by the appellant, D9 deals with the dinitration of aromatic compounds, not with mononitrations. D17 highlights as a critical feature that the concentration of sulfuric acid is below 3% (see column 3, lines 5ff), which is not the case here. D13 deals with the design of tubular reactors and does not disclose any starting temperatures for nitration processes at all.

4.5 The claimed method is therefore a non-obvious solution to the technical problem of providing an improved method for the mononitration of benzene starting from D8a.

5. Overall, none of the objections raised prevent the maintenance of the patent (Article 101(2) EPC). Therefore, the submitted auxiliary request does not need to be addressed.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2.

I. The appeals of the two appellants I and II (Opponents I and II) are directed against the decision of the Opposition Division to maintain the patent EP 1 940 347 in amended form under Article 101(3)(a) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the contested patent was challenged in its entirety based on Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty and lack of inventive step, as well as Article 100(b) EPC for lack of sufficiency of disclosure.

IV. In the opposition proceedings, the respondent (patent holder) defended the patent in amended form. The Opposition Division concluded in its decision that the claimed use was sufficiently disclosed to the skilled person (Article 83 EPC), novel over the disclosures of documents D1 to D3, D5, and D10 to D13 (Article 54 EPC), and based on an inventive step starting from D6 (or D7, the content of both documents was considered largely identical) as the closest prior art (Article 56 EPC).

V. The independent claim 1 of the maintained version, on which the contested decision is based and which also serves as the main request for the present decision, reads as follows:

""Use of at least one fatty acid ester of the formula (I)

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC    (I)

wherein

R**(1) is the carbon residue of a saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched fatty acid, and

R**(2) is optionally branched C1-C20 alkyl, optionally branched C1-C20 monohydroxyalkyl, optionally branched C2-C20 dihydroxyalkyl, or optionally branched C3-C20 trihydroxyalkyl,

for reducing stickiness in cosmetic agents for the temporary shaping of keratin fibers,

wherein the cosmetic agents for the temporary shaping of keratin fibers contain as a film-forming and/or setting polymer at least one homo- or copolymer of vinylpyrrolidone or an amphoteric copolymer of octylacrylamide, acrylates and/or methacrylates and butylaminoethylmethacrylate.""

VI. In the statements of appeal and in the further proceedings, the appellants essentially argued as follows:

Appellant I contended that the subject matter of claim 1 was not novel in view of the disclosure of document D2a (Article 54 EPC) and did not involve an inventive step starting from document D3 as the closest prior art (Article 56 EPC).

Appellant II presented its concerns only in the written proceedings. It stated that the claimed subject matter did not involve an inventive step, both starting from document D6 (or D7) and starting from document D3 (or D10, the two documents convey an almost identical technical teaching) as each closest prior art (Article 56 EPC). In the first case, this was particularly the case considering the teaching of document D3 (or D10), and in the second case, particularly considering the teaching of document D6 (or D7).

The objection regarding lack of sufficiency of disclosure (Article 83 EPC) was not pursued further in the appeal.

VII. In its response to the statement of appeal and in the further proceedings, the respondent argued that the novelty of the claimed subject matter over the disclosure of document D2a was given. It also presented arguments as to why document D6 (or D7) should be considered as the closest prior art, but that the claimed subject matter also involved an inventive step regardless of the choice of the closest prior art proposed during the proceedings.

VIII. Requests

Both appellants requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of European patent No. 1 940 347.

The respondent requested the dismissal of the appeals, alternatively the maintenance of the patent in amended form based on auxiliary requests 1 and 2 submitted with letter dated November 28, 2016.

IX. An oral hearing took place on November 16, 2020, in the absence of appellant II. At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeals are admissible.

Main Request

2. Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

2.1 Appellant I argued that document D2a discloses cosmetic products containing the ingredients specified in claim 1 of the main request, particularly in Table 1 in paragraph [0027]. Furthermore, it is evident from the examples described in Table 1 that the fatty acid ester Isotridecylmyristate, which falls under the definition of formula (I) of claim 1, leads to a reduction in the stickiness of the disclosed products. A comparison between comparative example 4 and example 4 in Table 1 shows that an increase in the content of fatty acid esters in the hair cosmetic products leads to an improvement in the assessment of their stickiness. Since comparative example 4 differs from example 4 both in the content of fatty acid esters (Isotridecylmyristate) and in POE (10) Cetyl Ether, the observed reduction in stickiness can initially be attributed to changes in the content of both ingredients. However, the more significant increase in the content of Isotridecylmyristate compared to the relatively smaller decrease in the content of POE (10) Cetyl Ether necessarily has a greater impact on the observed improvement in stickiness. Furthermore, it can be seen from the other examples listed in Table 1 of D2a that fatty acid esters at least do not increase stickiness.

2.2 The respondent disagreed and contested that the mentioned examples directly and unambiguously indicate that the fatty acid ester Isotridecylmyristate is used to reduce stickiness. Moreover, document D2a does not disclose cosmetic products for the temporary deformation of keratin fibers, but rather foaming cosmetic conditioning agents that provide long-lasting moisture and shine to the hair (paragraphs [0001] to [0003]). This application area differs from that of the patent in dispute and requires different requirements regarding the polymers used, which therefore do not exhibit the additional functional feature of claim 1, namely film-forming and/or setting properties.

2.3 The Board is of the opinion that the disclosure of document D2a does not anticipate the subject matter of claim 1.

Document D2a discloses cosmetic hair care products that contain fatty acid esters according to formula (I) of claim 1, as well as copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone (see paragraph [0001] and the examples). In the table referred to by appellant I in paragraph [0027], examples are disclosed. The stickiness of hair after application of the respective compositions is indicated for comparison. Example 4 and comparative example 4 show the stickiness of formulations that differ in their content of the fatty acid ester Isotridecylmyristate and the foam-forming agent POE (10) Cetyl Ether (see lines 4 and 13 in paragraph [0010]). The composition according to example 4 contains 5.0 wt.% of both components, while that according to comparative example 4 contains 1.0 wt.% Isotridecylmyristate and 1.0 wt.% POE (10) Cetyl Ether. As a result, a different stickiness is determined: one to three (out of 10) test persons found the composition according to example 4 to be sticky, while 8 or more (out of 10) found that according to comparative example 4 (see the symbols in the second row from the bottom in the table and explanations on page 7, lines 10 and 12 in paragraph [0024]). Thus, the formulation according to example 4 is characterized by an improved assessment regarding stickiness compared to that according to comparative example 4. However, this improvement cannot be unambiguously attributed to an increase in the amount of fatty acid ester (Isotridecylmyristate) from 1.0 wt.% to 5.0 wt.%, as in example 4, the amount of POE (10) Cetyl Ether is also reduced, being 5.0 wt.% instead of 6.0 wt.%. The skilled person deduces from the description of D2a that the presence of more than 5.0 wt.% of foam-forming agents leads to sticky hair (see paragraph [0012]). Thus, the skilled person receives an explanation for the change in stickiness when transitioning from comparative example 4 to example 4, namely that this is caused by the amount of POE (10) Cetyl Ether in the composition being more than 5.0 wt.% (namely 6.0 wt.%).

2.4 The Board is also not convinced by the argument of appellant I regarding the relative influence of the foam-forming agent and fatty acid ester when comparing example 4 with comparative example 4. While the amount of Isotridecylmyristate is increased more significantly in example 4 (5.0 wt.% compared to 1.0 wt.%) than the amount of POE (10) Cetyl Ether is decreased (5.0 wt.% compared to 6.0 wt.%), this does not necessarily mean that a property possibly based on the presence of both ingredients also changes in the same ratio.

2.5 Therefore, a direct cause for the reduction in stickiness cannot be clearly attributed by the skilled person to the use of the fatty acid ester Isotridecylmyristate when comparing the two referenced experiments (example 4 and comparative example 4).

2.6 Appellant I further based its argumentation on its analysis of the other examples described in Table 1 of D2a. However, from such an analysis, the Board does not see a clear and direct teaching that the use of fatty acid esters leads to a reduction in stickiness. For example, in examples 2 and 6, compared to the respective comparative examples, stickiness is reduced. However, the skilled person primarily explains this by the statements in the description, which indicate that both a content of more than 10.0 wt.% polymer (comparative example 2 (11.0 wt.%) compared to example 2 (2.0 wt.%) and the end of paragraph [0006]), as well as a content of more than 5.0 wt.% ester (comparative example 6 (6.0 wt.%) compared to example 6 (0.5 wt.%) and the end of paragraph [0013]) lead to an increase in stickiness. This explains the difference in the observed stickiness of the mentioned examples. From the comparison between example 6 and comparative example 6, the skilled person even deduces that an increase in the proportion of the fatty acid ester Isotridecylmyristate (from 0.5 wt.% to 6.0 wt.%) leads to an increase in the stickiness of the composition. Furthermore, when comparing examples 1, 3, and 5 with the respective comparative examples, it is observed that there was no change in the assessment of stickiness, even though the content of the fatty acid ester Isotridecylmyristate either increased (example 3: from 0.01 wt.% to 1.0 wt.%), decreased (example 5 from 2.0 wt.% to 0.001 wt.%), or remained unchanged (example 1: 1.0 wt.%).

2.7 Therefore, the Board is of the opinion that the skilled person cannot clearly and directly deduce from the disclosure of document D2a the claimed use of at least one fatty acid ester of formula (I) for reducing stickiness in the described cosmetic products. Since this reduction in stickiness, which is to be regarded as a functional feature of the use claim 1 in accordance with the case law on the second (or further) non-medical use (see in particular G 2/88 and G 6/88, OJ EPO 1990, pages 93 and 114), was not made accessible to the public by document D2a, the document cannot challenge the novelty of the subject matter of this claim.

2.8 Therefore, the novelty objection cannot be convincing.

2.9 Whether document D2a also does not disclose, as argued by the respondent, the functional feature that the cosmetic products for the temporary deformation of keratin fibers only contain those polymers that also exhibit film-forming and/or setting properties is not significant for the assessment of novelty.

3. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

3.1 Closest Prior Art

3.1.1 The patent in dispute generally addresses the issue of stickiness of (hair) styling products (see paragraphs [0001] and [0002] of the description). The objective is stated as reducing the stickiness of styling products, particularly those based on classical film-forming and/or setting polymers (paragraph [0007]). Among these polymers, according to the description, are understood homo- or copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone or an amphoteric copolymer of octylacrylamide, acrylates and/or methacrylates, and butylaminoethylmethacrylate (paragraph [0006]).

The assessment of inventive step was carried out in the opposition decision based on documents D6/D7. The appellants also argued in the appeal proceedings based on document D3.

3.1.2 Document D3 relates to aqueous styling and hair styling products and refers to the associated problem of stickiness (column 1, lines 5 to 10). The document exemplarily discloses dispersions containing a cationic polymer (Salcare SC96, column 2, lines 45 to 47), and optionally the two esters isopropyl palmitate and isopropyl myristate (table at the beginning of column 3, example F). The polymers mentioned in the document, Amphomer and PVA/VA (column 3, line 65 to column 4, line 67), fall under the polymers defined in claim 1 according to the patent in dispute. Document D3 refers to the use of short-chain fatty acid esters in connection with the reduction of stickiness of compositions containing Salcare SC96 (column 2, lines 59 to 65).

3.1.3 Document D6 (D7) concerns, as already established by the opposition division, the provision of non-sticky hair styling products that contain copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone (D6: page 2, lines 19 to 34). The document discloses examples of hair gel that contains the fatty acid ester isopropyl myristate (D6: page 20, lines 21 to 34, page 24, line 40 to page 25, line 15).

3.1.4 The Board is of the opinion that both of the mentioned documents represent possible starting points that can be used to assess inventive step. As explained below, both approaches lead to the same result.

3.2 Document D3 (D10) as the Closest Prior Art

3.2.1 Distinguishing Feature

The claimed use is for at least one fatty acid ester of formula (I) for reducing stickiness in cosmetic products for the temporary deformation of keratin fibers. These products contain as a film-forming and/or setting polymer at least one homo- or copolymer of vinylpyrrolidone or an amphoteric copolymer of octylacrylamide, acrylates and/or methacrylates, and butylaminoethylmethacrylate. The polymer used in example F of document D3 (Salcare SC 96) does not fall under the structural definition of the polymer according to claim 1. However, the example does contain fatty acid esters of formula (I). Thus, a distinguishing feature lies in the type of polymer contained in the cosmetic products. This was undisputed between the parties. Whether further distinguishing features exist, as argued by the respondent during the oral proceedings, remains to be seen, as this is not relevant to the outcome of the appeal proceedings.

3.2.2 Technical Problem and Proposed Solution

During the opposition and appeal proceedings, several proposals were made by the parties and the opposition division for defining the objective technical problem. The Board finds it plausible that this can be seen, starting from D3, in the use of fatty acid esters of formula (I) to reduce stickiness in further cosmetic products.

The definition of the technical problem proposed by the respondent, namely finding a measure that reduces the stickiness of styling products with classical polymers without impairing the styling properties, is considered by the Board to be less suitable, as it already includes the claimed application to classical polymers, and thus part of the solution to the stated problem, in the formulation of the problem.

The solution proposed by the patent in dispute to the problem consists of extending the known use from D3 of certain fatty acid esters to also reduce stickiness in those cosmetic products that contain the polymers defined in the claims.

The examples described in paragraphs [0055] and [0061] of the patent in dispute show that an increase in the proportion of the fatty acid ester isopropyl myristate actually reduces the stickiness of styling products containing Amphomer (comparison of examples 1a with 1b and 2a with 2b). According to paragraph [0022] of the description, Amphomer is a polymer mentioned in claim 1.

Appellant II argued that a reduction in stickiness was not demonstrated across the entire scope of the claim. As already argued in the first instance decision by the opposition division, the properties of one polymer cannot be transferred to other polymers with completely different structures.

However, the Board does not find this argument convincing in the present context. The skilled person was already aware before the filing date of the patent in dispute from document D3 that a reduction in stickiness for compositions containing a cationic polymer (Salcare SC96, column 2, lines 45 to 55) can be achieved by adding the fatty acid esters isopropyl palmitate and isopropyl myristate (column 4, lines 65 to 67). From the examples of the patent in dispute, it is evident that this also applies to compositions containing the polymer Amphomer, which is structurally very different from Salcare SC96. Therefore, the Board finds it credible, based on the results obtained in the examples of the patent in dispute and considering the teaching already known from document D3 at that time, that the fatty acid esters according to formula (I) also lead to a reduction in stickiness when other polymers, particularly those encompassed by claim 1, are present. The appellants did not further specify the claim made. Therefore, the stated problem is considered solved across the entire claimed scope.

3.2.3 Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

The appellants argued that the skilled person would already derive hints towards the claimed solution from document D3. The document discloses that the stickiness of strongly film-forming polymers can be modified by auxiliary substances such as esters (column 1, lines 32 to 35), and that the stickiness of compositions containing more than 5.0 wt.% Salcare SC96 can be reduced by stickiness-reducing auxiliary substances such as short-chain fatty acid esters (column 2, lines 60 to 64; column 3, lines 38 to 43; column 4, lines 65 to 67 and examples E and F of the table in column 4, lines 53 to 60).

The Board is of the opinion that the hints cited by the appellants in document D3 do not lead the skilled person to the claimed solution of the stated problem.

In document D3, the problem of stickiness of hair cosmetic compositions is solved by using ""polyquat-37"" (Salcare SC96, see column 1, lines 49 to 53), a polymer that exhibits significantly reduced stickiness in alcohol/water compared to PVP/VA and Amphomer, both of which are encompassed by the definition according to claim 1 of the patent in dispute (see column 4, lines 15 to 29). The skilled person also deduces from D3 that the stickiness when using this already less sticky polymer can be further reduced by adding conventional additives, such as esters. From the table mentioned in column 4, lines 53 to 60, the skilled person learns that this can be achieved with the esters isopropyl palmitate and isopropyl myristate. Both are encompassed by formula 1 according to claim 1 of the patent in dispute. However, the skilled person also learns from document D3 that this approach is explicitly suggested for ""polyquat-37"" only when this polymer must be used in a higher proportion (see in particular also column 2, lines 60 to 64). Furthermore, the skilled person is alerted that the styling properties when using this polymer are not negatively affected (column 3, lines 39 to 43). The fact that this behavior is presented in D3 as a ""main difference"" would be interpreted by the skilled person as indicating that the use of other polymers is likely to impair the styling properties. Since this property according to the patent in dispute is a primary property (paragraph [0019]), it cannot be assumed that the skilled person would consider adding the mentioned esters even in compositions containing the polymers defined in the claims.

Moreover, the remaining passages cited by the appellants in document D3 do not provide clear hints towards the claimed solution of the technical problem. While column 1, lines 30 to 35 refers to the use of auxiliary substances such as esters in connection with the stickiness of strongly film-forming polymers, the skilled person only generally deduces from this passage that the stickiness can be altered, but it is not specified in which direction this alteration occurs.

The Board also believes that the remaining documents do not provide the skilled person with any hint to use fatty acid esters of formula (I) to reduce stickiness in the claimed cosmetic products. Although the documents cited by the appellants disclose cosmetic products that contain both polymers and fatty acid esters according to claim 1, these are also described as non-sticky (D2a: in particular Table 1, D5: example 67 of Table 12 on page 36 and Table 15 on page 39, D7: here stickiness is only indicated for the polymers (see column 6 of the tables on page 36), but not for the compositions containing them on page 39, line 24, page 43, line 32, page 57, line 31, as well as D11 to D13). However, none of these documents establishes a connection between the use of the fatty acid esters of formula (I) and a reduction in stickiness. Due to the multitude of components in the described products, such a connection cannot be derived without further references.

3.2.4 Therefore, the Board considers that the proposed solution claimed to the technical problem defined starting from document D3 is not suggested by the prior art.

3.3 Document D6 (D7) as the Closest Prior Art

3.3.1 Distinguishing Feature

The examples disclosed in document D6 describe compositions that contain the components mentioned in claim 1. The document only discloses in connection with the component ""isopropyl myristate"" its use as a common component in the oil phase of an O/W emulsion (page 10, lines 17, 33, and 39). In contrast, claim 1 of the patent in dispute refers to the use of the fatty acid esters of formula (I) to reduce stickiness in the cosmetic products disclosed in D6 (D7).

3.3.2 Technical Problem and Proposed Solution

The objective technical problem should also not include any part of the proposed solution based on the teaching of document D6 (D7). No evidence has been presented that the cosmetic products defined in the claim of the patent in dispute exhibit improved, reduced stickiness compared to those disclosed in D6 (D7). Since the claimed products do not differ in composition from those known from D6 (D7), it must also be assumed that they exhibit the same properties, such as stickiness. The Board finds it plausible that the problem starting from D6 (D7) can be seen in providing an alternative use of the fatty acid ester isopropyl myristate disclosed in the document in cosmetic products with a composition also known from this document.

The proposed solution to the problem claimed consists of using fatty acid esters of formula (I) to reduce stickiness in the claimed cosmetic products.

The stated problem is considered solved for the reasons given in point 3.2.2 (see in particular with regard to paragraphs [0055] and [0061] in the patent in dispute).

Appellant I questioned during the proceedings whether fatty acid esters of formula (I) are actually suitable for reducing stickiness in certain cosmetic products, particularly while maintaining the desired styling properties. However, this claim was only raised very late, namely during the oral proceedings. Thus, the respondent had insufficient time to adequately respond to this new objection. Furthermore, no concrete evidence was presented to support the claim. The Board therefore does not take this line of argument into account (Article 13(2) Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal).

3.3.3 Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

The proposed solution to the technical problem is not suggested to the skilled person for the same reasons as explained in point 3.2.3. In particular, the prior art does not provide any hints that fatty acid esters of formula (I) can be used to reduce stickiness in the claimed cosmetic products.

3.3.4 Therefore, the Board, like the opposition division, concludes that the subject matter of the claim is not suggested to the skilled person starting from document D6 (D7).

4. Since the subject matter of independent claim 1 of the main request, and thus also all remaining claims of this request, is not suggested by any of the proposed documents D3 (D10) or D6 (D7), the requirements of Article 56 EPC are also fulfilled.

5. Therefore, there are no reasons against the maintenance of the patent in dispute based on the present main request.

The submitted auxiliary requests can therefore be disregarded.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The complaints are dismissed.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,appeal dismissed,"Beiersdorf AG, L'Oréal",Beiersdorf AG Unnastrasse 48 20253 Hamburg / DE,,"L'Oréal 14, Rue Royale 75008 Paris / FR","L'Oreal, et al, et al Service D.I.P.I. 9, rue Pierre Dreyfus 92110 Clichy / FR",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. European Patent No. 2 054020 (hereinafter: the Patent) was granted with eight claims. These related to a cosmetic agent containing, in a cosmetically acceptable carrier, based on the total agent a) 0.0001 to 0.25 wt.% caffeine and b) 0.01 to 1 wt.% 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (hereinafter: taurine).

II. Two opponents filed oppositions against the grant of the patent. The grounds for opposition cited were lack of novelty and lack of inventive step under Article 100 a) EPC as well as insufficient disclosure under Article 100 b) EPC.

During the opposition proceedings, the following pieces of evidence were mentioned, among others:

D1: EP1685826

D2: WO02074265

D3: DE102004039550

D4: WO2006103037

D5: WO2006018198

D16: US4793992 A

D17: JP11292753

D18: DE10113446 A1

III. The appeals of Opponent 1 (hereinafter Appellant 1) and Opponent 2 (hereinafter Appellant 2) are directed against the decision of the Opposition Division to reject the oppositions.

In the contested decision, the Opposition Division reached the following conclusions:

a) The claimed subject matter of the granted patent was not characterized by the requirement of a synergistic effect and was clearly and comprehensively disclosed in the patent as such.

b) The combination defined in the claims represented a novel selection compared to documents D1, D3-D5, and D10.

c) The closest prior art was document D1. This document described a caffeine-containing agent for application to the scalp, which contained surfactants as penetration aids. Compared to document D1, the claims of the granted patent defined significantly narrower concentration ranges and specifically referred to taurine as a component of the agent. From Tables 4 and 5 of the patent and the test series submitted during the oral proceedings on November 6, 2015, it could be concluded that the patented combination of caffeine and taurine exhibited an increased HGF release compared to the respective individual substances, although not proven to be synergistic across the entire concentration range. As a solution to the problem of providing further methods for promoting hair growth, the claimed subject matter of the patent did not arise in an obvious manner from the prior art, including documents D2, D5, and D7.

IV. In her statement of grounds of appeal dated September 15, 2016, Appellant 1 introduced the following new pieces of evidence:

D21: EP09888858A1

D22: ""Factors Affecting the levels of tea polyphenols and caffeine in tea leaves""

She additionally challenged the novelty of the claimed subject matter of the granted patent with respect to document D21.

Appellant 2 submitted the following new piece of evidence with her statement of grounds of appeal dated September 19, 2016:

D23: Nuzzo 2014 ""Controversial Statistics""

V. The Respondent submitted a new main request as well as auxiliary requests 1 and 2 with the response to the appeal. Claim 1 of the main request included the feature that the agent is a shampoo, a hair conditioner, a hair tonic, a hair treatment, a hair cream, a hair lotion, a hairspray, or a hair tincture.

Furthermore, the Respondent supported the response to the appeal with additional experimental datasets (see Tables 1-7 of the response to the appeal) and also submitted the following document:

D24: DE102012218116

VI. In her submission dated July 26, 2017, Appellant 1 criticized the newly submitted main request as an impermissible extension both under Article 123(2) and Article 123(3) EPC.

VII. In its preliminary opinion under Article 15(1) RPBA, the Board expressed concerns under Article 123(2) and 84 as well as Rule 80 EPC regarding dependent claims 4 and 7.

VIII. In their submissions dated February 16, 2021, and March 16, 2021, the Appellants announced that they would not participate in the oral proceedings scheduled for April 16, 2021.

IX. The Respondent (patent holder) submitted a new main request as well as new auxiliary requests 1 and 3 with her submission dated March 16, 2021.

Claim 1 of this main request reads:

""Cosmetic agent, containing in a cosmetically acceptable carrier, based on the total agent

a) 0.001 to 0.25 wt.% caffeine and

b) 0.01 to 1 wt.% 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid

wherein it is a shampoo, a hair conditioner, a hair gel, a hair tonic, a hair treatment, a hair cream, a hair lotion, a hairspray, or a hair tincture.""

X. In the short communication dated March 26, 2021, the Board informed that, in its preliminary view, the new main request could be admitted and that the claims amended according to this request meet the requirements of the EPC.

XI. The oral proceedings scheduled for April 16, 2021, were canceled.

XII. The relevant arguments of the Appellants for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) The original claim 14 related to so-called rinse-off formulations, such as shampoos. This subject matter was not properly disclosed and was not pursued further during the examination procedure. The inclusion of features related to these products in claim 1 of the main request adds a non-disclosed technical contribution and constitutes an impermissible extension of the scope of protection of the patent.

b) The synergistic effect claimed in the patent for caffeine and taurine cannot be derived from the experimental results reported in the patent due to significant standard deviations. Furthermore, the claimed synergistic effect is not substantiated with respect to the experimental results submitted during the oral proceedings before the Opposition Division.

c) Document D5 already describes cosmetic cleansing preparations that contain, among other things, 2.00 wt.% of a distillate from green tea from Cosmetochem and 0.50 or 0.30 wt.% taurine. The caffeine content corresponding to the claimed subject matter of the patent is evident from document D5a.

Document D10 already describes corresponding topically applicable preparations that contain 0.001-10 wt.% caffeine and preferably 0.1-5.0 wt.% taurine.

Document D14 discloses corresponding cosmetic and dermatological preparations that preferably contain 0.1-1.0 wt.% taurine and 0.1-3 wt.% of another active ingredient, such as caffeine.

Document D21 already describes cosmetic preparations that contain 1 or 1.5 g of taurine and 0.05 g of caffeine per 50 ml of water, thus corresponding to the claimed subject matter of the patent.

The claimed subject matter is therefore not novel in view of documents D5, D10, D14, and D21.

d) Documents D1, D7, and D9 already describe caffeine-containing agents against hair loss. Due to the teachings of documents D2, D16, D17, or D18, which describe taurine as a hair growth-promoting component of hair care products, it would have been obvious for the skilled person to combine caffeine and taurine in a formulation to provide further agents with potentially enhanced effects. Alternatively, documents D5, D14, and D21 could also be referenced, as they describe the use of caffeine and taurine in cosmetic formulations.

The experimental results reported in Tables 4 and 5 of the patent show, considering the significant standard deviations, no synergistic increase in efficacy for the combination of caffeine (0.025%) with taurine (0.5%). The experimental results presented during the oral proceedings before the Opposition Division showed that the HGF-releasing activity of the tested compositions was essentially due to the efficacy of caffeine and that in the case of 0.025% caffeine, the additional use of 0.01% taurine even led to a reduction in this efficacy. A critical assessment of the reported experimental results is also warranted in light of document D23. The synergistic effect cited in the patent is therefore not substantiated and cannot be considered for the assessment of inventive step.

Thus, the claimed subject matter lacks the required inventive step.

Appellant 2 additionally argued that the admission of the dataset submitted by the Respondent only during the oral proceedings before the Opposition Division on November 6, 2015, constitutes a violation of Article 113 EPC, as she was not given the opportunity to review the data in a timely manner.

XIII. The relevant arguments of the Respondent for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) The main request is not to be criticized under Article 123(2) and 123(3) EPC, as it has been restricted to agents that were specifically described in the originally filed application and are also explicitly mentioned in the patent document.

b) The preparation of the claimed agents is sufficiently disclosed in paragraphs [0235]-[0237]. The synergistic effect is not a technical feature of the claims, and its repeatability is therefore not relevant for the assessment of the requirement of sufficient disclosure.

c) Document D5 does not indicate that the described cleansing preparations have the claimed caffeine content.

Compared to documents D10 and D14, the claimed combination represents a multiple selection.

Document D21 does not describe the claimed hair care agents.

d) Documents D1, D7, and D9 are to be considered as the closest prior art, as these documents deal with agents against hair loss, unlike documents D5, D14, and D21.

The difference of the claimed subject matter from this prior art concerns the additional use of 0.01-1 wt.% taurine. The defined combination is associated with a synergistic effect. This effect is evident from the experimental results in the patent. The effect has been confirmed by the results of further investigations and the statistical evaluation using FAST and Statistica software, which were submitted with the submissions of November 6, 2014, and September 2, 2015, and with the response to the appeal.

The problem to be solved with respect to the prior art is thus the provision of cosmetic agents in the form of hair treatment agents that lead to a synergistic reduction of hair loss and an increase in hair growth.

As a solution to this problem, the claimed subject matter does not arise in an obvious manner from the prior art. Although the use of taurine for reducing hair loss and increasing hair growth is known from documents D2 and D18, these documents do not provide any indication of the synergistic enhancement of the effect through the claimed combination of taurine and caffeine.

XIV. The Appellants requested that the contested decision be overturned and the patent be revoked in its entirety.

Additionally, Appellant 2 requested that the completion of a previously submitted incomplete dataset, which was only submitted by the patent holder during the oral proceedings before the Opposition Division, not be considered in the appeal proceedings.

The Respondent requested that the appeal be dismissed and the patent be maintained according to the main request submitted with the letter dated March 16, 2021, or alternatively according to auxiliary requests 1-3.","Reasons for the Decision

Right to be Heard

1. The Opposition Division based its decision, among other things, on the experimental results submitted during the oral proceedings on November 6, 2015. According to Appellant 2, this violates Article 113 EPC, as they were not given the opportunity to review the data in a reasonable time.

During the oral proceedings, the newly submitted measurement data from the patent holder were discussed, and according to the minutes of the oral proceedings, no request was made by Appellant 2 to review these measurement data, so the Board does not see any violation of the right to be heard. Furthermore, since these measurement data are the subject of the Opposition Division's decision, they are part of the appeal proceedings (Article 12(1)(a) RPBA).

Allowability of the Main Request

3. Objections under Articles 123(2) and 123(3) EPC.

The amendments to the patent according to the present main request concern the additional definition in claim 1 that it relates to a shampoo, a hair conditioner, a hair gel, a hair tonic, a hair treatment, a hair cream, a hair lotion, a hair spray, or a hair tincture, as well as the deletion of granted claim 7.

The amended claim 1 is based on originally filed claims 1, 2, 6, and 7 in connection with the originally described preferred embodiment of the means according to the invention (see page 47, lines 14-16 of the originally filed application).

Compared to the granted claim 1, this amendment of the subject matter of the claim constitutes a limitation.

In this context, the Board considers it irrelevant that dependent claim 14 of the originally filed application, which was also directed to corresponding hair care products, was not included in the set of claims of the granted patent, because the granted independent claim clearly encompassed these means and the granted patent explicitly referred to these means as a preferred embodiment in paragraph [0199].

The deletion of granted claim 7 does not give rise to further objections.

Thus, the main request meets the requirements of Articles 123(2) and 123(3) EPC.

4. Disclosure of the Invention

The claims of the main request relate to specific cosmetic means that contain caffeine and taurine in defined concentration ranges. This subject matter is not characterized by the requirement of a synergistic effect. These are known classes of hair care products and known components of such products. The Board therefore sees no reason why the skilled person would not be able to produce the claimed products without undue effort based on the patent. The main request thus fulfills the requirement of Article 83 EPC.

5. Novelty

5.1 Document D5 describes cosmetic cleansing preparations that contain, among other things, 2.00 wt.% of a product from green tea from Cosmetochem (Herbasol Distillate green tea COS 247/106 E Camellia sinensis extract) and 0.50 or 0.30 wt.% taurine (see pages 50 and 51, 2nd example series, examples 5 and 6). Document D5a concerns an email in which the manufacturer of the green tea product (Lipoid Kosmetik, formerly Cosmetochem) states that distillates and extracts containing caffeine were produced for certain customers and that these distillates, like the product mentioned in Document D5, contained approximately 0.1% caffeine and the extracts approximately 0.3% caffeine.

According to the Board, Document D5a does not indicate that the specified caffeine content of the green tea distillate used according to Document D5 was publicly accessible. The information from Documents D10 and D22 that green tea leaves contain about 2.5-3 wt.% caffeine (see D10 page 9, 2nd paragraph and D22 Table 2) does not allow for clear conclusions regarding the caffeine content of the green tea distillate used according to Document D5. Therefore, the products defined in the claims could not be directly and unambiguously derived from Document D5.

5.2 Document D10 describes topically applicable preparations that contain a compound from group a), which includes caffeine, and a compound from group d), which includes taurine (see D10: page 6, lines 6-24, page 11, lines 6-12). However, the Board cannot see that Document D10 clearly and directly discloses the combination of caffeine and taurine, let alone that Document D10 discloses the combination of these ingredients in the claimed defined concentration ranges.

5.3 Document D14 describes cosmetic preparations that preferably contain 0.3 wt.% taurine (see claims 1 and 4 and paragraph [0043]). These preparations are described as good vehicles for cosmetic and dermatological active ingredients (see paragraph [0222]), with caffeine mentioned in a list of active ingredients (see paragraphs [00223] and [00227]) and the amount of these active ingredients being in particular 0.1-3 wt.% (see paragraph [0254]). The claimed combination of taurine with the defined amounts of caffeine does not clearly and directly emerge from Document D14.

5.4 Document D21 describes microemulsions for providing, among other things, aqueous cosmetic preparations (see paragraph [0044]). The preparations according to manufacturing examples 2-5 contain 1 or 1.5 g of taurine per 50 ml of water, corresponding to a content of 2 or 3 wt.% taurine. In contrast, the claims of the present main request define an upper limit for the taurine content of 1 wt.% and thus do not include the preparations from Document D21.

5.5 The Board is therefore convinced that the documents cited by the appellants as novelty-destroying, namely D5, D10, D14, and D21, do not anticipate the novelty of the subject matter of the main request. Thus, the main request fulfills the requirement of Article 54 EPC.

6. Inventive Step

6.1 According to the description of the patent, the objective of the claimed invention is to provide cosmetic means that particularly effectively reduce premature hair loss or promote hair growth (see paragraphs [0008] to [0011]).

Documents D1 and D7, which belong to a patent application family, and Document D9 also relate to the provision of caffeine-containing means against hair loss (see D1 paragraphs [0010] to [0020], D7 paragraphs [0010] to [0020], and D9 page 2, lines 1-3) and are considered the closest prior art. In contrast, Documents D5, D14, and D21 do not deal with means against hair loss and therefore cannot be considered the closest prior art.

Documents D1/D7 describe the combination of caffeine (0.1-10%, for example, 0.3%) with anionic and amphoteric surfactants (0.5-10%) as a penetration aid, which can be included in a shampoo and supplemented with further active ingredients (see D1 paragraphs [0011], [0013], and [0030], D7 paragraphs [0013], [0016], and [0035]). Document D9 describes the combination of caffeine (0.01-10 wt.%) with C10-C18 fatty acids (0.01-10 wt.%), which can be included in a hair tonic possibly with additional active ingredients (see page 2, lines 58-64, page 3, lines 26-32 and 47-52, and page 4, lines 1-17). However, Documents D1/D7 and D9 do not describe the combination with taurine.

6.2 The patent describes that the two components caffeine and taurine interact synergistically and refers to results from studies on dermal papilla cells (see paragraph [0011]). Examples B and C of the patent (see paragraphs [0241]-[0251]) report in this context that the combination containing 0.5% taurine and 0.025% caffeine synergistically induces the release of the growth factor HGF (Hepatocyte Growth Factor), reduces the activity of the gene for IGFBP3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3), and increases the activity of the HGF gene, and tends to activate the gene for KGF (Keratinocyte Growth Factor). According to the patent, these results regarding important signaling molecules of the hair cycle suggest a potentiated, synergistic effect of the combination of caffeine and taurine concerning hair growth and reduction of premature hair loss (see paragraphs [0252]-[0252]). According to the contested decision, the experimental results reported in the patent indicated a marked increase in HGF release upon application of the employed mixture (see Reasons for the Decision page 7, last paragraph), but there was a lack of evidence for a synergistic effect, particularly across both concentration ranges defined in claim 1 (see Reasons for the Decision page 8, paragraph 2).

According to the submission of the respondent dated September 2, 2015, in the opposition proceedings (see page 5), the statistical evaluation of further experimental results using FAST software from Accelrys shows, however, that the synergistic increase in the release of the growth factor HGF also arises from further combinations in which the taurine content varied between 0.01-0.5% and the caffeine content between 0.001-0.025%. This evaluation is explained in the response to the appeal based on the mean values of HGF release submitted during the oral proceedings before the Opposition Division (see page 11, Table 1) and is supported by further experimental results analyzed using Statistica software (see pages 12-13, Table 3).

The appellants contested the significance of the determined average values due to the substantial standard deviations and questioned the traceability of the assessment regarding individual results. Furthermore, a general criticism of problematic interpretations of p-values was pointed out (see Document D23). However, the appellants did not address the further experimental results submitted with the response to the appeal and did not engage with the specific statistical analysis methods employed by the respondent based on the entire raw data, let alone refute the respondent's conclusion with their own experimental results.

Based on the available data and considering the usual standard at the EPO for the assessment of evidence, namely weighing the probabilities (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 9th edition, III.G.4.3), the Board is therefore of the opinion that a synergistic effect of the combination of caffeine and taurine in the claimed defined concentrations on the release of signaling molecules important for the hair cycle can be assumed. Consequently, the Board sees the objective technical problem underlying the claimed invention as the provision of hair care products that reduce hair loss or stimulate hair growth while exhibiting a particular increase in effectiveness.

6.3 The skilled person tasked with providing further hair care products that reduce hair loss or stimulate hair growth could consider Document D2 due to the indications of the addition of further active ingredients in Documents D1/D7 and D9.

From Document D2, it was already known that the application of hair treatment products containing betaines (0.05-10 wt.%), such as taurine, and possibly other effective substances can significantly improve hair growth (see page 2, lines 1-2, page 4, line 34, page 5, lines 4-10, and page 7, lines 1-3).

Based on the teaching from Document D2, the skilled person could thus suspect that the means known from Documents D1/D7 or D9 could be supplemented by an appropriate addition of taurine. A similar suspicion could also arise from Documents D16-D18, as these documents also disclose the use of taurine in means for stimulating hair growth.

However, the Board does not see any reason in the cited prior art to expect a particular, synergistic increase in effectiveness from the combination of caffeine and taurine in the defined concentration ranges. Thus, the skilled person could not arrive at the claimed invention as a solution to the objective technical problem in an obvious manner.

Consequently, the Board concludes that the subject matter of the main request involves an inventive step and thus also fulfills the requirement of Article 56 EPC.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1.

I. The appeal is directed against the decision of the Opposition Division to revoke European Patent EP 2 307 358 under Article 101(3)(b) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged under Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC) and lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

III. During the proceedings, the following documents were referenced, which are also relevant for the present decision:

IV. In the opposition proceedings, the patent owner defended their patent in amended form. The Opposition Division concluded in its decision that the main request was not allowable due to lack of novelty in view of the disclosure of document D9-O2 (Article 54 EPC). The only auxiliary request submitted was also found not allowable due to lack of inventive step, particularly based on the technical teaching of document D2-O1 (Article 56 EPC).

V. The patent owner filed an appeal against this decision. With the statement of grounds of appeal, an experimental report and an auxiliary request were submitted.

VI. In response to the statement of grounds of appeal, the respondents (Opponents 1 and 2) presented arguments against the allowability of the submitted requests. Both respondents submitted new documents to support their respective arguments and requested their admission into the proceedings. Respondent 1 also requested that neither the auxiliary request submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal nor the simultaneously submitted experimental report be admitted into the proceedings.

VII. The appellant subsequently submitted two further auxiliary requests (new first auxiliary request and auxiliary request 3, with the auxiliary request submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal being pursued as auxiliary request 2) and argued for their admissibility and allowability. The new first auxiliary request is identical to the auxiliary request already submitted in the opposition proceedings, which is also the subject of the contested decision.

VIII. Respondent 1 commented again in writing on this matter. They requested that the further auxiliary requests also not be admitted into the proceedings.

IX. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the parties were informed of the preliminary assessment of the Board. The Board expressed the preliminary view that the subject matter of the main request was not novel in view of the disclosure of document D9-O2. It further indicated that the question of the presence of an inventive step would be a subject of discussion during the oral proceedings. Regarding the experimental report submitted by the appellant, the Board informed the parties that it intended to make the admission dependent on its relevance to the proceedings. The Board also expressed the preliminary opinion to admit auxiliary request 2 into the proceedings, but not auxiliary request 1. The admission of auxiliary request 3 would be decided depending on its relevance during the oral proceedings.

X. Claim 1 of the main request, on which the contested decision is based, has the following wording (the definitions of the hardener components a1) and a2) are provided in a shortened form by the Board):

A mixture containing a hardener component a1), a hardener component a2), and a hardener component b), characterized in that

as hardener component a1)

a polyetheramine with a functionality >= 2,

as hardener component a2)

another amine with a functionality >= 2, and

as hardener component b)

5 to 55 wt.-% based on the mixture, of the compound of formula I,

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

with R1 to R3, R5, and R6 independently selected from the group of hydrogen; and an organic residue with 1 to 20 C-atoms, and R4 is selected from the group of an organic residue with 1 to 20 C-atoms and a -C(NH)NR5R6- group;

wherein the ratio of a1) to a2) is in the range of 0.1 to 10 to 1, wherein

as hardener component a1)

a polyetheramine with a functionality >= 2 selected from the group of (...),

as hardener component a2)

another amine with a functionality >= 2 selected from the group of (...),

are used.

XI. Claim 1 of the second auxiliary request relevant for the decision has the following wording:

A mixture containing a hardener component a1), a hardener component a2), and a hardener component b), characterized in that

as hardener component a1)

a polyetheramine with a functionality >= 2, is selected from the group of polyetheramine D 230, polyetheramine D 400, polyetheramine T 403, and polyetheramine T 5000,

as hardener component a2)

another amine with a functionality >= 2, is selected from the group of isophoronediamine, aminoethylpiperazine, 1,3-bis(aminomethyl)-cyclohexane, and triethylenetetramine, and

as hardener component b)

5 to 55 wt.-% based on the mixture, tetramethylguanidine;

wherein the ratio of a1) to a2) is in the range of 1.5 to 10 to 1.

XII. Claim 1 of the third auxiliary request relevant for the decision has the following wording:

A mixture containing a hardener component a1), a hardener component a2), and a hardener component b), characterized in that

as hardener component a1)

a polyetheramine with a functionality >= 2, which is a difunctional, primary polyetheramine based on polypropylene glycol with an average molecular weight of 230,

as hardener component a2)

another amine with a functionality >= 2, namely isophoronediamine, and

as hardener component b)

5 to 55 wt.-% based on the mixture, tetramethylguanidine;

wherein the ratio of a1) to a2) is in the range of 0.1 to 10 to 1.

XIII. In her statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

The contested decision is erroneous because document D9-O2 does not disclose, contrary to the view of the Opposition Division, a mixture containing a claim-defined hardener component b). Therefore, the subject matter of the main request is novel.

The assessment of inventive step is also erroneous, already because the assessment by the Opposition Division does not start from the closest prior art D2-O2. This argument is particularly supported by the experimental report submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal. Even starting from the document D2-O1 used by the Opposition Division, however, the claimed subject matter is based on an inventive step. This applies particularly to the subject matter of the submitted auxiliary requests.

All submitted auxiliary requests should be admitted into the proceedings, as they were either already part of the opposition proceedings or were submitted as a direct reaction to the decision of the Opposition Division or the submissions of the respondents in the appeal proceedings.

XIV. In their responses to the statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the respondents essentially argued as follows:

The question of the novelty of the subject matter according to the main request was correctly decided for the reasons stated in the opposition decision. The presence of an inventive step should be assessed negatively based on each of the documents D2-O1, D2-O2, or D9-O2. The technical problem should merely be seen as providing an alternative, the solution of which is suggested to the skilled person in an obvious manner by the prior art.

Regarding the admissibility of the auxiliary requests, respondent 1 further argued:

Auxiliary request 1 was already submitted during the oral proceedings of the opposition proceedings. However, since the statement of grounds of appeal did not rely on it, the request was withdrawn. It is also unclear, and the appellant has not shown that the request is prima facie allowable. Auxiliary request 2 does not meet the requirements of Rule 80 EPC. Auxiliary request 3 could have been submitted earlier. Claim 1 of this request is also unclear.

XV. Requests of the Parties

The appellant (patent owner) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the contested patent in amended form based on one of the main or auxiliary requests 1 to 3 submitted with the letter of December 20, 2019, partly referring back to earlier requests.

The respondents (Opponents 1 and 2) requested the dismissal of the appeal, thereby confirming the revocation of European Patent No. 2 307 358 in full. Respondent 1 (Opponent 1) also requested that the experimental report submitted by the appellant with the statement of grounds of appeal and auxiliary requests 1 to 3 not be admitted into the proceedings.

XVI. On July 5, 2021, an oral hearing was held, with the consent of all parties, in the form of a video conference. At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Main Request - Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

2.1 The opposition division holds in its decision that the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request is not novel in view of the disclosure of document D9-O2, particularly not in view of the mixture disclosed in example 1 therein. The appellant argued that the claimed mixture is novel because it contains a hardener component b) in the form of a compound of formula I, which is not disclosed in D9-O2. Although the mixture disclosed in example 1 of document D9-O2 contains the compound ""Dicyandiamide,"" the appellant believes that this does not fall under the claimed definition of formula I. This definition excludes the presence of a ""-CN"" group at the position of substituent R4, which is also evident from paragraphs [0040] and [0041] of the description of the contested patent. Furthermore, the mixture component ""Dicyandiamide"" of example 1 of the prior art D9-O2 is to be regarded as a curing accelerator according to paragraph [0038] of the contested patent and could also be included as an additional component in the claimed mixture. Therefore, the skilled person would not consider it as a compound encompassed by formula I of hardener component b).

2.2 Both respondents disagreed with this view. In their opinion, the definition of substituent R4 given in the claim is clear, as can be particularly seen from documents O1-D14, O1-D15, and D9-O2. Therefore, additional information contained in the description of the contested patent should not be used to interpret the subject matter of the claim. Both respondents also interpreted paragraphs [0040] and [0041] of the contested patent in such a way that the paragraph [0041] referring to substituent R4 does not contain any definition that contradicts the definition in the claim, and that paragraph [0040] merely refers to the definition of the other substituents of the compound of formula I, namely substituents R1 to R3, R5, and R6. Furthermore, appellant 2 argued that the designation of the compound ""Dicyandiamide"" as an accelerator does not exclude its properties as a hardener component, which is confirmed by D3-P, section 15.1.4.

2.3 The parties' views only differ in whether the compound ""Dicyandiamide"" mentioned in example 1 of document D9-O2 falls under the definition of the compound of formula I designated as hardener component b), or not. This is the case if the definition according to formula I for substituent R4 includes the group ""-CN.""

2.4 In claim 1 of the main request, the compound of formula I is defined, among other things, by stating that the substituent R4 ""is selected from the group of an organic residue with 1 to 20 carbon atoms and a -C(NH)NR5R6 group."" In the chamber's view, this definition has a clear technical meaning for the skilled person. This is evident, for example, from documents O1-D14 and O1-D15, which reveal general technical knowledge. In document O1-D14, the term ""organyl group"" is defined as ""... an organic residue - regardless of what functional group is contained therein - with one or, less frequently, several free valences at a carbon atom."" According to O1-D14, a ""nitrile group,"" i.e., a ""-CN"" group, is an example of such an organyl group and thus an organic residue with one carbon atom, which therefore falls under the claimed definition of a substituent R4. Document O1-D15 also defines ""organyl groups"" as organic substituents that, regardless of their further functionalities, have a free valence at a carbon atom.

2.5 Based solely on the definition in the claim, the chamber considers it questionable whether the skilled person would refer to additional information from the description when assessing whether the compound ""Dicyandiamide"" mentioned in D9-O2 falls under the definition of formula I. Even if they did, this would not lead to a different assessment. The substituent R4 is defined in paragraph [0041] of the description. However, here, in addition to the indication of preferred groups, the identical definition already contained in claim 1 is found and has been discussed above. Although paragraph [0040] specifies what is to be understood by the term ""organic residue"" in connection with the definition of the residues R1 to R3, R5, and R6 of formula I, this definition apparently refers to those residues. That it should also be correspondingly applied to residue R4 is not disclosed in the present description, particularly since the subsequent paragraph [0041] refers to its definition.

2.6 Regarding the appellant's argument concerning the designation ""curing accelerator"" in document D9-O2, the chamber also shares the view held by the respondents. Although the compound ""Dicyandiamide"" is listed under the group of accelerators in paragraph [0038] of the contested patent, this does not exclude that the skilled person also considers it as falling under the definition of hardener component b). Document D3-P reveals in section 15.1.4 on page 194 that Dicyandiamide is a compound used as a hardener. In document D9-O2 itself, Dicyandiamide is also listed as a component of the curing agent mixture B) of an epoxy resin composition (see (component B1) in paragraph [0006]). This composition may also additionally contain a curing accelerator (component C) in paragraph [0006]).

2.7 Thus, even considering the information from the description of the contested patent, the skilled person concludes that the formula I defined in claim 1 encompasses the compound Dicyandiamide. No further possible distinguishing features between the claimed mixture and the mixture disclosed in example 1 of document D9-O2 were presented by the appellant. The chamber also cannot identify any. Therefore, the subject matter of claim 1 according to the present main request is already disclosed in the prior art, in the form of the mixture according to example 1 of document D9-O2.

2.8 Since the subject matter of claim 1 according to the main request is not novel in view of the disclosure of document D9-O2 (Article 54 EPC), the request cannot be granted.

3. Auxiliary Requests - Admissibility

3.1 Auxiliary requests 1 to 3 were submitted before the entry into force of the amended Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal on January 1, 2020, so that the Rules of Procedure in the version of October 25, 2007 (VOBK 2007) apply for their admissibility (Article 25(2) VOBK 2020).

3.2 Respondent 1 objected that auxiliary request 1, which had already been submitted during the oral proceedings of the opposition proceedings, was only resubmitted with the response to the appeal replies. Therefore, it is not admissible.

The request is identical to auxiliary request 1 of the opposition decision, which was submitted by the patent proprietor/appellant during the oral proceedings in the opposition proceedings as ""new auxiliary request 1,"" and which underlies the contested decision (see annex to the decision of the opposition division). The request could therefore have been submitted already with the appeal statement. However, the appellant chose to resubmit it at a later time, namely as a response to the respondents' replies to the appeal statement. They justified this approach during the oral proceedings by stating that the admissibility of the auxiliary request initially submitted with the appeal statement (now auxiliary request 2) was questioned by respondent 1 in their response to the appeal. The chamber does not find this to be a convincing justification for the late submission of a request that has already been decided upon in the opposition division's decision, as the appeal statement must contain the complete factual presentation of a party (Article 12(2) VOBK 2007). Therefore, the appeal of the patent proprietor does not initially target the decision of the opposition division regarding this request. The subsequent resubmission of the request also violates the required procedural economy, in the chamber's view. It also holds that the request should have been submitted with the appeal statement.

The late-submitted auxiliary request 1 is therefore not admitted into the proceedings (Article 13(1) VOBK 2007).

3.3 Respondent 1 also requested that auxiliary requests 2 and 3 not be admitted. The chamber did not follow these requests. However, as explained in the following points 4 and 5, none of these requests meets the requirement of Article 56 EPC. Therefore, none of these requests can be granted, and thus the reasons for their admissibility are irrelevant for the decision.

4. Auxiliary Request 2 - Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

4.1 Closest Prior Art

The contested patent deals with amine-containing multi-component mixtures and their use for curing epoxy resins, particularly for use in the production of fiber-reinforced plastics. The description refers to the problems associated with the production of large components, such as an increase in viscosity during processing time and control of the curing of the resin. As examples of large components, rotor blades for wind turbines are mentioned, among others. The description also refers to the infusion technology used in their production, which places specific demands on the properties of the hardeners used (see paragraphs [0002], [0005], [0010], and [0012]).

The parties proposed documents D2-O1 and D2-O2 as possible closest prior art. The chamber finds the appellant's argument convincing that document D2-O2 is a more suitable starting point for assessing inventive step. The document deals with the provision of epoxy resin compositions for use in fiber-reinforced materials (see point 8 on page 37). Rotor blades for wind turbines are mentioned as examples (see page 38). It is also specifically pointed out that a low viscosity and sufficient pot life, as well as the exceptionally good adhesion of the obtained resins to fibers, are achieved (see paragraph 3 on page 38). Curing conditions are exemplified as 16 hours at a temperature of 60 °C, or one hour at 120 °C (see page 39, last line). This falls within the range of the conditions specified in the contested patent (see paragraphs [0010], [0012]). In contrast, although document D2-O1 also discloses mixtures for amine curing of epoxy resins, the appellant has argued that the hardener compositions used do not necessarily appear suitable for use in infusion processes due to their viscosity, as particularly in the examples, compositions are described that are processed by kneading (see page 213, left column, lower half, particularly the penultimate paragraph). Therefore, document D2-O2 is considered a more suitable starting point for assessing inventive step.

The respondents argued that document D2-O1 is at least equally suitable as a starting point for assessing inventive step. Their argument led to the conclusion that the subject matter of the claim does not involve an inventive step. However, as shown below, since the subject matter of the claim is also suggested by the document D2-O2 proposed by the appellant, an additional consideration following the respondents' argument is not decisive for the proceedings.

4.2 Distinguishing Feature and Objective Technical Problem Solved

Document D2-O2 discloses on page 37 a composition ""E"" that contains the polyether amine JEFFAMINE D-230 and the compound isophorondiamine (IPDA) in a ratio of 25 to 5. These compounds fall under the definition of hardener component a1 (polyether amine D 230) and hardener component a2 (isophorondiamine) of the mixture according to claim 1 of auxiliary request 2. The subject matter of the claim differs from composition ""E"" according to D2-O2 in that it contains 5 to 55 wt.-%, based on the mixture, of tetramethylguanidine as an additional hardener component b).

The appellant referred to the experimental data contained in the description of the contested patent regarding a technical effect brought about by the distinguishing feature. In fact, the table in paragraph [0060] of the description shows that the addition of tetramethylguanidine to a mixture of polyether amine D 230 and IPDA and the use of this mixture for curing epoxies leads to an increase in the pot life of the obtained composition (line 1 of the table: increase from 75 min at 0 weight parts TMG to up to 125 min at 30 weight parts TMG in the mixture). Furthermore, the curing speed is also positively influenced, which is demonstrated by a reduction in the vitrification time for TMG-containing compositions (see paragraphs [0062] and [0063] and figure 3).

In line with the appellant's argument, the objective technical problem can thus be seen as providing an improved amine-based mixture for curing epoxy resins compared to mixture ""E"" of document D2-O2, with the improvement being an increase in pot life while maintaining or improving curing speed.

4.3 Obviousness of the Claimed Solution

The appellant argued that the claimed solution to the stated technical problem, namely the addition of 5 to 25 wt.-% tetramethylguanidine as an additional component to a hardener mixture known from D2-O2, is not suggested to the skilled person by the prior art. While the skilled person is aware of the use of tetramethylguanidine as a hardener, it is known only as a sole hardener, not as an accelerator for amine curing. Even less is this disclosed in connection with the demonstrated technical effects, namely an increase in pot life and an improvement in curing speed. In particular, table 2 of document D5-O2 (page 21) even shows that the addition of tetramethylguanidine to a DICY-based hardener system leads to a reduction in pot life.

The chamber cannot agree with this argument.

Firstly, document D2-O2 already indicates that accelerators, such as ACCELERATOR 399 (see D2-O2, page 15), can be added to increase curing speed. However, this leads to a reduction in pot life according to D2-O2 (see page 39, first paragraph). Thus, the skilled person will look for further possibilities to achieve a long pot life and high curing speeds at reasonable temperatures based on the teaching of document D2-O2.

As the respondents pointed out, document D3-O2 discloses the use of small amounts of alkylguanidines, such as tetramethylguanidine, for curing epoxy resins. The document states that a long pot life can be achieved with only slightly elevated curing temperatures (column 1, lines 40 to 56, column 2, line 14). It is also mentioned that the addition of further hardeners may be desirable. Polyamines are exemplified (column 6, line 66 to column 7, line 1). Thus, D3-O2 also suggests using tetramethylguanidine together with other hardeners for curing epoxy resins.

Therefore, in the chamber's view, the skilled person, starting from the teaching of document D2-O2 in search of a solution to the stated technical problem, would consider the teaching of document D3-O2. They would thus include tetramethylguanidine as an additional component in a hardener system for curing epoxy resins and expect an increase in pot life.

The appellant has not presented any arguments that the amount of 5 to 55 wt.-% of tetramethylguanidine contained in the mixture has a specific effect. The chamber also cannot see how this proportion leads to a special technical effect. The skilled person, faced with the task of adding a specific amount of tetramethylguanidine, will therefore arrive at the claimed proportion through mere experimentation without engaging in inventive activity.

The appellant's argument regarding document D5-O2, that the addition of tetramethylguanidine to a DICY-based hardener system leads to a reduction in pot life, also does not convince the chamber. Although it is evident from table 2 of this document that the addition of tetramethylguanidine to certain compositions reduces their latency (storage stability), these experiments specifically relate to compositions containing dicyandiamide (Dyh 100S). Even if these are not excluded by the wording of the present claim, the skilled person would not derive the general teaching from the cited passage that tetramethylguanidine generally reduces the pot life of mixtures for amine curing of epoxies. In particular, this would not deter the skilled person from initially implementing the approach proposed in D3-O2.

4.4 Therefore, auxiliary request 2 is not grantable due to a lack of inventive step of the claimed subject matter (Article 56 EPC). For this reason, a discussion of further objections raised by the respondents against the grantability of this request is unnecessary.

5. Auxiliary Request 3 - Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

5.1 Claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 contains modified features compared to claim 1 of auxiliary request 2, which, however, are also already disclosed in example ""E"" of the closest prior art D2-O2, namely JEFFAMINE D-230 as hardener component a1) and isophorondiamine as hardener component a2). Therefore, the situation regarding a lack of inventive step is identical to that of auxiliary request 2.

5.2 Since the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 also does not involve an inventive step in the sense of Article 56 EPC, this request is also not grantable.

6. Appellant's Experimental Report

The appellant submitted an experimental report with their appeal statement and based their argument that document D2-O1 is not a suitable document for assessing inventive step on this report. Respondent 1 requested its non-admission. Since the present decision assesses the question of inventive step based on document D2-O2 (see points 4.1 and 5.1 of this decision), a discussion regarding the admission of the experimental report is unnecessary.

7. In summary, it can be stated that none of the present requests of the appellant-patent proprietor is both admissible and grantable. The revocation of the patent by the opposition division is therefore justified, and the appeal must be dismissed.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,"Hexion Inc., Evonik Operations GmbH","Hexion Inc. 12650 Directors Drive Suite 100 Stafford, TX 77477 / US","Wibbelmann, Jobst Wuesthoff & Wuesthoff Patentanwälte und Rechtsanwalt PartG mbB Schweigerstrasse 2 81541 München / DE",Evonik Operations GmbH Rellinghauser Straße 1-11 45128 Essen / DE,f & e patent Braunsberger Feld 29 51429 Bergisch Gladbach / DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeal is directed against the decision of the opposition division to revoke European Patent EP 2 307 359 under Article 101(3)(b) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged under Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC) and lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

III. In the opposition proceedings, the patent holder defended their patent in amended form. The opposition division concluded in its decision that the main request was not allowable due to lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC), but met the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, among others. The only auxiliary request submitted was also not allowable due to lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

IV. The patent holder filed an appeal against this decision. With the statement of grounds of appeal, an experimental report and auxiliary request 1 were submitted.

V. In response to the statement of grounds of appeal, the respondents (Opponents 1 and 2) presented arguments against the allowability of the submitted requests. Respondent 1 also requested that neither the auxiliary request submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal nor the simultaneously submitted experimental report be admitted into the proceedings.

VI. The appellant subsequently submitted auxiliary requests 2 and 3 and argued for their admissibility and allowability. Auxiliary request 3 is identical to the auxiliary request already submitted in the opposition proceedings, which is also the subject of the contested decision.

VII. Respondent 1 commented again in writing on this matter. They requested that the further auxiliary requests also not be admitted into the proceedings.

VIII. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the parties were informed of the preliminary assessment of the board. The board pointed out, among other things, that questions regarding the amendments made (Article 123(2) EPC) could be the subject of discussions during the oral proceedings. Regarding the experimental report submitted by the appellant, the board informed the parties that it intended to make the admission dependent on its relevance to the proceedings. The board also expressed the preliminary view that the non-admission of auxiliary requests 1 and 2 to the proceedings was not sufficiently justified, but that admission of auxiliary request 3 was not to be expected.

IX. During the oral proceedings, the appellant submitted a new third auxiliary request, which replaced the previously submitted third auxiliary request.

X. Claim 1 of the main request, on which the contested decision is also based, has the following wording:

Blend comprising

alpha) one or more epoxy resins and

beta) a mixture comprising

1) 0.4 to 0.9 amine equivalents, per equivalent

epoxide of the component alpha) used, to a

hardener component a) and

2) a hardener component b),

characterized in that the hardener component a) contains one or more amines with a functionality >= 2 and at least one amine, when stoichiometrically mixed with the epoxy resin in a 100 g batch at room temperature, leads to a curing time of less than 24 h, and the hardener component b) contains at least one compound of the formula I

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

wherein the proportion of the hardener component b) is 5 to 30 wt.-% based on the weight proportion of the mixture and in formula I R1 to R3, R5 and R6 independently represent an organic residue with 1 to 20 C-atoms and hydrogen, and R4 is selected from the group of an organic residue with 1 to 20 C-atoms and a -C(NH)NR5R6 group.

XI. Claim 1 of the first auxiliary request has the following wording:

Blend comprising

alpha) one or more epoxy resins and

beta) a mixture comprising

1) 0.4 to 0.7 amine equivalents, per equivalent

epoxide of the component alpha) used, to a

hardener component a) and

2) a hardener component b),

characterized in that the hardener component a) contains at least two hardener components a1) and a2), wherein the hardener component a1) contains at least one polyether amine with a functionality >= 2, selected from the group of polyether amine D 230, polyether amine D 400, polyether amine T 403, polyether amine T 5000, and the hardener component a2) contains at least one further amine with a functionality >= 2, selected from the group of isophorone diamine, aminoethyl piperazine, 1,3-bis(aminomethyl)cyclohexane, and triethylene tetraamine, and

at least one amine, when stoichiometrically mixed with the epoxy resin in a 100 g batch at room temperature, leads to a curing time of less than 24 h, and

the hardener component b) is tetramethyl guanidine, wherein the proportion of the hardener component b) is 5 to 30 wt.-% based on the weight proportion of the mixture

the ratio of hardener component a1) to hardener component a2) is in the range of 1.5 to 10 to 1 and 10 to 60 mol % less of the mixture is given to the epoxy resin than is required to react the active epoxy groups at the amine functions of the mixture.

XII. Claim 1 of the second auxiliary request has the following wording:

Blend comprising

alpha) one or more epoxy resins and

beta) a mixture comprising

1) 0.4 to 0.9 amine equivalents, per equivalent

epoxide of the component alpha) used, to a

hardener component a) and

2) a hardener component b),

characterized in that the hardener component a) contains at least two hardener components a1) and a2), wherein the hardener component a1) contains at least one polyether amine with a functionality >= 2, selected from the group of polyether amine D 230, polyether amine D 400, polyether amine T 403, polyether amine T 5000, and the hardener component a2) contains at least one further amine with a functionality >= 2, selected from the group of isophorone diamine, aminoethyl piperazine, 1,3-bis(aminomethyl)cyclohexane, and triethylene tetraamine, and

XIII. In her statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

The contested decision was erroneous regarding the assessment of novelty and inventive step, but not regarding the admissibility of the amendments made (Article 123(2) EPC), the intended scope of protection (Article 123(3) EPC), and the sufficiency of disclosure (Article 83 EPC) of the main request.

All submitted auxiliary requests should be admitted into the proceedings, as they were either already part of the opposition proceedings or were submitted as a direct response to the decision of the opposition division or the submissions and arguments of the respondents in the appeal proceedings.

Objections regarding the amendments made and alleged extension of the scope of protection (Article 123(2) and (3) EPC), which were only raised during the oral proceedings before the board, should not be admissible due to their late submission and should therefore not be considered.

XIV. In their responses to the statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the respondents essentially argued as follows:

The subject matter of claim 1 according to the main request has been impermissibly amended and therefore violates the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. Novelty (Article 54 EPC) as well as the presence of an inventive step (Article 56 EPC) must also be denied, as well as sufficient disclosure (Article 83 EPC). Furthermore, the subject matter claimed in the submitted auxiliary requests has been extended compared to the subject matter of the granted patent (Article 123(3) EPC). The claims of the submitted auxiliary requests 1 and 2 are not clear (Article 84 EPC).

The admissibility of auxiliary requests 2 and 3 was also contested. The objection that auxiliary request 1 does not meet the requirements of Rule 80 EPC was not pursued further during the oral proceedings.

XV. Requests of the Parties

The appellant (patent holder) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the contested patent in amended form based on one of the main or auxiliary requests 1 or 2, submitted with the letter of December 20, 2019, partially referring back to earlier requests, or the auxiliary request 3 submitted during the oral proceedings.

The respondents (Opponents 1 and 2) requested the dismissal of the appeal, and thus the revocation of European Patent No. 2 307 359 in its entirety. Respondent 1 (Opponent 1) also requested the non-admission of auxiliary requests 2 and 3, as well as the experimental report submitted by the appellant with the statement of grounds of appeal. The request for non-admission of auxiliary request 1 was not pursued further during the oral proceedings.

XVI. On July 6, 2021, an oral hearing was held, with the consent of all parties, in the form of a video conference. At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Main Request - Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

2.1 In its decision, the opposition division rejected the objections raised by the opponents/respondents regarding inadmissible amendments. The respondents contested this assessment. They argued, on the one hand, that the amended features as such are disclosed in the originally filed description, but that part of the amendments results in a combination of features that was not originally disclosed. On the other hand, they stated that the value for the proportion of the hardener component b) included in the claim does not refer to the said hardener component, but to the entirety of the compounds of formula I.

2.2 The Board finds the respondents' argumentation convincing for the reasons set out below.

2.3 Claim 1 of the main request has been amended compared to the originally filed version in that the amount of hardener component a) in the mixture beta) of the claimed blend now amounts to ""0.4 to 0.9 amino equivalents, per equivalent of epoxy of the employed component alpha)"" instead of ""0.3 to 0.9 amino equivalents, per equivalent of epoxy of the employed component alpha)"". Furthermore, a feature has been added that defines the ""proportion of hardener component b) as 5 to 30 wt.% based on the weight proportion of the mixture"".

The appellant referred to the description as a basis for the amendments made (page 9, line 34 for the feature ""0.4 to 0.9 amino equivalents"" and page 16, line 41 for the feature ""5 to 30 wt.%"").

2.4 In the Board's view, there is at least no sufficient basis in the original description regarding the feature relating to the proportion of hardener component b).

While the range of 5 to 30 wt.% is disclosed at the location indicated by the appellant, it refers to the proportion of formula I in the mixture.

According to the original claim, the hardener component b) contains at least one compound of formula I. It may therefore also contain additional components. If the hardener component b) does not consist solely of one compound of formula I, the proportion of the compound of formula I in the mixture beta) is smaller than the (total) proportion of all components of the hardener component b). The proportion of compounds of formula I in the mixture beta) of the claimed blend is therefore not necessarily identical to the proportion of hardener component b).

However, the amendment made does not take this fact into account. The cited passage of the description does not refer to the proportion of hardener component b) in the mixture beta) of the claimed blend, but to the proportion of formula I. Since these proportions, as explained, are not identical, the passage cannot be used as a basis for the amendment made.

2.5 While, as argued by the appellant, the original application documents as well as the amended claim also limit the upper limit for the proportion of hardener component b) to 30%, this only applies if this hardener component b) consists solely of compounds of formula I and contains no other components. However, this cannot be inferred from the wording of the claim.

2.6 The appellant also argued that a skilled person would derive from the entirety of the application that the cited passage on page 16 of the description, contrary to the actual wording, also refers to the proportion of hardener component b) in the mixture beta) of the claimed blend.

However, the Board cannot derive such a general disclosure from the originally filed application.

First, no proportion of hardener component b) is specified in originally filed claim 1; such is only disclosed in originally filed claim 6. However, there, an upper limit of 55 wt.% is mentioned. Furthermore, a passage supporting claim 6 is already disclosed on page 7, lines 14 to 16 of the original description. This passage refers to the proportion of hardener component b) of 5 to 55 wt.% based on the weight proportion of the mixture. Again, no reference is made to a proportion of 30 wt.%. This value is only disclosed on page 16, line 41, but there, as explained above, for the proportion of formula I in the mixture beta).

2.7 Since claim 1 of the main request has thus been amended in an inadmissible manner and the request consequently does not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, it cannot be granted for this reason alone. Therefore, a discussion of further objections raised by the respondents is unnecessary.

3. Auxiliary Request 1 - Inadmissible Extension of the Scope of Protection (Article 123(3) EPC)

3.1 The respondents argued that the scope of protection of the granted patent has been extended by the amendments made to claim 1. Therefore, auxiliary request 1 does not meet the requirements of Article 123(3) EPC. Respondent 1 had already argued in the written proceedings that, in particular, the specification of hardener component a) leads to an extension of the scope of protection because the reference point of the feature remaining in the claim, which relates to the curing of an amine when mixed with the epoxy resin, has changed. This objection was taken up during the oral proceedings by respondent 2 and further specified, stating that the claimed blends could now also contain components that are not covered by the granted claim 1.

3.2 In the Board's view, claim 1 of the first auxiliary request extends the scope of protection of the granted patent due to the amendments made for the reasons set out below.

3.3 According to granted claim 1, the claimed blend can contain only 0.3 to 0.9 amino equivalents, per equivalent of epoxy of the employed component alpha) of a hardener component a). This hardener component a) is defined as ""containing one or more amines with a functionality >= 2 and at least one amine, when stoichiometrically mixed with the epoxy resin in a 100 g batch at room temperature, leads to a curing time of less than 24 h"". Thus, blends are covered by the claim that contain amines with a functionality >= 2 in an amount of at least 0.3 and at most 0.9 amino equivalents, and at least one of which meets the required curing time under the specified conditions. Blends that contain an amount of an amine with a functionality >= 2 outside the specified range are not covered by the claim. Blends that do not contain at least one of the said amines that also meets the curing feature are also not covered by the claim wording.

3.4 In contrast to the granted claim, the amendments now specify only those representatives of hardener component a) within a certain range that fall under the - specifically narrower definition of hardener components a1) and a2) in the amended claim. The claimed blend can thus also contain other hardener components that are not covered by the narrower definition of the amended claim, in an amount that may also lie outside the originally specified range. Furthermore, the amended claim no longer requires that one of the specific amines contained as hardener component must meet the curing time feature. It is now sufficient that ""one amine"" meets this condition, whereby this amine does not have to correspond to the definition of one of the components a1) or a2). Therefore, as argued by the respondents, blends are now claimed that may contain amines that were excluded under the granted claim, i.e., those that do not fall under the hardener components a1) and a2) specified in amended claim 1, but fall under the broader definition of hardener component a) of the granted claim 1. Since such amines could not be contained in the granted version in an amount of less than 0.3 or more than 0.9 amino equivalents, the amendment made leads to an extension of the scope of protection (Article 123(3) EPC).

3.5 The fact that the range of the proportion in which these amines are contained has also been restricted to an amount of only 0.4 to 0.7 (instead of 0.3 to 0.9) amino equivalents, per equivalent of epoxy of the employed component alpha), does not change this fact.

3.6 The appellant argued that the amendment consists merely of the incorporation of features from granted dependent claims. Therefore, the requirements of Article 123(3) EPC are necessarily fulfilled.

3.7 The Board cannot agree with this argument. While the relevant incorporated features come from granted dependent claims, an additional change has been made in claim 1. Specifically, the condition has been removed that as hardener component a) one or more amines with a functionality >= 2 in the mixture beta) can only be contained within the specified range of at least 0.3 and at most 0.9 amino equivalents. Since this feature was not supplemented by the features from dependent claims that define the hardener component a) in the amended claim, but was replaced by them, it is not merely a matter of incorporating features of dependent claims. To arrive at a claim that meets the requirements of Article 123(3) EPC, the features from the cited dependent claims would have to be added in addition to those already contained in the independent claim, rather than merely replacing them (see the case law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 2019, Chapter II.E.2.4.14).

3.8 The appellant also argued that the objection regarding the feature ""one amine"" in connection with the proportion of ""0.4 to 0.7 amino equivalents"" was only substantiated during the oral proceedings, as explained above. Therefore, the objection is not admissible as a change in the appeal case under Article 13(2) RPBA 2020.

3.9 The Board cannot agree with this argument either. Respondent 1 had already argued in the written proceedings that the removal of the feature that as hardener component a) in the mixture beta) only within the specified range of at least 0.3 and at most 0.9 amino equivalents ""one or more amines with a functionality >= 2"" can be contained leads to an extension of the scope of protection. This submission was further elaborated and specified during the oral proceedings. However, the argument does not relate to a different feature or a different ground for opposition. The Board also does not see that the timing for discussing the reasoning during the oral proceedings was too late. The reason for conducting an oral hearing in the presence of the parties is precisely to discuss issues over which there is disagreement between the parties. This ensures that certain points already raised by one party in the written proceedings are elaborated and deepened so that all parties involved in the proceedings can follow the argumentation and respond to it. Therefore, the Board sees no reason not to consider the respondents' argumentation in this regard.

3.10 Auxiliary request 1 is therefore not grantable because, for the reasons set out above, it extends the scope of protection of the granted patent, Article 123(3) EPC. Further objections raised by the respondents can therefore be disregarded.

4. Auxiliary Request 2

4.1 Admissibility

Respondent 1 requested that auxiliary request 2 not be admitted into the proceedings. The Board did not follow this request. However, since this request is, as explained below, not grantable, the reasons for its admission are irrelevant to the decision.

4.2 Inadmissible Extension of the Scope of Protection (Article 123(3) EPC)

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 differs from claim 1 of the preceding request only in the upper limit of the range for the proportion of hardener component a) in the mixture beta) of the claimed blend, namely 0.9 instead of 0.7 amino equivalents. However, the issue discussed regarding auxiliary request 1 does not change as a result. Thus, the request is also not in accordance with the requirements of Article 123(3) EPC for the reasons already given for auxiliary request 1 and is therefore not grantable.

5. Auxiliary Request 3 - Admissibility

5.1 For the question of the admissibility of auxiliary request 3, the procedural rules that came into effect on January 1, 2020, are to be applied, as this request was only submitted during the oral proceedings.

5.2 The request was submitted by the appellant after the Board had informed the parties during the oral proceedings that auxiliary requests 1 and 2 were not grantable due to non-compliance with the requirements of Article 123(3) EPC. The appellant justified the late submission by stating that the exact reasoning was only presented during the oral proceedings. Respondent 1 requested that the request not be admitted due to late submission.

5.3 The submission of auxiliary request 3 during the oral proceedings before the Board is associated with a change in the appellant's appeal case. The Board holds, as explained in point 3.9 of this decision, that the discussion of the issue regarding an inadmissible extension of the scope of protection in connection with the preceding auxiliary requests during the oral proceedings should be taken into account. However, it does not see compelling reasons that extraordinary circumstances exist that would justify a change caused by the submission of auxiliary request 3 during the oral proceedings. The objection under Article 123(3) EPC had already been the subject of the written proceedings. Since no further arguments were presented by the appellant in this regard, auxiliary request 3 remains disregarded (Article 13(2) RPBA).

6. Experimental Report of the Appellant

The appellant submitted an experimental report with its statement of appeal, the non-admission of which was requested by respondent 1. The appellant based its argumentation regarding the discussion of inventive step on this report during the proceedings. Since this objection is not relevant for the present decision, a discussion on the admissibility of the experimental report is unnecessary.

7. In summary, it can be stated that none of the present requests of the appellant-patent holder is both admissible and grantable. The revocation of the patent by the opposition division is therefore justified, and the appeal must be dismissed.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,"Hexion Inc., Evonik Operations GmbH","Hexion Inc. 12650 Directors Drive Suite 100 Stafford, TX 77477 / US","Wibbelmann, Jobst Wuesthoff & Wuesthoff Patentanwälte und Rechtsanwalt PartG mbB Schweigerstrasse 2 81541 München / DE",Evonik Operations GmbH Rellinghauser Straße 1-11 45128 Essen / DE,f & e patent Braunsberger Feld 29 51429 Bergisch Gladbach / DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeal is directed against the decision of the Opposition Division to revoke European Patent EP 2 307 360 under Article 101(3)(b) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged under Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC) and lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

III. In the opposition proceedings, the patent owner defended the patent in an amended form. The Opposition Division concluded in its decision that the main request was not allowable due to lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC), but met the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, among others. Auxiliary request 1 was also found not allowable due to lack of inventive step. Auxiliary request 2 was not admitted into the proceedings by the Opposition Division.

IV. The patent owner filed an appeal against this decision. A new auxiliary request 1 was submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal.

V. In response to the statement of grounds of appeal, the respondents (Opponents 1 and 2) presented arguments against the allowability of the submitted requests. Respondent 1 also requested that the auxiliary request 1 submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal not be admitted into the proceedings.

VI. The appellant subsequently submitted auxiliary requests 2 and 3 and argued for their admissibility and allowability. Both auxiliary requests had already been submitted during the oral proceedings in the opposition proceedings as auxiliary requests 2 and 1.

VII. Respondent 1 commented again on this in the written proceedings. They requested that the further auxiliary requests also not be admitted into the proceedings.

VIII. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the parties were informed about the preliminary assessment of the Board. The Board pointed out, among other things, that questions regarding the amendments made (Article 123(2) EPC) could be the subject of discussions during the oral proceedings. The Board also expressed the preliminary view that the non-admission of auxiliary request 1 into the proceedings was not sufficiently justified, but that the admission of auxiliary request 3 was not to be expected. Regarding auxiliary request 2, the Board informed the parties that a decision on its admission would depend on the relevance of the request.

IX. Claim 1 of the main request, on which the contested decision is based, has the following wording:

XIII. In her statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

The contested decision was erroneous regarding the assessment of novelty and inventive step, but not regarding the admissibility of the amendments made (Article 123(2) EPC), the intended scope of protection (Article 123(3) EPC), and the sufficiency of disclosure (Article 83 EPC) of the main request.

All submitted auxiliary requests should be admitted into the proceedings, as they were either already part of the opposition proceedings or were submitted as a direct response to the decision of the Opposition Division or the submissions and arguments of the respondents in the appeal proceedings.

Objections regarding the amendments made and alleged extension of the scope of protection (Article 123(2) and (3) EPC), which were only raised during the oral proceedings before the Board, are inadmissible due to late submission and should therefore not be considered.

XIV. In their responses to the statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the respondents essentially argued as follows:

The subject matter of claim 1 according to the main request has been impermissibly amended and therefore violates the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. Novelty (Article 54 EPC) as well as the presence of an inventive step (Article 56 EPC) must also be denied, as well as sufficient disclosure (Article 83 EPC). Furthermore, the scope of protection claimed in the submitted auxiliary requests 1 and 2 has been broadened compared to the scope of the granted patent (Article 123(3) EPC). The claims of the submitted auxiliary requests 1 and 2 are not clear (Article 84 EPC).

The admissibility of auxiliary requests 2 and 3 was also contested, as these requests were submitted late.

XV. Requests of the Parties

The appellant (patent owner) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the contested patent in amended form based on one of the main or auxiliary requests 1 to 3 submitted with the letter of December 20, 2019, partially reverting to earlier requests.

The respondents (Opponents 1 and 2) requested the dismissal of the appeal, and thus the revocation of European Patent No. 2 307 360 in its entirety. Respondent 1 (Opponent 1) also requested the non-admission of auxiliary requests 2 and 3. The request for non-admission of auxiliary request 1 was not pursued during the oral proceedings.

XVI. An oral hearing took place on July 6, 2021, with the consent of all parties, in the form of a video conference. At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Main request - Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

2.1 In its decision, the opposition division rejected the objections raised by the opponents/respondents regarding inadmissible amendments. The respondents contested this assessment. They argued on the one hand that the amended features as such are disclosed in the originally filed description, but that part of the amendments results in a combination of features that was not originally disclosed. On the other hand, they stated that the value for the proportion of the hardener component b) included in the claim does not refer to the said hardener component, but to the entirety of the compounds of formula I.

2.2 The Board finds the respondents' argumentation convincing for the reasons set out below.

2.3 Claim 1 of the main request has been amended compared to the originally filed version in that the amount of hardener component b) in the mixture of the blend to be introduced is now ""0.4 to 0.9 amino equivalents, per equivalent of epoxy of the epoxy resin used"" instead of ""0.3 to 0.9 amino equivalents, per equivalent of epoxy of the epoxy resin used."" Furthermore, a feature was added stating that ""the proportion of hardener component b) is 5 to 30 wt.-% based on the weight proportion of the mixture.""

The appellant referred to the description as a basis for the amendments made (page 9, line 11 for the feature ""0.4 to 0.9 amino equivalents"" and page 16, line 19 for the feature ""5 to 30 wt.-%"").

2.4 In the Board's view, there is at least no sufficient basis in the original description regarding the feature relating to the proportion of hardener component b).

While the range of 5 to 30 wt.-% is disclosed at the location indicated by the appellant, it refers to the proportion of formula I in the mixture.

According to the original claim, the hardener component b) contains at least one compound of formula I. It may therefore also contain other components. If hardener component b) does not consist solely of one compound of formula I, the proportion of the compound of formula I in the mixture is smaller than the (total) proportion of all components of hardener component b). The proportion of compounds of formula I in the mixture of the blend used in the claimed method is thus not identical in every case to the proportion of hardener component b).

However, the amendment made does not take this fact into account. The cited passage of the description does not refer to the proportion of hardener component b) in the mixture of the blend, but to the proportion of formula I. Since this proportion, as explained, is not identical, the passage cannot be used as a basis for the amendment made.

2.5 While it is true, as argued by the appellant, that the upper limit for the proportion of hardener component b) is also limited to 30% in the original application documents as well as in the amended claim, this only applies if this hardener component b) consists solely of compounds of formula I and contains no further components. However, this cannot be inferred from the wording of the claim.

2.6 The appellant also argued that a skilled person would deduce from the entirety of the application that the cited passage on page 16 of the description, contrary to the actual wording, also refers to the proportion of hardener component b) in the mixture of the blend.

However, the Board cannot find such a general disclosure in the originally filed application.

First, no proportion of hardener component b) is specified in originally filed claim 1; such is only disclosed in original claim 6. However, there, an upper limit of 55 wt.-% is mentioned. Furthermore, a passage supporting claim 6 is already disclosed on page 6, lines 2 to 4 of the original description. This passage refers to the proportion of hardener component b) of 5 to 55 wt.-% based on the weight proportion of the mixture. However, it does not refer to a proportion of 30 wt.-%. This value is only disclosed on page 16, line 19, but as explained above, for the proportion of formula I in the mixture.

2.7 Since claim 1 of the main request has thus been amended in an inadmissible manner and the request consequently does not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, it cannot be granted for this reason alone. A discussion of further objections raised by the respondents is therefore unnecessary.

3. Auxiliary request 1 - Inadmissible extension of the scope of protection (Article 123(3) EPC)

3.1 The respondents argued that the scope of the granted patent has been extended by the amendments made to claim 1. Therefore, the request does not meet the requirements of Article 123(3) EPC. Respondent 1 had already argued in the written proceedings that particularly the specification of hardener component a) leads to an extension of the scope of protection because the reference point of the feature remaining in the claim, which relates to the curing of an amine when mixed with the epoxy resin, has changed.

3.2 In the Board's view, claim 1 of the first auxiliary request extends the scope of the granted patent due to the amendments made for the reasons set out below.

3.3 According to granted claim 1, the blend of the claimed method can only contain 0.3 to 0.9 amino equivalents, per equivalent of epoxy of the epoxy resin used, of a hardener component a). This hardener component a) is defined as ""containing one or more amines with a functionality >= 2 and at least one amine, when stoichiometrically mixed with the epoxy resin in a 100 g batch at room temperature, leads to a curing time of less than 24 h."" Thus, blends are included that contain amines with a functionality >= 2 in an amount of at least 0.3 and at most 0.9 amino equivalents, and of which at least one meets the required curing time under the specified conditions. Blends that contain an amount of an amine with a functionality >= 2 outside the specified range are not included in the claim. Also not included in the wording of the claim are blends that do not contain at least one of the said amines that also meets the curing feature.

3.4 In contrast to the granted claim, the amendments now only specify such representatives of hardener component a) within a certain range that fall under the - more specific and thus narrower - definition of hardener components a1) and a2) in the amended claim. The blend of the claimed method can thus also contain other hardener components that are not covered by the narrower definition of the amended claim, in an amount that may also lie outside the originally specified range. Furthermore, in the amended claim, it is no longer required that one of the specific amines contained as hardener component meets the curing time feature. It is now sufficient that ""one amine"" fulfills this condition, whereby this amine does not refer according to the claim wording to one of the components a1) or a2). Therefore, as argued by the respondents, blends are now also included that may contain amines that were excluded according to the granted claim, i.e., those that do not fall under the hardener components a1) and a2) specified in amended claim 1, but fall under the broader definition of hardener component a) of granted claim 1. Since such amines could not be contained in the granted version in an amount of less than 0.3 or more than 0.9 amino equivalents, the amendment made leads to an extension of the scope of protection (Article 123(3) EPC).

3.5 The fact that the range of the proportion in which these amines are contained has also been restricted to an amount of only 0.4 to 0.7 (instead of 0.3 to 0.9) amino equivalents, per equivalent of epoxy of the epoxy resin used, does not change this fact.

3.6 The appellant argued that the amendment consists merely of incorporating features from granted dependent claims. Therefore, the requirements of Article 123(3) EPC are necessarily fulfilled.

3.7 The Board cannot agree with this argument. While the relevant incorporated features come from granted dependent claims, an additional change has been made in claim 1. Specifically, the condition that as hardener component a) one or more amines with a functionality >= 2 in the mixture can only be contained within the specified range of at least 0.3 and at most 0.9 amino equivalents has been removed. Since this feature was not supplemented by the features from dependent claims that define hardener component a) in the amended claim, but replaced by it, this is not merely the incorporation of features from dependent claims. To arrive at a claim that meets the requirements of Article 123(3) EPC, the features from the cited dependent claims would have had to be added in addition to those already contained in the independent claim, rather than merely replacing them (see the case law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 2019, Chapter II.E.2.4.14).

3.8 Auxiliary request 1 is therefore not grantable because it extends the scope of the granted patent for the reasons set out above, Article 123(3) EPC. Further objections raised by the respondents can therefore be disregarded.

4. Auxiliary request 2 - Admissibility

4.1 Auxiliary request 2 was submitted before the entry into force of the amended Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal on January 1, 2020, so that the Rules of Procedure in the version of October 25, 2007 (VOBK 2007) apply to its admissibility (Article 25(2) VOBK 2020).

4.2 Respondent 1 objected that auxiliary request 2 was not submitted with the filing of the statement of appeal, but only with the response to the respondents' reply.

4.3 The request is identical to auxiliary request 2 of the opposition decision, which was submitted by the patent proprietor/appellant during the oral proceedings in the opposition proceedings and which was not admitted into the proceedings by the opposition division (see annex to the decision of the opposition division). The request should therefore have been submitted with the statement of appeal, and its admissibility could have been requested. However, the appellant chose to submit it only at a later time, namely in response to the respondents' replies to the statement of appeal. She justified this approach by stating that the admissibility of auxiliary request 1 submitted with the statement of appeal was questioned by respondent 1 in her response to the appeal. Furthermore, she explained that the request was resubmitted in case the Board should follow respondent 1's request to not admit the first auxiliary request. The Board does not find this a convincing justification for the late submission of a request that had already been presented during the oral proceedings before the opposition division, as the statement of appeal must contain the complete presentation of the facts by a party (Article 12(2) VOBK 2007). The complaints of the patent proprietor therefore do not initially target the opposition division's decision not to admit auxiliary request 2 into the proceedings. Furthermore, the subsequent resubmission of the request violates the required procedural economy, in the Board's opinion. It is therefore also of the opinion that the request should have been submitted with the statement of appeal.

4.4 The late-filed auxiliary request 2 is therefore not admitted into the proceedings (Article 13(1) VOBK 2007).

5. Auxiliary request 3 - Admissibility

5.1 Auxiliary request 3 was submitted together with auxiliary request 2. Therefore, the Rules of Procedure in the version of October 25, 2007 (VOBK 2007) also apply to its admissibility, against which respondent 1 also raised objections (Article 25(2) VOBK 2020).

5.2 The request is identical to auxiliary request 1 of the opposition decision, which was submitted by the patent proprietor/appellant during the oral proceedings in the opposition proceedings and which was admitted into the proceedings by the opposition division (see annex to the decision of the opposition division). The request should therefore also have been submitted with the statement of appeal, and its admissibility could have been requested.

5.3 Claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 differs from the main request in that the hardener component a) of the mixture mentioned in step II) of the claimed method is defined more closely, and that the introduction according to step II) of the method is carried out by infusion technology. The claim also differs from the originally filed claim 1 - as does claim 1 of the main request - by the feature relating to the proportion of hardener component b), namely that ""the hardener component b) contains at least one compound of formula I, with the proportion of hardener component b) being 5 to 30 wt.-% based on the weight proportion of the mixture.""

5.4 The request therefore also does not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC for the reasons already mentioned in point 2 of this decision and would therefore obviously not be grantable. Since the admission of this late-filed auxiliary request 3 would also violate the required procedural economy, it is not admitted into the proceedings (Article 13(1) VOBK 2007).

6. In summary, it can be stated that none of the requests of the appellant-patent proprietor is both admissible and grantable. The revocation of the patent by the opposition division is therefore justified, and the appeal must be dismissed.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,"Hexion Inc., Evonik Operations GmbH","Hexion Inc. 12650 Directors Drive Suite 100 Stafford, TX 77477 / US","Wibbelmann, Jobst Wuesthoff & Wuesthoff Patentanwälte und Rechtsanwalt PartG mbB Schweigerstrasse 2 81541 München / DE",Evonik Operations GmbH Rellinghauser Straße 1-11 45128 Essen / DE,f & e patent Braunsberger Feld 29 51429 Bergisch Gladbach / DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The patent holder has filed an appeal against the decision of the opposition division to revoke patent No. 2446247.

II. The opposition division had decided that the subject matter of claim 1 in the granted version according to the main request, as well as the subject matter of claim 1 according to the then auxiliary requests 1 and 2, was not inventive.

III. The oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal took place on February 16, 2021.

IV. The patent holder (appellant) requested as the main request to overturn the contested decision and reject the opposition, or alternatively, to maintain the contested patent in amended form based on the claims of the auxiliary request submitted with the statement of appeal dated October 21, 2016. The present auxiliary request is identical to the second auxiliary request underlying the contested decision.

V. The opponent (respondent) requested the dismissal of the appeal.

VI. The wording of claim 1 according to the main request is as follows:

""Method for detecting water ingress in plants for the production of isocyanates by reacting phosgene with one or more primary amine(s) in a solvent, wherein these plants comprise a reaction and a purification part with solvent recovery, comprising the steps

(a) introducing at least one measuring probe into a condensed phase in the purification part of the plant, in which the content of isocyanate or phosgene is below 5 vol.-%,

(b) detecting at least one signal generated by the at least one measuring probe, and

(c) detecting water ingress in the plants by monitoring the at least one signal.""

Claim 1 of the auxiliary request differs from claim 1 of the main request by the addition of the following features at the end of the method step (a): ""wherein the condensed phase still contains hydrochloric acid and the at least one measuring probe comprises a resistance wire.""

VII. The present decision refers to the following documents:

E1: ""Inline analysis of phosgene, MDI and water in MonoChloroBenzene,"" Research Disclosure, October 2008, # 534018,

E2: DD 139 955; reference is made to the upper page references 1 to 5 of the description of E2, instead of the lower page references 2 to 6.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Main Request - Inventive Step

The subject matter of claim 1 does not involve an inventive step over E2 in combination with the general knowledge of the skilled person (Article 56 EPC).

1.1 It is undisputed between the parties that the subject matter of claim 1 differs from the method disclosed in E2 only by the process step (a). The technical effect of the distinguishing feature lies in the detection of water ingress by introducing a measuring probe at a suitable location in the plant.

1.2 Therefore, the technical problem, as presented by the opponent during the oral proceedings before the Board (see also the Board's communication, point 5.3.2), is to find an adequate location in the E2 plant for the introduction of the measuring probe.

1.3 The process step (a) does not involve an inventive step for the following reasons:

1.3.1 Feature: ""Introducing a measuring probe in the processing part of the plant""

In the embodiment of E2, the measuring devices are installed ""[b]ehind the [...] heat exchangers endangered by possible water ingress"" (E2, page 4, lines 12 to 14). However, this location is not the only possible place to install measuring devices for detecting water ingress in the isocyanate plant. As argued by the opponent (response to the appeal, page 7, third paragraph; oral proceedings before the Board), E2 generally discloses a ""method for detecting water ingress in pipelines and systems conducting phosgene or phosgene-containing media"" (E2, page 4, line 32 to page 5, line 1). See also E2, page 1, second paragraph, where it is disclosed that the invention relates to a method ""for the immediate detection of water ingress in pipes and systems that conduct phosgene or phosgene-containing media."" This means that the measurements in E2 can generally be carried out in any pipeline of the isocyanate plant where phosgene is present. Such phosgene-carrying pipelines are particularly located in the processing part of the plant. Therefore, the application area of the method of E2 is not limited to the introduction of the measuring probe exclusively behind heat exchangers.

In accordance with the contested decision, page 16, point 1.4, the opponent argued that ""it is obvious that the measurement should best take place at the end of the manufacturing process [sic] to determine whether water has entered the plant,"" i.e., in the processing part.

Depending on the circumstances (accessibility of the heat exchangers in E2; presence of other leaking and potentially water-endangered locations in the phosgene-carrying pipelines; need for more accurate or additional measurements of water ingress in the plant), the skilled person would consider alternative locations for the introduction of measuring devices. In particular, the processing part of the plant represents an obvious alternative, and thus the introduction of the measuring probe from E2 into this processing part is an obvious option for the skilled person.

The argument of the patent holder that the skilled person ""only uses the measuring probes in areas of the plants where large amounts of phosgene are present,"" i.e., exclusively at hazard points such as heat exchangers (appeal statement, page 4, last paragraph and page 5, paragraph 4; oral proceedings before the Board), is not convincing in light of the broader teaching of E2 and the customary considerations of the skilled person.

1.3.2 Feature: ""Introducing a measuring probe into a condensed phase""

As convincingly presented by the opponent (response to the appeal, page 7, fourth paragraph; oral proceedings before the Board), the measuring probe in E2 is introduced into a phosgene solution (E2, page 2, last sentence), i.e., into a condensed phase.

The counterargument presented by the patent holder in the contested decision, page 20, point 3.1 (""The skilled person would have no reason to measure in the condensed phase..."") is not understandable to the Board, as E2 explicitly discloses a measurement of water in a phosgene solution. During the oral proceedings, the patent holder argued that while the probe in E2 is introduced into a condensed phase, it does not pertain to the processing part of the plant. The Board is not convinced by this argument because E2 does not disclose that the probe is not introduced into the processing part. In any case, the introduction of the measuring probe from E2 into the processing part of the plant, particularly at a location where the measurement is carried out according to the method described in E2, page 2, last sentence, in a condensed phase, is obvious (see also above point 1.3.1).

1.3.3 Feature: ""the processing part of the plant into which the measuring probe is introduced has an isocyanate or phosgene content of less than 5 vol-%""

As convincingly argued by the opponent in the response to the appeal, page 7, last paragraph, to page 8, second paragraph, the feature of claim 1 ""where the content of isocyanate or phosgene is less than 5 vol-%"" does not have a surprising technical effect. It is generally known that in isocyanate production plants through the reaction of phosgene, there are many locations where the phosgene and/or isocyanate content is low, particularly below 5 vol-%. Depending on the exact location where the measuring probe detects the water content, a phosgene and/or isocyanate content of less than 5 vol-% represents an obvious possibility.

The Board cannot agree with the counterargument of the patent holder that the measurement in E2 takes place in phosgene-carrying systems where phosgene constitutes the main component and thus more than five vol-% is present, because the term ""phosgene-carrying systems"" does not automatically refer to systems in which more than five vol-% of phosgene is present.

2. Auxiliary Request - Inventive Step

The method of claim 1 does not involve an inventive step over E2 in combination with the general knowledge of the skilled person (Article 56 EPC).

2.1 The two features added in claim 1 regarding the presence of hydrochloric acid and a resistance wire are implicitly or explicitly disclosed in E2.

2.1.1 Feature: ""wherein the condensed phase further contains hydrochloric acid""

As convincingly presented by the opponent during the oral proceedings before the Board, it is common knowledge that in a plant for the production of isocyanates through the reaction of phosgene, i.e., in the plant of E2, hydrochloric acid is automatically present in a condensed phase in the processing part. In this regard, the opponent referred to E1, lines 7 and 8, as well as lines 10 to 14. Therefore, the feature ""wherein the condensed phase further contains hydrochloric acid"" is implicitly disclosed in E2.

The patent holder argued during the oral proceedings before the Board that no hydrochloric acid was present in the phosgene solution before the measurement by the zinc wire (see also appeal statement, page 7, paragraph 7). In this regard, the patent holder referred to the sentence bridging pages 2 and 3 of E2. By specifying hydrochloric acid in claim 1, it was indicated at which location the measurement was to take place, namely at a location where hydrochloric acid is present. In contrast, the measurement in E2 would take place at a location without hydrochloric acid. The Board is not convinced by this argument because, regardless of the chemical reactions at the zinc wire of the measuring device of E2 (see E2, page 3, reactions (1) and (2)), hydrochloric acid is present in the condensed phase in the processing part.

In the appeal statement, page 7, paragraph 6, the patent holder argued that the opponent conceded that according to E1 no hydrochloric acid was present. This contradicts the actual statements of the opponent during the oral proceedings before the Board and the explicit disclosure content of E1, lines 7 and 8, as well as lines 10 to 14. When asked by the Board, the patent holder explained that their statement in the appeal statement was due to a misunderstanding of the decision, page 26, point 2.

2.1.2 Feature: ""wherein the at least one measuring probe comprises a resistance wire""

It is undisputed between the parties that the measuring probe of E2 has a resistance wire in the form of a zinc wire (see E2, page 3, lines 17 to 25).

2.2 Therefore, the method claimed in claim 1 of the auxiliary request lacks an inventive step for the same reasons as the method defined in claim 1 of the main request.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,Huntsman International LLC,"Huntsman International LLC 500 Huntsman Way Salt Lake City, UT 84108 / US","Kourgias, Catherine Huntsman (Europe) BVBA Intellectual Property Department Everslaan 45 3078 Everberg / BE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeal of the appellant (opponent) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to reject the opposition against patent EP 1 931 616 under Article 101(2) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the contested patent was challenged in its entirety based on Articles 100(a), 100(b), and 100(c) EPC, namely for impermissible extension (Article 123(2) EPC), lack of sufficiency of disclosure (Article 83 EPC), lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC), and lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

III. During the opposition proceedings, the following documents were referenced, which are also relevant for the present decision:

D1:        WO 03/095410

D2:        EP 0 372 706

D5:        EP 0 574 260

D9:        WO 2005/073260

IV. In its decision, the opposition division concluded that the claimed method is sufficiently disclosed for the skilled person (Article 83 EPC) and that the amendments made during the examination procedure do not constitute impermissible extensions within the meaning of Article 123(2) EPC. Furthermore, the claimed method was considered novel. Starting from D1 as the closest prior art, the opposition division also found inventive step to be present. All objections raised under Articles 100(a), 100(b), and 100(c) EPC were therefore dismissed in the opposition decision.

V. The independent claim 1 on which the patent is based reads as follows:

""Neutralization method, wherein at least one ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid is at least partially neutralized with a base,

characterized in that

the neutralization is carried out continuously, the temperature of the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid is from 0 to 40°C, the neutralized solution is cooled and partially returned to the neutralization, the returned neutralized solution is subsequently treated in the neutralization with a base and ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, and the temperature of the neutralized solution is less than 70°C.""

VI. In the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant argued as follows:

The subject matter of claim 1 of the underlying application has been impermissibly extended during the examination phase (Article 123(2) EPC). The claimed method is not executable by the skilled person across the entire claimed breadth (Article 83 EPC). Furthermore, the subject matter of the claims, starting from document D1, either alone or in combination with D5 or D2, or starting from D9 in combination with D1, does not involve an inventive step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC. The objection regarding lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC) was not pursued further in the appeal.

VII. In her response to the statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the respondent (patent proprietor) argued as follows:

The reasoning put forward by the appellant regarding impermissible extension differs from that presented in the opposition proceedings. It is also not convincing in substance. The claimed method is sufficiently disclosed in the patent, and the appellant does not demonstrate which specific claimed embodiments are not reproducible. The presence of inventive step was considered to be given, regardless of whether D1 or D9 is taken as the closest prior art.

VIII. Requests

The appellant requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of European patent No. 1 931 616.

The respondent (patent proprietor) requested the dismissal of the appeal, alternatively the maintenance of the patent in amended form based on the auxiliary request submitted with the response dated March 13, 2007, to the statement of grounds of appeal.

IX. An oral hearing took place on October 2, 2020, in the absence of the appellant. At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

2.1 The appellant argued in the appeal proceedings that the feature ""... the temperature of the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid is from 0 to 40°C ..."" included in claim 1 during the grant procedure is not supported by the paragraph indicated by the respondent in the originally filed description (page 4, lines 10 to 14), since this paragraph also contains the restriction that when using acrylic acid, a temperature of 15°C must not be exceeded (""must not be below 15°C"" in the appeal). Since this restriction is missing in the amended claim 1, a new technical teaching has arisen, as now an embodiment is also claimed that was specifically excluded in the original application documents, namely the neutralization of acrylic acid at a temperature in the range of 0 to 15°C.

2.2 The respondent argued in its response to the appeal that the reasoning of the appellant differs from that presented in the opposition proceedings. Substantively, the respondent argued that the restriction disclosed on page 4, lines 10 to 14 of the originally filed description and not included in the claim should be understood merely as a recommendation, which moreover applies only to the use of pure acrylic acid.

2.3 The Board agrees with the respondent that the argumentation presented by the appellant in the appeal proceedings differs from the argumentation in the opposition proceedings.

During the opposition proceedings, the appellant/opponent stated that the selection of the feature that ""... the temperature of the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid is from 0 to 40°C ..."" should be criticized as it represents an arbitrary selection. The originally filed application documents also disclosed preferred ranges for other features, for example, the temperature of the aqueous alkali (page 4, lines 31 to 34 of the description). However, these were not included together with the selection of the preferred range for the temperature of the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid in the amended claim (see under paragraph 2 of the notice of opposition, as well as point II-3, paragraph 1 of the contested decision and point 4 of the minutes of the oral proceedings in the opposition proceedings). This argumentation is based on the appellant/opponent's view that the amendment made represents a combination of preferred and non-preferred ranges of different claim features that was not originally disclosed.

The argumentation presented in the appeal proceedings, on the other hand, is based on the fact that the said feature is not used together with a restriction of the same claim feature (temperature of the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid) when neutralizing a specific carboxylic acid (acrylic acid).

2.4 Since the present appeal reasoning was submitted before the entry into force of the revised version of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA) applicable since January 1, 2020, namely on November 18, 2016, Article 12(4) of the version of the RPBA applicable before the entry into force (RPBA 2007) is to be applied according to Article 25(2) RPBA.

The argumentation presented by the appellant in the appeal relates to the inclusion of a feature in claim 1 that had already been discussed in the opposition proceedings. The Board is of the opinion that the objection of the appellant relates to the appeal case and that the requirements of Article 12(2) RPBA 2007 are also considered to be fulfilled, and takes the relevant submissions into account (Article 12(4) RPBA 2007).

2.5 However, in the Board's view, the appellant's argumentation is not convincing for the following reasons:

The appellant did not explain in the appeal proceedings why the opposition division should have made an erroneous assessment of the issue of inadmissible extension based on the arguments presented in the opposition proceedings. Regarding the argumentation presented in the appeal proceedings, the Board follows the argumentation of the respondent. In the passage cited as the basis for the inclusion of the feature that ""... the temperature of the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid is from 0 to 40°C ..."" in the originally filed description (page 4, lines 10 to 14), it is stated that when using acrylic acid, a temperature of 15°C must not be exceeded (emphasis by the Board). The use of ""must not"" clarifies that this is not a substantive feature but a recommendation.

The appellant's argument that the contested amendment has created a new technical teaching is also not considered convincing by the Board. The wording of claim 1 in the submitted version also encompasses the possibility of using acrylic acid at a temperature in the range of 0 to 15°C.

The Board also sees no reason to assess the argumentation presented by the appellant/opponent in the opposition proceedings differently than was done by the opposition division in the contested decision (point II-3 of the opposition decision).

2.6 Thus, the Board concludes that the subject matter of claim 1 of the contested patent has not been unallowably extended.

3. Sufficiency of Disclosure (Article 83 EPC)

3.1 The appellant challenged the sufficiency of disclosure of the claimed method over the entire claimed range. To this end, it presented the following points:

a) The contested patent contains only examples of methods carried out with sodium hydroxide and acrylic acid, and these only at two different temperatures of acrylic acid, namely at 15 and 23°C. Other neutralization methods are not disclosed to the skilled person. Furthermore, paragraph [0023] of the description refers to the fact that when using acrylic acid, a minimum temperature of 15°C must be maintained to ensure a sufficient distance between the temperature of the carboxylic acid and its melting point. However, this does not enable the skilled person to carry out neutralization methods other than those disclosed in the specific examples.

b) Paragraph [0022] of the description specifies preferred carboxylic acids. However, the skilled person is not enabled to carry out the claimed method for these acids marked as preferred, as most of them are solid in the claimed temperature range of 0 to 40°C, and the description only discloses examples where acrylic acid is used at temperatures where it is in liquid form.

c) A comparison of examples 4 and 6 of the contested patent shows that the temperature of the aqueous sodium hydroxide and acrylic acid has a decisive influence on the peak temperature of the neutralization mixture and correlates with it. Nevertheless, there is a lack of information regarding suitable temperature ranges for acids other than acrylic acid. Furthermore, a comparison of examples 7 to 9 of the contested patent shows that the amount of acrylic acid and aqueous sodium hydroxide fed into the ring line also influences the peak temperature, namely, as shown in example 9, a peak temperature of below 70°C can only be achieved if, at a mixing ratio of 1:1 (ratio of fed products to products in the ring line), the temperature of the fed acrylic acid and fed aqueous sodium hydroxide is each 15°C. The appellant concluded, considering the above comparison of examples 4 and 6, that at a higher temperature of the fed substances, it is to be expected that the peak temperature would rise above 70°C, thus exceeding the value required in claim 1. On the other hand, it is also to be expected that by increasing the ratio of the amount of fed acrylic acid and aqueous sodium hydroxide to the solution already present in the ring line (""mixing ratio"" in column 2 of the table in paragraph [0098] of the contested patent) beyond a value of 1:1, for example, 2:1, the peak temperature would exceed 70°C. Since neither the mixing ratio of fed products (aqueous sodium hydroxide and acrylic acid) to the product present in the ring line, nor the temperature of the fed products are included in the claim, and the skilled person has no other sufficient information available to avoid exceeding this temperature across the entire claimed range using their general expertise, a lack of disclosure is to be noted.

d) Finally, the appellant argued that the decision of the opposition division was erroneous, as it relied at least in part on alleged effects of the molar ratio of acid to base, which was not presented as such by the opponent/appellant in the opposition proceedings. Rather, the mixing ratio, i.e., the ratio of the product stream in the ring line to the fed aqueous sodium hydroxide and acrylic acid, was the basis of the argumentation.

3.2 Taking into account the arguments of both parties, the Board holds the following view:

Claim 1 relates to a continuously conducted neutralization method. To be able to carry out the claimed method, the skilled person must be enabled to perform a method in which at least one ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid is at least partially neutralized with a base, and wherein, among other things, the temperature of the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid is from 0 to 40°C and the temperature of the neutralized solution is less than 70°C. The knowledge necessary for the skilled person must also be sufficient to carry out the method across the entire breadth of the claim without undue effort. To establish a lack of sufficiency of disclosure, serious doubts must exist that are substantiated by verifiable facts.

The description of the contested patent discloses examples showing that acrylic acid can be at least partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide in a continuous process, while maintaining the parameters regarding the temperature of the acid (from 0 to 40°C) and the temperature of the neutralized solution (less than 70°C) (see examples 2 and 4 to 6). Thus, at least one way to perform the method is clearly shown to the skilled person.

The appellant argued that the information available to the skilled person is not sufficient to carry out the method across the entire breadth of the claim without undue effort.

The Board considers this objection of the appellant to be insufficiently substantiated. Specifically, the following comments are made regarding the points raised above:

a) It is correct that the contested patent only provides examples where the temperature of acrylic acid and aqueous sodium hydroxide is 15 or 23°C (see the tables in paragraphs [0095] and [0098]). However, the Board is of the opinion that the appellant has not convincingly demonstrated why the skilled person could not choose other temperatures or use other acids defined in the claim. In particular, it was not explained what specific problems the skilled person would encounter in this regard, why the information available to them would be insufficient to solve such problems, and what additional information would be needed that is not available to them. It was also not shown that the use of other acids could not lead to a neutralization method in which the parameter ranges specified in claim 1 can be maintained. Regarding the required temperature distance, the appellant also did not demonstrate why this would be necessary for other acids.

b) The respondent explained that ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids can also be dosed in solid form below their melting point. In connection with acrylic acid, it was pointed out that it can also be dosed at temperatures below 15°C, for example, in the form of an 80 wt.% aqueous solution (see the response to the appeal, point 1, paragraph 3). Both appear credible to the Board and were not disputed by the appellant. Furthermore, the appellant did not demonstrate how the skilled person could not add ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids in solid form.

c) The respondent argued that the skilled person would refer to the information in paragraph [0043] of the patent to avoid a peak temperature of over 70°C and would, for example, increase the recirculation. Here too, the appellant did not present verifiable facts showing that the skilled person could not carry out the claimed method, but merely expressed assumptions.

d) The Board is of the opinion that the term ""mixing ratio"" in the table in paragraph [0098] of the description of the contested patent refers to the mass ratio of the reactants (in examples 7 to 9, aqueous sodium hydroxide and acrylic acid) fed through the feeds Z1 and Z2 to the mass flow already present in the ring line R (see also paragraph [0092] of the description of the contested patent).

3.3 Therefore, the Board concludes that the claimed method in the patent is disclosed in such a clear and complete manner that the skilled person can carry it out without undue effort across the entire claimed breadth.

4. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

4.1 The appellant argued a lack of inventive step starting from document D1 (either alone or in combination with D5 or D2) or D9 (in combination with D1) as the closest prior art. Since the respondent has also presented arguments for both approaches, and the Board is of the opinion that the claimed method does not arise in an obvious manner from either D1 or D9, both approaches are addressed below.

4.2 D1 as the Closest Prior Art

4.2.1 Document D1 discloses a continuous method for the neutralization of acrylic acid with an aqueous solution of a basic alkali salt, wherein in a preferred embodiment, a portion of the formed alkali acrylate solution is recirculated (see page 6, line 30 to page 7, line 27 and example 1: page 28, particularly lines 28 to 33). In the neutralization reaction, acrylic acid separated in a distillation apparatus is directly absorbed from the gas phase into an aqueous solution of an alkali hydroxide (see page 4, lines 13 to 16 and claim 1).

4.2.2 The parties assessed differently which features distinguish the method according to the contested patent from the method disclosed in D1. There was agreement that the claimed temperature of the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid to be neutralized is from 0 to 40°C, but this feature is not disclosed in D1.

The appellant further argued that document D1 also discloses the claimed dosing sequence, namely that ""the recirculated neutralized solution is sequentially added to the neutralization with a base and ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid."" It referred specifically to the passage on page 7, lines 7 to 12 and page 6, lines 33 to 36.

The respondent interpreted the wording of the mentioned passages in such a way that the reference to the ""above-described quench liquid"" (page 7, lines 8 to 9) does not clearly refer to the ""further quench liquid"" mentioned in the preceding paragraph, which is recirculated according to a preferred embodiment of the disclosed teaching. Rather, the passage refers to the quench liquid described generally before, which does not necessarily have to be recirculated (page 6, lines 37 to 39). Thus, in D1, a partial recirculation of the neutralized solution is not clearly disclosed in combination with the claimed dosing sequence.

The Board considers it not decisive for the present decision whether the feature of the claimed dosing sequence is clearly disclosed in document D1 in connection with a recirculation of the neutralized alkali acrylate solution, since the presence of an inventive step starting from D1 as the closest prior art can also be recognized solely based on the distinguishing feature of the temperature of the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid.

4.2.3 The appellant was unable to identify a technical advantage resulting from the distinguishing feature ""temperature of the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid from 0 to 40°C."" The respondent has already conceded during the written proceedings that no advantage has been shown for this feature (see letter of August 4, 2020, page 2, paragraph 4).

The technical problem to be solved can therefore be seen in providing an alternative method to D1.

4.2.4 The question of whether the skilled person would derive guidance from the method disclosed in D1 to provide the claimed alternative, wherein the temperature of the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid is from 0 to 40°C, was answered differently by the parties.

4.2.5 The appellant argued that the skilled person would reduce the temperature of the acrylic acid used in D1 to a temperature within the claimed range before neutralization, since neutralization reactions are exothermic and cooling of the system would therefore be desirable. This would lead to a more stable temperature profile and reduced temperature maxima. Additionally, by shifting the neutralization reaction disclosed in D1 into the liquid phase, the hazardous use of acid at very high temperatures could be reduced. The avoidance of temperature peaks, as described in the contested patent, is thus merely an effect that is inherently associated with the application of known process steps.

Furthermore, the disclosures of documents D5 and D2 would also prompt the skilled person to modify the method known from D1 in the claimed manner.

In document D5, it is stated that freshly distilled acrylic acid should preferably be stored at the lowest possible temperature, preferably between the solidification point and 25°C, before being neutralized or further processed (page 7, lines 18 to 20). Neutralization should also be carried out at low temperature (page 7, line 21). Thus, the skilled person is aware that acrylic acid does not have to be used directly from the gas phase. Moreover, it is known to them that it is possible and even preferred to carry out the neutralization process at low temperature, with the temperature of the acrylic acid being between the solidification point and 40°C.

From document D2, the skilled person also learns that it is possible to carry out the neutralization of acrylic acid with a base in a temperature range of 20 to 50°C, preferably 40°C (page 4, lines 33 to 36, claims 4 and 6, as well as examples 2, 3, and 4). Document D2 implicitly discloses that the acrylic acid used in the neutralization is at room temperature.

4.2.6 The respondent argued that the skilled person would always obtain a method from D1 in which distillatively separated acrylic acid is neutralized in gaseous form, as this is essential for the invention disclosed in D1. If they then wanted to modify the method so that acrylic acid is absorbed in sodium hydroxide at a temperature of 0 to 40°C, they would have to reduce the pressure in the distillation apparatus significantly, namely to well below the range of 50 to 120 mbar proposed in D1 (page 23, lines 29 and 30). However, this would no longer allow for controllable condensation. They would also avoid this approach because it carries the risk that the water present in the quench circuit would also start to boil. This would be associated with cooling problems. Furthermore, undefined conditions would arise in the plant.

4.2.7 The Board finds the argumentation of the appellant unconvincing.

Document D1 alone does not provide the skilled person with any indication to operate outside the proposed ranges of pressure (50 to 120 mbar, 78 mbar in the example) and temperature (65 to 130°C, preferably 70 to 100°C, 72°C in the example) (page 23, lines 29 to 30 and page 28, lines 24 to 26). They would choose these so that acrylic acid is in gaseous form (page 4, lines 13 to 16 and claim 1). The respondent has already pointed out, in a letter dated August 4, 2020, and again during the oral proceedings, that the pressure during the distillation of acrylic acid would have to be reduced to at least 14.4 mbar for it to be distilled at a temperature of 0 to 40°C. Both values lie outside the ranges mentioned in D1.

However, the skilled person is aware from the prior art of methods in which acrylic acid is neutralized in liquid form by alkaline solutions, and the temperature of the neutralized acrylic solution should be maintained within the claimed range (D2: page 4, lines 33 to 34 and example 1, page 6, lines 47 to 56; D9: example 1, page 10, lines 21 to 24). The skilled person also learns from the prior art that freshly distilled acrylic acid can be stored, and that the storage temperature should be as low as possible (D5: page 7, lines 18 to 20).

Thus, the only question is whether the skilled person would use this information to modify the method disclosed in D1 in the claimed manner.

The Board is of the opinion that this would not be the case without prior knowledge of the claimed invention. First, it should be noted that it is essential for the method disclosed in D1 that acrylic acid is neutralized in gaseous form, i.e., without intermediate condensation (see page 4, lines 13 to 16 and claim 1). Thus, it would be expected that the skilled person, in providing an alternative, would change the reaction conditions explicitly disclosed in the example, but would still operate within a framework that still allows for the neutralization of acrylic acid in gaseous form. In this regard, the Board finds the argumentation of the respondent convincing, that for this purpose, for example, the pressure within the plant would have to be reduced to a value that is significantly below the range mentioned in D1, and that this would be associated with complications, such as increased evaporation of water from the quench circuit and associated cooling problems. It cannot be assumed that the skilled person would take this risk to provide an alternative.

4.2.8 Thus, the Board concludes that the subject matter of claim 1 based on D1 as the closest prior art involves an inventive step.

4.3 D9 as the Closest Prior Art

4.3.1 Document D9 also describes a neutralization method of acrylic acid with sodium hydroxide. The method leads to a partially neutralized, supersaturated aqueous solution of sodium acrylate and acrylic acid, wherein the sodium acrylate partially precipitates (page 3, line 35 to page 6, line 14 and example 1, page 10, lines 21 to 27). The partial recirculation of the neutralized solution into the neutralization is not disclosed in D9. This was undisputed between the parties.

4.3.2 The appellant argued that document D9 discloses a method in which the claimed dosing sequence of base and acid is specifically described. As the only relevant distinguishing feature of the claimed neutralization method compared to D9, it identified the partial recirculation of the cooled neutralized solution, and defined the technical problem as providing an improved continuous neutralization method. However, this problem is merely solved in an obvious manner, as the skilled person would know the mentioned distinguishing feature from document D1 in connection with improved cooling and would therefore incorporate it into the method disclosed in D9 to solve the technical problem.

4.3.3 The respondent argued that document D9 discloses the use of supersaturated (meth)acrylic acid salt solutions, but not a method comprehensively involving the recirculation of supersaturated solution obtained by neutralizing acrylic acid with sodium hydroxide. The supersaturated solution produced according to D9 is also not suitable for recirculation, as salt can precipitate at any time. The teaching of D9 therefore leads away from the claimed subject matter.

4.3.4 The Board is of the opinion that the subject matter of the contested patent does not arise in an obvious manner from the technical teaching of document D9 for the following reasons.

4.3.4.1 Distinguishing Feature

Document D9 discloses a continuously conducted production of sodium acrylate as a preferred embodiment (page 6, lines 1 to 5). However, the method can alternatively also be conducted only partially continuously (page 6, lines 7 to 14).

Document D9 also describes various variants of adding sodium hydroxide for producing the partially neutralized sodium acrylate solution. These are either (1) a method with two addition steps, in which aqueous acrylic acid is first mixed with sodium hydroxide to produce 100 mol% neutralized sodium acrylate, and then further sodium hydroxide is added to over-neutralize it (page 4, lines 1 to 15), or (2) a method in which the excess sodium hydroxide is used from the beginning, i.e., in one process step (page 4, lines 17 to 20). In another variant (3), the acrylic acid solution is initially only partially neutralized, i.e., to less than 100%, and the excess sodium hydroxide solution is added after partial removal of the neutralization heat (page 4, lines 25 to 30). The addition of the excess sodium hydroxide can also occur partially before and partially after the heat exchanger; in variant (1), the sodium acrylate solution is either cooled during or after the neutralization (page 4, lines 5 to 7).

The variants thus differ in the initially set degree of neutralization and the timing of cooling. Common to the variants is that a solution is produced that is over-neutralized, in which sodium hydroxide has been supplied in excess to acrylic acid (page 4, lines 32 to 35). This is then in all variants subsequently mixed with excess acrylic acid to obtain a partially neutralized sodium acrylate solution (page 5, lines 9 to 17).

Only those of the described variants in which sodium hydroxide is added in two steps, namely variants (1) and (3), lead to a method in which the claimed dosing sequence is adhered to, as only in these variants is further base added after the (partial) neutralization before the excess acrylic acid is added in the next step (page 5, lines 9 to 13). This is not the case in the described variant (2). In variant (1), the timing of cooling must also be selected, as it must not occur during, but after the neutralization (page 4, lines 6).

This selection, however, does not yet lead the skilled person to the claimed subject matter. As the appellant pointed out, this differs from the disclosure of D9 also in that the neutralized solution is partially recirculated into the neutralization.

To arrive at the subject matter of claim 1 of the contested patent, the skilled person must therefore select the process variant and possibly the timing of cooling to achieve the claimed dosing sequence. Furthermore, they must carry out the method such that the neutralized solution is partially recirculated.

4.3.4.2 Technical Effect and Technical Problem

The respondent referred during the proceedings to the effect caused by the claimed dosing sequence of reducing the peak temperature occurring due to the neutralization reaction. This is demonstrated in examples 1 to 6 of the description of the contested patent. Indeed, a comparison, particularly of examples 1 and 2, shows that the peak temperature when adding base before acid into the recirculated neutralized solution leads to a reduction in the peak temperature occurring. This is reduced from 64°C in example 1 to 47°C in example 2, where in example 1 acrylic acid is added before sodium hydroxide, and in example 2 the addition occurs in reverse order. This was not disputed by the appellant during the appeal proceedings.

Regardless of any additional technical effect caused by the distinguishing feature of recirculation, the technical problem can thus be seen in providing an improved neutralization method, wherein the improvement lies in a reduction of the peak temperature occurring in the neutralized solution.

4.3.4.3 Claimed Solution

According to the claim, a neutralization method is proposed in which the neutralized and cooled solution is at least partially recirculated into the neutralization, and the recirculated neutralized solution is sequentially added to the neutralization with a base and ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid.

As shown in the examples mentioned above, the problem posed can be considered solved.

4.3.4.4 Obviousness of the Solution

Document D9 points out that the removal of a large part or preferably all of the neutralization heat during the production of the over-neutralized sodium acrylate solution is a particular advantage of the method according to the invention, as high starting temperatures in subsequent polymerization significantly deteriorate product quality. In this context, D9 refers to the two-part production of partially neutralized sodium acrylate solution, namely first producing an over-neutralized solution followed by the addition of further acrylic acid (page 6, lines 16 to 33). No connection is made in D9 between a dosing sequence of acrylic acid and sodium hydroxide solution and the avoidance of high peak temperatures. Although the three variants (1) to (3) mentioned above are described for producing the over-neutralized sodium acrylate solution, none of them is given preference regarding occurring peak temperatures or high temperatures in general. Thus, the skilled person does not derive any hints from document D9 to select a specific dosing sequence (or variant) to avoid high peak temperatures. No hints can be derived in this regard from document D1 either. Although the appellant refers to the technical teaching of document D1 in connection with their argumentation regarding a lack of inventive step starting from D9, this is only in connection with the distinguishing feature of the partial recirculation of the neutralized sodium acrylate solution.

The respondent's argument that the skilled person would not consider recirculating the supersaturated solution produced according to D9, as salt could precipitate from this solution, was not contested by the appellant. The Board finds the argumentation plausible. The skilled person would not risk salt formation in the reaction circuit and would therefore not seek recirculation for the method of D9 as a solution to the posed problem.

4.3.5 Thus, the Board concludes that the method of claim 1 also involves an inventive step starting from D9 as the closest prior art.

4.4 Since the claimed subject matter is not suggested by either of the proposed documents D1 or D9, the requirements of Article 56 EPC are considered fulfilled.

5. Therefore, there are no reasons against the maintenance of the contested patent based on any of the arguments presented in the appeal proceedings.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",opposition rejected,opposition rejected,appeal dismissed,"Nippon Shokubai Co., Ltd.","Nippon Shokubai Co., Ltd. 1-1, Koraibashi 4-chome, Chuo-ku, Osaka-shi Osaka 541-0043 / JP","Bassil, Nicholas Charles, et al, et al Kilburn & Strode LLP Lacon London 84 Theobalds Road London WC1X 8NL / GB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The present appeal by the applicant (appellant) is directed against the decision of the examining division to refuse European patent application No. 11 784 604.8, filed as international patent application PCT/EP2011/005801.

II. The basis for the contested decision was a single request, the main request submitted during the oral proceedings in the examination procedure on January 18, 2016. This main request contained 16 claims. The independent claim read as follows:

""1. A method for producing directly compressible mannitol with a delta modification content of more than 90%, characterized in that

a) in a first step, an aqueous D-mannitol solution, spray gas, powdered delta-mannitol, and hot gas are combined as starting materials,

b) the resulting granular product falls into a fluidized or moving bed, is collected, fluidized, and further transported,

and subsequently

c) a portion of the formed product is controlled and returned to the process, optionally after prior grinding to a smaller particle size,

wherein the dust-like delta-mannitol that accumulates in the line (9A) of the apparatus is returned from the powder dosing unit as powdered delta-mannitol by controlling the rotational speed of the rotary valve (10 A) into the spray drying (step a)) via the fan (E), which serves both as a conveying means for the solid return and for grinding and crushing the solid into powder,

and

the air supplied to the apparatus is preheated to a temperature in the range of 45 - 120 °C and the amount of supplied fresh air is in the range of 1000 - 2000 m3/m2 per hour, resulting in an exhaust air temperature in the range of 30 - 50 °C,

with the provision that the dust fraction of delta-mannitol with an average particle size of less than 20 μm, in particular with an average particle size in the range of about 1 to 20 μm, preferably in the range of 3 to 15 μm, is returned from the product discharge zone of the processor to step a), thereby shifting the balance of the process towards the formation of delta-mannitol

and that after establishing the balance, a product with a delta-mannitol content of more than 95%, in particular more than 98% is obtained.""

III. In its decision, the examining division reached the following conclusions:

a) Claim 1 of this request does not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC because one of the introduced features was originally disclosed only in combination with other features, which were not included in the amended claim 1.

b) The present request meets the requirements of Articles 84, 83, and 54 EPC.

c) Starting from D1 or D2 as the closest prior art, the subject matter of claim 1 of the present request does not involve an inventive step.

IV. The appellant filed an appeal against this decision. With the statement of grounds of appeal, she submitted a new main request. This main request contained 18 claims. The content of independent claim 1, on which the present decision is based, is as follows:

V. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA 2020, the board explained, among other things, its preliminary assessment that claims 1, 5, and 7 of the present main request do not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

VI. In a letter dated April 22, 2021, the appellant informed that she would not attend the oral proceedings scheduled for June 30, 2021, and requested a decision based on the written proceedings.

VII. The oral proceedings were canceled.

VIII. The appellant requests that the contested decision be set aside and a patent be granted based on the amended request submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal.

IX. The relevant arguments of the appellant for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

The amended claim 1 is based on the original claim 1, with the features of the original dependent claims 2, 12, 13, and 16 additionally included. Due to the original dependency of these claims on each other, the corresponding subject matter was originally claimed. Furthermore, the original description describes the method implementation, in which at the beginning of the process a fluidized or moving bed was provided, which was composed of beta-mannitol, with no crystalline delta-mannitol present in the processor (see p.9, lines 6 to 34 and figure 3), and in which the balance in the apparatus for the formation of delta-mannitol was shifted by targeted adjustment of the material flows, including the air flows and other parameters. Therefore, the inclusion of the features of claim 13 was also supported by the original description.

Thus, the present claim 1 meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.","Reasons for the Decision

Main Request

1. Amendments - Article 123(2) EPC

1.1 The present claim 1 relates to a method for producing directly compressible mannitol with a delta modification content of more than 90% starting from beta-mannitol powder.

1.2 The appellant argues that the amended claim 1 is based on a combination of the original claims 1, 2, 12, 13, and 16 as well as on the original description (see page 9 and figure 3).

1.3 The Board is of the opinion that these original claims do not provide corresponding support for the present claim 1. The original independent claim 1 relates to a method for producing directly compressible mannitol with a delta modification content of more than 90% starting solely from delta-mannitol powder. The original claims 2, 12, and 16 also do not define a method starting from beta-mannitol powder. Although the original dependent claim 13 defines a method in which beta-mannitol powder was used to establish the fluidized bed, the dependency of original claim 13 on original claim 1 means that in step a) of the method, delta-mannitol powder is additionally used. Such a method (beta- and delta-mannitol powder in step a)) does not correspond to the method defined in the amended claim 1 (exclusively beta-mannitol powder in step a)). The combination with further features from dependent claims 2, 12, and 16 and from the description (specific process depending on delta-mannitol content in the fluidized bed) is also not disclosed directly and unambiguously in the original application.

1.4 Another basis for a method for producing directly compressible mannitol with a delta modification content of more than 90% starting from beta-mannitol powder can therefore only be found on pages 9-10 and 17 of the original description. Contrary to the appellant's opinion, the method defined there does not correspond to the method according to the present claim 1 for the following reasons:

a) In the method defined in the description, only powdered beta-mannitol is used to establish the fluidized bed, and no further powdered mannitol is added as a reactant (see page 9, lines 6-34). By returning the beta-mannitol powder at the beginning of the method, only beta-mannitol powder can thus be introduced into the spray drying unit. In contrast, the present claim 1 stipulates that in step b) ""an aqueous D-mannitol solution, spray gas, powdered mannitol, and hot gas are combined as reactants,"" meaning that any powdered mannitol can be added. This subject matter therefore seems to go beyond the content of the original application.

b) The method starting from beta-mannitol powder is disclosed in the original description (see page 9, lines 12-21) in combination with certain parameters of the start-up process (temperature in the processor, spray pressure, return of unground powder). Since these parameters are not included in the present claim 1, an impermissible extension results.

c) According to the present claim 1, the controlled return of a portion of the formed product is initiated only after a delta-mannitol content of significantly over 50%, preferably a content of 60-70%, has formed in the fluidized bed (step d) and ""subsequently"" step e)). This return occurs according to the claim by opening flap H and closing flap J. Such a feature cannot be derived from the original description. On original page 17, lines 22-25 (see also page 10, lines 3-6), it is actually disclosed that starting from a delta-mannitol content in the fluidized bed of significantly over 50%, the supply air of the grinding fan must be switched from dust-free to dust-laden by opening flap H and closing flap J. Even if this modification may influence the amount of returned product, it does not mean that the return of a portion of the product occurs only then. A return of the product already takes place earlier both before and after the grinding fan by adjusting the rotary valves 10A and 10B (see, for example, page 9, lines 18-20 and page 17, lines 17-22).

1.5 The present dependent claims 5 and 7 are based on the original claims 6 and 8 and relate, among other things, to the return of delta-mannitol in ""step a)"". As already mentioned, according to the original description (see page 9, lines 6-34), in the present amended method starting from beta-mannitol, no delta-mannitol is present in the initial spray drying step (which corresponds to step a) in the original claims). There therefore seems to be no basis for a method according to the present claim 1, in which delta-mannitol is also returned in the initial spray drying step.

1.6 The Board thus concludes that the present claims 1, 5, and 7 do not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",the application has been refused,the application has been refused,appeal dismissed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

II. As requested, the parties were summoned to an oral hearing. This took place in the presence of all parties on March 10, 2022, as a video conference. During the oral hearing before the Board, the patent proprietor withdrew their consent to the text of the contested patent in the granted version as well as their consent to the claims of all auxiliary requests.

1. According to Article 113(2) EPC, the EPO can only maintain a patent in the version approved by the patent holder. Such approval is not present when the patent holder - as occurred in the present oral proceedings - withdraws their consent to the granted version of the contested patent and to the claims of all auxiliary requests, without submitting a modified version. In this situation, a fundamental requirement for the maintenance of the patent is lacking, and the procedure must be concluded by revocation of the patent without further examination, in accordance with the established case law of the Boards of Appeal (cf.

I. The appeal is directed against the decision of the Opposition Division to revoke European Patent EP 2 178 495 under Article 101(2) and (3)(b) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the contested patent was challenged under Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC) and lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC), as well as under Article 100(b) EPC for insufficient disclosure (Article 83 EPC) and under Article 100(c) EPC for impermissible extension (Article 123(2) EPC).

III. In its decision, the Opposition Division concluded that the claims of the granted patent had not been impermissibly extended during the examination procedure (Article 123(2) EPC). However, the ground for opposition raised by the opponent regarding insufficient disclosure (Article 100(b) EPC) precluded the maintenance of the granted patent. Auxiliary requests 1 to 3 were also not allowable due to insufficient disclosure (Article 83 EPC). Auxiliary requests 4 and 6 violated the requirements of Article 123(3) EPC. Auxiliary requests 5 and 7 were withdrawn by the patent proprietor during the oral proceedings. The grounds for opposition raised under Article 100(a) EPC concerning lack of novelty and lack of inventive step were not decided in the opposition proceedings.

IV. The patent proprietor filed an appeal against this decision on December 20, 2016, which was substantiated on March 3, 2017. Four auxiliary requests were submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal.

V. The respondent (opponent) submitted arguments against the admissibility of auxiliary requests 2 to 4 in the appeal proceedings and against the allowability of all requests in letters dated July 27, 2017, and December 20, 2019.

VI. In a letter dated July 31, 2020, the parties were summoned to oral proceedings scheduled for February 15, 2021.

VII. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the parties were informed of the preliminary assessment of the Board. The Board was, among other things, provisionally of the opinion that the main request of the appellant met the requirements of both Article 123(2) EPC and Article 83 EPC.

The Board also informed the parties that, according to the requests of both parties, a remittal of the case to the Opposition Division for examination of further patentability criteria was to be expected.

VIII. Independent claim 1 of the patent in the granted version, on which the contested decision is based and which also underlies the present decision, reads as follows:

""Use of a means with a pH value of 1 to 5, comprising in a carrier a combination of active ingredients consisting of

(a) at least one organic compound of the formula (I)

HS-X-COOM (I)

wherein

X means a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, and aliphatic hydrocarbon framework, which may be substituted with at least one of the following groups: thiol group, carboxyl group, carboxylate group, hydroxy group, -NH2, (C1 to C6)-alkylamino, (C1 to C6)-dialkylamino, (C1 to C6)-hydroxyalkyl,

M stands for a hydrogen atom, a (C1 to C8)-alkyl group, or an equivalent of a monovalent or multivalent cation,

and

(b) at least one cyclic organic carbonate as an organic compound, for the reductive decolorization of keratin-containing fibers, in particular human hair.""

IX. In her statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

A basis for the amendments made during the examination procedure in claim 1 can be found in originally filed claims 1, 2, 9, and 13. This was also acknowledged by the Opposition Division. Therefore, the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC are fulfilled.

Regarding the requirements of Article 83 EPC, the appellant argued that there are neither facts nor evidence for the assertion that not all claimed combinations of components (a) and (b) lead to the inventive success, nor for the assertion that identifying effective combinations of components (a) and (b) would involve a significant effort for the skilled person. There are also no indications to assume that identifying effective combinations of components (a) and (b) would involve a considerable effort for the skilled person. The respondent merely expressed assumptions in this regard.

X. In her response to the statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the respondent essentially argued as follows:

Claim 1 of the granted patent has been impermissibly extended during the granting procedure (Article 123(2) EPC), as the features included in the amended claim 1 are disclosed in the originally filed claims, but their combination is not. The respondent referred to the selection of representatives of an organic compound listed under point (i) of originally filed claim 1 as ""cyclic organic carbonates,"" and their combination with the ""compound of formula (I)"" chosen as component (a) according to original claim 2, as well as the preferred range ""from pH 1 to pH 5"" specified in original claim 9.

Furthermore, the definitions of components (a) and (b) are so broad that the skilled person cannot determine which combinations actually fulfill the functionally defined feature of reductive decolorization. It is not credible that the use of all means contained in a carrier leads to reductive decolorization of keratin-containing fibers for each of the possible claimed combinations. The skilled person is not enabled to achieve the intended result of reductive decolorization of keratin-containing fibers across the entire breadth of the claim without undue effort; therefore, the requirements of Article 83 EPC are not fulfilled.

XI. Requests of the Parties

The appellant (patent proprietor) requested that the contested decision be overturned and that the patent be maintained in the granted version, or alternatively in the scope of the auxiliary requests 1 to 4 submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal.

The respondent (opponent) requested that the appeal be dismissed and the decision of the Opposition Division be upheld in its entirety, as well as that auxiliary requests 2 to 4 not be admitted into the proceedings.

Both parties requested that the case be remitted to the Opposition Division for further examination if the appeal is granted.

XII. An oral hearing took place on February 15, 2021, with the consent of both parties in the form of a video conference. At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Main Request - Amendments (Article 100(c) EPC)

2.1 The relevant claims 1, 2, 9, and 13 in their originally filed form read as follows (emphasis added by the Board):

1. Means for reductive decolorization of keratin-containing fibers, in particular human hair, comprising in a carrier a combination of active ingredients consisting of

(a) at least one organic compound carrying at least one thiol group and at least one optionally derivatized carboxyl group, and

(b) at least one organic compound selected from the group consisting of

(i) cyclic organic carbonates and

(ii) glycerin and its derivatives,

(iii) C4-C12 fatty acid dimethylamides.

2. Means according to claim 1, characterized in that component (a) is selected from at least one compound of the formula (I)

HS-X-COOM (I)

wherein

X means a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched aliphatic hydrocarbon framework, which may optionally be substituted with at least one of the following groups

- thiol group

- carboxyl group

- carboxylate group

- hydroxy group

- -NH2

- (C1 to C6)-alkylamino

- (C1 to C6)-dialkylamino

- (C1 to C6)-hydroxyalkyl

M stands for a hydrogen atom, a (C1 to C8)-alkyl group, or an equivalent of a monovalent or multivalent cation.

9. Means according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that it has a pH value of pH 1 to pH 9, in particular from pH 1 to pH 5, most preferably from pH 1 to pH 3.

13. Use of a means according to any of claims 1 to 12 for decolorizing keratin-containing fibers, in particular human hair.

2.2 It was undisputed between the parties that the features associated with each of the amendments are disclosed as such in the originally filed application documents. The Board also agrees that claim 1 of the main request contains only features that were already disclosed in the originally filed claims 1, 2, 9, and 13.

2.3 It was also undisputed between the parties that the use according to claim 1 was already disclosed by the originally filed claim 13 for all means disclosed in the application. The Board sees no impermissible extension in this modified wording of claim 1 in the sense of Article 123(2) EPC. In particular, claim 13 in its original form was directed to the use of a means according to any of the preceding claims, thus covering all means defined in these preceding claims 1 to 12.

2.4 However, the respondent argued that the features included in claim 1 from claims 2 (for the definition of component (a) of the originally filed claim 1) and 9 (for the range of pH 1 to pH 5), as well as particularly their combination with the choice of ""cyclic organic carbonates"" as the organic compound of component (b) of the means defined in claim 1, lead to an impermissible amendment.

2.5 The Board does not agree with this view for the following reasons:

2.5.1 The original claim 1 in conjunction with claim 13 was directed to the use of means that contain in a carrier a combination of active ingredients, which includes at least one of the organic compounds specified in claim 1 under (i) to (iii) as component (b) (see point 2.1 above).

2.5.2 To arrive at the amended subject matter, the skilled person must therefore first make a selection from three equally ranked options specified in the originally filed claim, namely the selection of ""(i) cyclic organic carbonates"" as component (b) of the active ingredient combination. However, the description only lists formulations that include the compound propylene carbonate, which falls under the selection made (see formulations E1 to E3 in Table 1 on page 73 of the originally filed description). The skilled person would understand this as an indication that variant (i) is the preferred organic compound (b).

2.5.3 In the amended claim 1, the component (a) of the means is further specified by incorporating the wording of the original claim 2. The complete wording was integrated into the amended claim 1. Since the original claim 2 was formulated as dependent on claim 1, it already included the combination of all features of claims 1 and 2. Therefore, this amendment is merely a rephrasing of the wording of the original claim 2 in conjunction with the selection made according to point 2.5.2.

2.5.4 Similarly, the inclusion of the feature ""having a pH value of 1 to 5"" is addressed. The original claim 9 specified further ranges for the pH value (see point 2.1 above). However, these are not multiple equally ranked alternatives, but rather the pH value range is specified stepwise. Since the original claim 9 was again formulated as dependent on all preceding claims 1 to 8, and thus already contained the combination with the features of these preceding claims, the inclusion of this feature in claim 1 is also merely a rephrasing of an already originally disclosed feature combination.

2.6 Thus, the feature combination of the amended claim 1 arises directly from claim 13, incorporating the pH-related feature from claim 9, the features of claim 2, and a single selection to be made from the originally filed claim 1. This selection is to be regarded as preferred based on the examples disclosed in the description. The Board therefore holds the view that the skilled person is not confronted with technical information through the amendments that they could not already directly and unambiguously derive from the originally filed application documents.

2.7 The respondent referred in their argumentation to decisions T 1799/12, T 407/10, and T 686/99. Even considering the respective circumstances, the Board does not change its assessment for the following reasons:

2.7.1 In the case T 1799/12 (see in particular point 2.8 of the reasons for the decision), a specific packaging form was selected from a range of possible embodiments and included in the independent claim. According to the competent Board, there were clear indications in the description of the contested patent that a packaging according to the invention should not preferably be in the selected form. Thus, there was not only no indication in the description in favor of the selected feature, but rather an indication to choose another packaging form. This is not the case here (see point 2.5.2 above).

2.7.2 In the case underlying decision T 407/10, the competent Board held that features were included in the independent claim that or their combination with other features were not indicated as preferred in the description of the contested patent (see in particular points 2.1.4 and 3.2 of the reasons for the decision). This does not apply to the present case either.

2.7.3 In the case T 0686/99 (see in particular point 4.3.3 of the reasons for the decision), the competent Board found that an amendment was made by multiple selections from two lists of alternative features. However, this reasoning cannot be applied to the present case, as neither was a selection made from two lists, nor from purely alternative features (see points 2.5.2 and 2.5.4 above).

2.8 The Board therefore concludes, in agreement with the opposition division, that the subject matter of claim 1 according to the main request was not impermissibly extended during the examination procedure and thus meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. The ground for opposition under Article 100(c) EPC is therefore not decisive.

3. Main Request - Sufficiency of Disclosure (Article 100(b) EPC)

3.1 The opposition division had essentially justified the revocation of the patent due to lack of sufficiency of disclosure by stating that the definition of components (a) and (b) in the claims went clearly beyond what was shown by the examples. Therefore, the skilled person could only determine which of the many possible combinations could lead to success through trial and error. Regarding the burden of proof, the opposition division stated that a reworking of certain claimed embodiments by the opponent/respondent could not be carried out without the inclusion of a research program due to the breadth of the definitions of components (a) and (b) in the claim.

3.2 The respondent essentially followed the argumentation of the opposition division. The appellant opposed this assessment.

3.3 The Board finds the arguments of the appellant convincing for the following reasons:

3.3.1 Claim 1 of the contested patent relates to the use of a means with a pH value of 1 to 5 for the reductive decolorization of keratin-containing fibers, in particular human hair. The means is characterized in that it contains in a carrier a combination of active ingredients consisting of (a) at least one organic compound of formula (I), and (b) at least one cyclic organic carbonate as the organic compound. The variables ""X"" and ""M"" of the compound of formula (I) are defined in the claim. The claim does not require that a certain degree of decolorization must be achieved.

3.3.2 To carry out the claimed use, the skilled person must be able to provide a means defined in the claim using the information provided in the patent, with the aid of their general technical knowledge, and achieve a reductive decolorization of keratin-containing fibers with it. The knowledge necessary for the skilled person must also be sufficient to rework the use across the entire breadth of the claim without unreasonable effort. To establish a lack of sufficiency of disclosure, serious doubts must exist that are substantiated by verifiable facts.

3.3.3 The description of the contested patent describes the preparation of formulations that apparently include means containing in a carrier a combination of active ingredients defined in the claims (Table 1: Formulations E1, E2, and E3). The use of one of these means (E1) for decolorizing keratin-containing fibers is also described (paragraphs [0198] to [0202] and Table 2). The skilled person can thus derive at least one example from the patent document on how the claimed subject matter can be executed.

3.3.4 It was disputed between the parties whether the skilled person is enabled to rework essentially all embodiments falling within the scope of the claims.

3.3.5 In this regard, the respondent claimed that the definitions of components (a) and (b) are so broad that the skilled person cannot determine which combinations actually fulfill the functionally defined feature of reductive decolorization of keratin-containing fibers. It is not credible that this effect occurs using all means defined in the claims. In particular, the two components (a) and (b) are indeterminate regarding their molecular size, and component (b) additionally regarding possible additional substituents that could also cause oxidations. The skilled person would therefore not be able to achieve the intended result of reductive decolorization of keratin-containing fibers across the entire breadth of the claim without unreasonable effort.

3.3.6 The components (a) and (b) are defined in claim 1 particularly by the mandatory presence of specific functional groups, namely a thiol group in formula (I) of component (a), as well as a cyclic carbonate as component (b). Furthermore, the possible substituents of the hydrocarbon framework ""X"" are also limited to certain functional groups. The Board cannot follow the respondent's argument that components (a) and (b) are defined disproportionately broadly. The respondent has also not provided specific information or evidence as to which combinations of the claimed components (a) and (b) are unsuitable for reductive decolorization of keratin-containing fibers. In contrast, the patent document contains information on which components (a) or (b) the skilled person can select and in what amounts these should be contained in the means to be used. In particular, paragraphs [0017] to [0033] of the contested patent show the skilled person options for the group ""X"", including their preferred substituents, and the group ""M"" of compounds of formula (I) as component (a), as well as for component (b) of the mixture. The respondent has also left open how the skilled person would not utilize this information to develop further examples.

3.3.7 Even if the definitions of components (a) and (b) were to include compounds that are not suitable for the stated purpose, as claimed by the respondent with reference to potentially oxidizing substituents of component (b), it seems questionable to the Board whether the skilled person in the field of hair care products would even consider such compounds for the intended purpose, especially since suggestions are already made in the description of the contested patent regarding which components they can use. If they were to attempt this and thus fail to achieve reductive decolorization of keratin-containing fibers, it can be assumed that they would utilize the information contained in the description of the contested patent regarding the preferred compounds of components (a) and (b) to arrive at means that can achieve the desired effect.

3.3.8 No arguments were presented regarding how the procurement of substances falling under the definitions of (a) and (b), the manufacture of carriers containing these, or the investigation of whether a means with a pH value of 1 to 5 containing this combination of active ingredients in a carrier leads to reductive decolorization of keratin-containing fibers should represent an unreasonable effort.

3.3.9 Likewise, the respondent made no attempt to show that certain claimed embodiments, based on specific combinations of representatives of groups (a) and (b), cannot be produced or do not lead to the claimed reductive decolorization of keratin-containing fibers. The assertion that the skilled person must conduct their own experiments seems correct to the Board; however, it does not see this as associated with unreasonable effort, particularly not in light of the information contained in the patent document regarding the nature of the active ingredients (a) and (b) as well as the conduct of experiments for reductive decolorization of keratin-containing fibers (see point 3.3.6 above). The Board therefore does not consider the conduct of such experiments to be equivalent to the inclusion of a research program.

3.4 The Board is therefore of the opinion that the arguments presented by the respondent do not convincingly demonstrate that the skilled person cannot rework the claimed subject matter essentially across the entire breadth. The requirements of Article 83 EPC are thus fulfilled.

4. Remittal (Article 111 EPC)

In the opposition proceedings, the patent was also challenged under Article 100(a) EPC. The reasons presented by the opponent/respondent in the opposition proceedings regarding this were not addressed in the opposition decision. According to the minutes of the oral proceedings before the opposition division, the grounds for opposition of lack of novelty and lack of inventive step were also not the subject of the oral proceedings. In the opinion of the Board, this is a special reason according to Article 11 RPBA that justifies a remittal.

Both parties have conditionally requested remittal to the opposition division in case the appeal is granted. The Board follows these requests.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1.

I. The appeal of the applicant (hereinafter referred to as the ""appellant"") is directed against the decision of the examining division to refuse European patent application No. 04 765 528.7.

II. With her statement of appeal, the appellant submitted a new main request and auxiliary requests 1 and 2, and requested that the decision be overturned and a patent be granted based on these requests.

III. In its communication pursuant to Article 15(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal 2007, the Board set out its objections, which were provisionally held under Articles 84, 123(2), 54, and 56 EPC against the patentability of the current claims.

IV. In a letter dated February 10, 2020, the appellant informed that she would not attend the oral proceedings and requested a decision based on the written record.

V. The oral proceedings took place on February 19, 2020, in the absence of the appellant.

VI. Claims 1, 4, 6, and 7 according to the main request have the following wording:

Claim 1 according to auxiliary request 1 differs from that according to the main request in that the yield point of the claimed preparations is chosen in the range of ""0.5-20 Pa.""

Claim 1 according to auxiliary request 2 differs from that according to auxiliary request 1 in that ""the quotient of the loss modulus and the storage modulus tan delta of the preparations is chosen from the range of 0.05-6.""","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appellant has not addressed the deficiencies identified in the communication from the Board and has requested a decision based on the state of the file. Therefore, the Board sees no reason to deviate from its preliminary opinion that the claimed subject matter does not meet, among other things, the requirements of Articles 84 (Clarity) and 123(2) EPC.

2. Main Request

The new main request corresponds to that submitted during the oral proceedings before the examining division, with the exception that component (d) has been amended, or new claims 5 to 7 have been added.

2.1 Clarity (Article 84 EPC)

2.1.1 Claim 1 according to the main request lists as component a) anionic surfactants selected from a group consisting of disodium acyl glutamate and other specific acyl glutamates also belonging to the class of disodium acyl glutamates (disodium lauroyl glutamate, etc.). It is therefore unclear whether component a) includes any disodium acyl glutamate or only the specifically listed acyl glutamates.

2.1.2 According to claim 1, component d) is selected from the class of ethoxylated mono-, di-, and triglycerides of oleic acid with an average degree of ethoxylation of 3-20 ethylene oxide units. However, dependent claim 4 lists as component d) other classes of ethoxylated glycerides, thus contradicting the wording of claim 1. It is therefore unclear whether claim 1 also includes these ethoxylated glycerides listed as component d) in claim 4.

2.1.3 Claims 1 and 4 do not therefore meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC (Clarity).

2.2 Article 123(2) EPC

2.2.1 According to claim 7, the quotient of the loss modulus and the storage modulus tan delta of the claimed preparations must be chosen in the range of 0.05 to 6.

2.2.2 However, this range is specified in the original disclosure (see page 12, lines 7-8) as ""0.05 to 0.6"" and thus claim 7 refers instead to a broader range not disclosed in the original application.

2.2.3 Therefore, this amendment does not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

3. Auxiliary Request 1

Claim 1 according to this request differs from that according to the main request only in that the yield point of the claimed preparations is chosen in the range of 0.5-20 Pa, and is thus identical to claim 6 according to the main request. However, this amendment is not suitable to remedy the aforementioned deficiencies under Articles 84 and 123(2) EPC.

4. Auxiliary Request 2

Claim 1 according to this request differs from that according to Auxiliary Request 1 in that the quotient of the loss modulus and the storage modulus tan delta of the preparations is chosen from the range of 0.05-6. Thus, the feature of claim 7 according to the main request has been incorporated into the wording of the current claim 1. However, this amendment is also not suitable to remedy the aforementioned deficiencies under Articles 84 and 123(2) EPC.

5. The Board therefore concludes that all requests do not meet the requirements of the EPC for the aforementioned reasons and must be rejected.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",the application has been refused,the application has been refused,appeal dismissed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeal of the opponent concerns the interim decision of the opposition division, posted on December 15, 2016, regarding the maintenance of European Patent No. 2 300 060 in amended form based on the main request submitted during the oral proceedings on November 23, 2016.

II. Claim 1 of the main request had the following wording:

""Method for producing water-absorbent polymer particles by polymerization

of a monomer solution, comprising

a) at least one ethylenically unsaturated, acid group-containing monomer,

b) at least one crosslinker,

c) at least one initiator,

d) optionally one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers that can be copolymerized with the monomers mentioned under a), and

e) optionally one or more water-soluble polymers,

wherein the monomer a) is at least partially neutralized and the heat of neutralization is at least partially removed by means of an indirect heat exchanger using a cooling medium, characterized in that the temperature of the monomer a) supplied for neutralization is between 15 and 40°C, the monomer a) is acrylic acid, and the specific cooling capacity of the heat exchanger is less than 5 W/cm**(2).""

III. An opposition was filed against the granted patent based on the grounds under Article 100(a) EPC (lack of novelty, lack of inventive step) and Article 100(b) EPC.

This decision refers to the following documents:

D2: WO-A-2007/028751

D19: US-A-2008/114140

Experimental report of the applicant dated January 18, 2012 (submitted during the examination procedure with letter dated January 20, 2012).

IV. According to the decision, the subject matter of the request submitted during the oral proceedings meets the requirements of Articles 54, 83, and 123(2) and (3) EPC. The requirements of Article 56 EPC were also considered to be fulfilled.

V. The opponent (appellant) filed an appeal against the decision.

The appeal was based solely on the ground of lack of inventive step.

VI. The patent proprietor (respondent) responded to the appeal.

VII. The board issued a summons for oral proceedings and a communication.

VIII. In a letter dated May 20, 2020, the appellant informed that they would not participate in the oral proceedings.

IX. The oral proceedings took place on May 29, 2020, without the participation of the appellant.

X. The arguments of the appellant regarding inventive step can be summarized as follows:

a) The closest prior art is D2.

This relates to the same problem as the patent, namely the avoidance of premature polymerization, which can occur as a result of hot monomer solution leading to the formation of deposits. Furthermore, D2 and the patent use the same solution, namely control of the temperature profile.

b) The subject matter of claim 1 differs from D2 in that the cooling capacity of the heat exchanger is specified. Although this is not stated in D2, it should be considered as inherently disclosed.

c) D2 does not contain a detailed description of the heat exchanger. However, D2 (examples) as well as the contested patent (paragraph 108) specify very similar temperature differences (cooling). Thus, it is evident that the respective heat exchangers must be very similar, if not identical. Therefore, the specification of the cooling capacity to achieve the same results as in D2 cannot justify inventive step.

d) The experiments submitted by the respondent during the examination procedure merely demonstrate the relevance of the cooling capacity defined in the claims under the specific conditions of these experiments. However, they do not show that the defined capacity is of general significance or relevance.

e) Furthermore, the specification of only the cooling capacity does not allow conclusions to be drawn about the resulting cooling rate. This rather depends on the design of the heat exchanger.

Thus, the specification of the cooling capacity without further features regarding the heat exchanger is of little significance or informative value, and inventive step cannot be recognized.

XI. The arguments of the respondent regarding inventive step can be summarized as follows:

a) It is not disputed that D2 represents the closest prior art.

b) It is also not disputed that the subject matter of claim 1 differs from the disclosure of D2 by the specified cooling capacity of the heat exchanger.

c) D2 only concerns simulations. No concrete examples are disclosed. The aim of D2 is to avoid temperature peaks during the neutralization of acrylic acid. For the purpose of the simulations in D2, it was not necessary to simulate the heat exchanger.

Therefore, the appellant's argument that D2 involves a similar heat exchanger to that defined in claim 1 is irrelevant.

The examples of the patent, and in particular the examples submitted during the examination procedure, demonstrate that the specified cooling capacity allows for the avoidance of deposits. Thus, it is proven that the objective defined in paragraph 12 of the patent has been achieved.

d) D2 teaches that the heat of neutralization can lead to undesirable polymerization and therefore requires that it be removed as quickly as possible to avoid such undesirable polymerizations (page 3, lines 33 to 35; page 6, lines 20 to 22). Rapid removal of heat requires a high cooling capacity. Thus, D2 would lead away from the invention with the defined low cooling capacity.

It is surprising that the problem of precipitation of the acrylate salt occurs before reaching the solubility limit, as shown in the submitted examples and discussed in paragraph 111 of the patent. This very aspect is not recognized in D2.

The appellant's assumption that the liquid to be cooled is colder at the inner wall of the pipe than in the interior of the pipe, leading to deposits, is incorrect, as heat exchangers are always operated with turbulent flow to ensure optimal heat exchange.

With higher cooling capacity, cooling occurs more quickly. However, it is important to prevent a certain area from dissipating too much heat. If this happens, the stated problems will occur. It is essential that the respective inlet and outlet temperatures are defined. The required cooling capacity can be calculated in this context.

The residence time and internal volume of the heat exchanger are related to the number of tubes. Thus, with a higher number of tubes at the same total cooling capacity, cooling will take longer than with a smaller number of tubes.

e) D19 describes a supersaturated solution of Na-acrylate. In its example 1, neutralization was carried out under cooling. The precipitating Na-acrylate floats on the liquid surface. This would not be possible if it were to precipitate at the cooling surface. Consequently, D19 shows that precipitation at supersaturation does not occur at a cold surface. D19 also does not contain any information on specific cooling capacity and concerns discontinuous laboratory experiments.

f) Therefore, inventive step should be recognized.

XII. The appellant requested in the written procedure the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

XIII. The respondent requested the dismissal of the appeal.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Inventive Step

1.1 It is undisputed that D2 represents the closest prior art.

D2 relates to a neutralization process for acrylic acid (claims 1 and 11) aimed at preventing temperature peaks to avoid premature polymerization (page 3, lines 30 to 38). The neutralized acrylic acid is then polymerized to produce water-absorbent polymers (page 1, line 16 to page 2, line 12; page 3, lines 16 to 23). However, no real experiments are conducted; instead, simulations/calculations are performed. This fact is illustrated by the ""examples."" The first sentence of the section ""Examples 1 to 6"" on page 16, starting from line 35, reads:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHICFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

Regarding the heat exchangers to be used, it is stated on page 6, lines 16 and 17 of D2 that they ""are not subject to any restrictions."" Consequently, D2 does not further address details of the heat exchanger.

1.2 It is equally undisputed that the subject matter of claim 1 differs from this teaching only by the specified cooling capacity of the heat exchanger.

1.3 A technical effect arising from this feature has not been demonstrated.

The patent does not contain suitable examples.

The experimental data submitted during the examination procedure (test report under point III., above) are also unsuitable to demonstrate a technical effect:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

In these experiments, not only the distinguishing feature (cooling capacity) is varied, but also the temperature gradient DeltaT.

These experiments at most show that excessive cooling (to too low a temperature) leads to precipitation.

Contrary to the statement of the respondent in the first paragraph of page 2 of the response to the appeal:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

an effect arising from the performance of the heat exchanger is not demonstrated.

1.4 Objective Problem to be Solved

Thus, the objective problem to be solved can only be formulated as the implementation of the theoretical process according to D2 into practice.

1.5 The Solution

This problem was solved by specifying a cooling capacity for the heat exchanger.

1.6 Obviousness

To solve the problem defined under 1.4, it is unavoidable to use a real heat exchanger. This must necessarily have a cooling capacity or be operated with a cooling capacity. The specification of this parameter with any value is therefore an obvious - indeed necessary - solution to the above-defined objective problem.

In this context, the argument of the respondent that it is surprising that the problem of precipitation of the acrylate salt occurs even before reaching the solubility limit is irrelevant for the assessment of inventive step, as the claim does not contain a feature for which it has been demonstrated that this circumstance is taken into account or countered.

1.7 Further Aspects

1.7.1 D19

Regarding D19, the respondent argued that it would show that no deposits occur on cold surfaces in the case of supersaturation. Thus, the problem of the patent or its solution cannot be derived from D19.

However, it should be noted that the experimental setup in D19 is completely different from that of the method according to the contested patent or D2.

D19 pertains to an experiment on a laboratory scale, which is carried out in a laboratory reactor under strong stirring according to its example 1. A continuous system with the flow of a solution through pipelines as described in the patent (see paragraph 41 and figure 1 of the patent) does not occur in D19.

Thus, D19 is not relevant to the claimed method.

1.7.2 Characteristics of the Heat Exchanger

In light of the parties' arguments, an additional question could arise as to whether the cooling capacity with which the heat exchanger is operated is the only essential feature of the heat exchanger. It has been stated both by the appellant (appeal statement 2.11) and by the respondent (response to the appeal, page 2, 6th paragraph) and during the oral proceedings that problems would arise if too much heat is removed through a certain area.

Thus, the question arises whether the design features of the heat exchanger (configuration, number and size of the tubes, etc.) are also relevant for achieving the claimed effect, particularly the prevention of deposits.

In view of the above, this aspect does not need to be conclusively addressed.

1.8 For these reasons, the method of claim 1 of the sole request does not involve an inventive step.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2.

I. The appeals of the patent holder and the two opponents are directed against the decision of the opposition division to maintain European Patent EP 2 096 102 in amended form in accordance with Article 101(3)(a) EPC.

II. The patent relates to a multi-stage integrated process for the production of methylene diphenyl isocyanates, in which saline wastewater from the first process stage of an electrolysis is fed in to use the chlorine obtained from it as a reactant in the further course of the process.

The independent claim of the patent reads:

""Process for the production of methylene diphenyl diisocyanates, comprising at least the steps

A1) Reacting aniline with formaldehyde in the presence of hydrochloric acid to form a reaction mixture containing di- and polyamines of the diphenylmethane series (""MDA""), optionally at least partially removing the water introduced with the reactants or formed during the reaction from the reaction mixture,

A2) Neutralizing the reaction mixture formed in step A1) with an aqueous alkali hydroxide solution, resulting in an aqueous alkali chloride-containing solution and an organic phase containing the mixture of di- and polyamines,

A3) Separating the organic phase from step A2) from the aqueous phase and processing the organic phase to obtain the mixture of di- and polyamines of the diphenylmethane series,

A4) Adjusting the remaining aqueous alkali chloride-containing solution from step A3) to a pH < 8, purifying the alkali chloride-containing solution so that it has a TOC value < 200 ppm, preferably < 50 ppm, more preferably < 20 ppm, wherein the alkali chloride-containing solution is optionally at least partially combined with the aqueous phases removed from the reaction mixture in step A1) and/or arising during the processing of the organic phase in accordance with step A3),

B) Reacting the mixture of di- and polyamines of the diphenylmethane series obtained in step A3) with phosgene to form a mixture of di- and polyisocyanates of the diphenylmethane series (MDI) and hydrogen chloride,

characterized in that

C) the purified alkali chloride-containing solution obtained in step A4) is at least partially subjected to electrochemical oxidation to produce chlorine, alkali lye, and optionally hydrogen, and

D) at least a portion of the chlorine produced in step C) is used for the production of the phosgene used in step B).""

III. In the course of the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged under Articles 100(a), (b), and (c) EPC for lack of novelty, lack of inventive step, lack of enablement, and impermissible amendments.

In its decision, the opposition division concluded that the invention was enabled for the skilled person (Article 83 EPC) and that novelty was given (Article 54 EPC). The ground for opposition of impermissible amendments under Article 100(c) EPC was rejected for lack of sufficient substantiation. However, the subject matter of the claims of the granted patent was not considered inventive starting from D1 as the closest prior art in combination with D4. In contrast, the auxiliary request II presented in the opposition proceedings, which was indicated by the patent holder as the highest-ranking auxiliary request, met the requirements of the EPC.

All parties appealed against this decision.

IV. During the proceedings, the following documents were cited, among others:

D1: |CN101020642A, translated into English |

D2: |Smith, Ronald M., ""Isocyanates"", SRI International, August 1992 (excerpts) |

V. The patent holder requested that the contested decision be overturned and the oppositions be rejected. In her appeal statement and in the further proceedings, she essentially argued as follows:

The decision of the opposition division was correct insofar as it concerned the issues of enablement and novelty. It was also rightly determined that the process according to auxiliary request II was based on inventive step starting from D1. However, the process defined in the claims of the contested patent also relied on inventive step. In particular, starting from D1, the claimed purification of the saline wastewater prior to electrolysis was not suggested by the prior art. Regarding the auxiliary request, the opposition division rightly concluded that the claimed degree of protonation in combination with the use of electrolysis membranes with increased water permeability was not suggested by the prior art.

VI. The opponents requested that the contested decision be overturned and the patent be revoked. They argued in their appeal statement and in the further proceedings essentially as follows:

The process defined in the claims of the granted patent was rightly denied inventive step by the opposition division. Starting from D1, the purification of the saline wastewater prior to electrolysis was known to the skilled person from their general technical knowledge. This is documented in D15 and D28; D3 and D4 also provide the skilled person with corresponding indications. Furthermore, the process was not described in an enabling manner and was not even novel compared to D1. The process claimed in the auxiliary request was equally non-inventive starting from D1 as that of the granted patent, as the additional features could not contribute an inventive step. In particular, the claimed degree of protonation and the use of electrolysis membranes with increased water permeability do not work synergistically together, and each of the two features is suggested by the prior art on its own.

VII. By summons dated May 20, 2020, an oral hearing was scheduled for January 14, 2021. The date of the hearing was subsequently postponed to November 19, 2021.

VIII. On August 3, 2020, the board issued a communication under Article 15(1) RPBA, addressing the points to be discussed at the hearing. The board was, among other things, of the preliminary opinion that the objections under Articles 83 and 54 EPC did not preclude the maintenance of the patent. Inventive step of the granted claims starting from D1 as the closest prior art needed to be discussed in the hearing, particularly the question of whether the skilled person would have been suggested the two distinguishing features of the process from D28 or D4. Regarding the maintained auxiliary request, the decision of the opposition division seemed correct.

IX. The oral hearing took place on November 19, 2021, which was conducted as a video conference by mutual agreement due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The requests of the parties were as follows:

The patent holder requested the overturning of the contested decision and the rejection of the oppositions. Alternatively, she requested the maintenance of the patent based on one of the auxiliary requests 1a, 2, 2a, 3, 3a, 4, 4a, 5, and 5a, all auxiliary requests submitted with the letter dated August 28, 2017. Auxiliary request 4 corresponded to the version maintained by the opposition division.

The opponents requested the overturning of the contested decision and the revocation of European Patent No. 2 096 102.

Furthermore, the parties requested the admission or non-admission of various documents into the appeal proceedings, particularly D15 and D28. The opponents also requested the non-admission of various auxiliary requests from the patent holder.

At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeals are admissible.

2. Admission of Documents

2.1 D28

D28 is a standard work on chlor-alkali electrolysis that documents general technical knowledge. D28 was admitted into the proceedings by the opposition division despite its late submission. D28 is discussed in the contested decision.

The patent owner argued that D28 should not have been admitted into the proceedings due to its late submission.

The opposition division has discretion under Article 114(2) EPC to consider or not consider late-filed evidence. According to the established case law of the boards of appeal (see Case Law, 9th edition 2019, IV.C.4.5.2), a board of appeal should only override the manner in which this discretion was exercised if it concludes that the opposition division exercised its discretion based on incorrect criteria, disregarding the correct criteria, or in an arbitrary manner (see, for example, G7/93, OJ 1994, 775). The opposition division's reasoning for admitting the document (point 17.2 of the decision) is based on the fact that D28 reveals general technical knowledge and is also prima facie relevant. These criteria are not objectionable. The opposition division's view that D28 is relevant is further confirmed by the reference to D28 in the reasoning regarding inventive step (point 20, page 23 of the decision). The board therefore does not see that the opposition division's discretionary decision was made using incorrect criteria or was arbitrary. Whether the assessment of the document's relevance by the opposition division is subsequently confirmed by the board is irrelevant. D28 is therefore part of the appeal proceedings.

2.2 D15

2.2.1 D15 is a chapter from the well-known Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, also a standard work representing general technical knowledge.

D15 was not considered by the opposition division as prior art and was therefore not taken into account in the proceedings. The opposition division justified this by stating that no reliable publication date had been provided for D15, see point 16 of the contested decision.

2.2.2 The patent owner requested that this document not be admitted into the appeal proceedings or considered there. The opponents requested its admission.

2.2.3 The board first notes that D15 was part of the opposition proceedings. D15 did not need to be specially admitted into the proceedings, as it was submitted with the notice of opposition within the opposition period.

2.2.4 D15 was downloaded from the online library of Wiley Publishing, which states a publication date of November 15, 2002.

The opposition division stated that D15 itself does not contain a date. It cannot therefore be verified whether D15 actually corresponds to the document that was made available online in November 2002.

2.2.5 The board does not find this argument convincing. The publication date of the book chapter itself, as stated by the publisher, is undisputed. Wiley is a well-recognized scientific publisher. It is therefore initially to be assumed that the downloaded book chapter was published in November 2002. A contrary assertion would have required proof. The fact that no date is noted on the downloaded copy cannot be blamed on the opponents. Furthermore, the copy contains, in addition to the page number of the chapter, the indication that it is the sixth volume of the encyclopedia. If the publication date of D15 were to be questioned, it would have been easy to verify in which edition of the encyclopedia the chapter on chlorine begins in the sixth volume on page 130, and when this was published.

The board therefore sees no reason not to consider D15 in the proceedings.

Main Request of the Patent Owner - Patent as Granted

3. Novelty; Article 100(a) and 54 EPC

3.1 The patent claims a process for producing methylene diphenyl diisocyanates (MDI), characterized in that the aqueous salt solution resulting from the reaction of aniline and formaldehyde to polyamines is not disposed of but is subjected to chlor-alkali electrolysis. The resulting chlorine can then be fed into the process and used to produce phosgene, which is subsequently reacted with the polyamines in the course of the process.

3.2 D1 also discloses a multi-stage integrated process for producing MDI, in which saline wastewater from the first process stage is subjected to electrolysis to use the chlorine obtained in the further course of the process as a reactant. The features of the characterizing part of the independent process claim are therefore known from D1.

This was undisputed.

However, D1 does not disclose whether and how the salt solution is further treated, nor details of the electrolysis step. D1 does not explicitly disclose adjusting the pH of the salt solution to a value of less than 8, nor the total organic carbon (TOC) content of the solution to be electrolyzed of less than 200 ppm, as defined in step A4) of the claim.

This was also undisputed.

3.3 Opponent 1 has now argued that the claimed process is not novel over D1 when considering D15 and D28. D15 and D28 are textbooks, and as such, the content disclosed therein is general technical knowledge. In implementing the electrolysis process, the skilled person would have relied on this technical knowledge and would therefore inevitably have arrived at a process according to the claim. In particular, the maximum content of organic compounds (TOC value) defined in step A4) of the claim is disclosed for electrolysis, specifically membrane electrolysis processes, in Table 7 on page 165 of D15. Acidifying the electrolysis solution according to step A4) of the claim to a pH of < 8 is described both on page 167 of D15 and in Chapter 7.5.6 and Figures 7.78 and 7.79 of D28. D1 therefore discloses, in conjunction with general technical knowledge for implementing an electrolysis process, the process claimed in claim 1.

3.4 The patent owner argued, on the other hand, that D1 does not disclose all the claimed process steps and is therefore not detrimental to novelty.

3.5 The board shares the patent owner's view. It is undisputed that the process steps of adjusting the pH to values less than 8 and purifying the salt solution to a TOC value of less than 200 ppm are not disclosed in D1, either explicitly or implicitly. To deny novelty, the claimed process must be directly and unambiguously disclosed in D1. This corresponds to the established case law of the boards, see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 9th edition 2019, I.C.4.

Whether a skilled person would have carried out the steps not disclosed in D1 in light of the general technical knowledge documented in D15 and D28 when implementing the electrolysis process is a question of inventive step, not of novelty.

4. Inventive Step; Article 100(a) and 56 EPC

4.1 Closest Prior Art

4.1.1 The board agrees with the opposition division in the selection of the document representing the closest prior art. D1 constitutes the closest prior art. As stated above, D1 discloses a multi-stage integrated process for producing methylene diphenyl isocyanates, which also describes the features of the characterizing part of the claim, namely the electrolysis of saline wastewater to obtain chlorine, which can then be used in the further process. The integrated process described in the patent is therefore already known.

D1 specifically addresses the extraction of the di- and polyamines of the diphenylmethane series (""MDA"") formed in the first step of the synthesis from the saline wastewater (see ""Abstract""). Aniline or aniline derivatives are used as extraction agents (see page 8, lines 20-27).

D1 does not disclose that the total organic carbon (TOC) content in the saline wastewater must be adjusted to less than 200 ppm before electrolysis. As correctly noted by the opposition division (page 21 of the contested decision), the corresponding statements in D1 (page 4, top) refer to the concentrations of MDA, and not to the total organic carbon content. Furthermore, D1 does not disclose that the pH of the saline wastewater must be adjusted to less than 8.

The two differences of the claimed process compared to D1 were undisputed.

4.1.2 Opponent 2 also proposed D2 as the closest prior art. However, the process of D2 lacks the electrolysis step. The process from D2 is therefore further removed from the claimed process.

4.2 Problem and Solution

4.2.1 In the opposition decision, starting from D1, the objective technical problem was defined as providing a process that ensures safe execution of the electrolysis, see page 22 of the contested decision.

The board agrees with this.

Opponent 2 proposed as the objective to carry out a reliable electrolysis (page 3 of the appeal response), which corresponds to the problem defined above. Opponent 1 argued that in the absence of comparative and long-term data, the problem should be viewed more generally as an alternative to the process disclosed in D1. The board finds this formulation inappropriate, as the electrolysis process is not detailed at all in D1. It is therefore difficult to speak of an alternative.

The objective technical problem was therefore, starting from D1, to ensure safe or reliable execution of the electrolysis in such a process.

4.2.2 This problem was solved by bringing the saline wastewater to a pH of less than 8 and reducing the organic content (TOC) to below 200 ppm in the course of purifying the saline wastewater, as required in step A4) of the claimed process.

4.3 Obviousness of the Solution

4.3.1 D1 contains no information at all for the practical execution of the electrolysis. D1 describes in the paragraph spanning pages 3 and 4 the necessity for the saline water to meet the requirements for chlor-alkali electrolysis. According to D1, this is particularly the case when the amine content (here referring to the content of MDA, see above) is below 1 ppm. According to the teaching of D1, the saline water can be used as raw material for electrolysis after the extraction presented there, see page 16, lines 6/7.

4.3.2 It must therefore be determined whether the skilled person, in search of a reliable electrolysis process, would have purified the saline solution to an organic content of < 200 ppm and adjusted the pH to a value of less than 8 prior to this purification, as required in step A4) of the claim.

4.3.3 TOC < 200 ppm

The opponents argued that the statement in D1 that the saline wastewater can be subjected to chlor-alkali electrolysis does not mean that no further purification steps are necessary. The skilled person would be aware that to ensure safe execution of the electrolysis, the total organic carbon content must be reduced. This knowledge is documented in D28 and D15. D28 describes in Chapter 7.1.4.2 on page 476 the necessity to investigate the organic content in saline waters generated as by-products and to reduce it if necessary. D15 specifies a limit of 1 ppm TOC for electrolysis cells in Table 7 (page 165).

The patent owner did not explicitly dispute the statement in D28 that the TOC content must be investigated and reduced as necessary depending on the case. However, they argued that according to the teaching of D1, the wastewater generated there could be directly subjected to electrolysis. The skilled person would have no reason to doubt this statement and therefore would not have seen a need for further purification of the wastewater.

The board agrees with the opponents on this point. It is undisputed that the skilled person, as stated in D28, would have determined the TOC of the saline solution before electrolysis and reduced it if necessary, should problems arise with the electrolysis. Setting an acceptable TOC value is therefore a routine measure and does not contribute an inventive step over D1.

4.3.4 pH < 8

However, the board, contrary to the view expressed in the contested decision, believes that adjusting the saline solution to a pH of < 8 before purification was not suggested to the skilled person by the documents of the prior art cited by the opponents.

The opponents referred to passages in D15 and D28 indicating that acidifying the saline solution is beneficial for electrolysis and that the skilled person would have done this in any case. D28 describes in Section 7.5.6 that acidifying the electrolyte is technically advantageous and is therefore usually, though not always, carried out. D15 also states on page 167 that acidifying the saline solution to be electrolyzed is usually performed.

However, the patent owner rightly pointed out that these passages refer to acidifying the saline solution for electrolysis. In the present claim, the saline solution is adjusted to a pH < 8 in A4) before purification, i.e., before reducing the TOC content. Neither D28 nor D15 makes a statement regarding this. These documents therefore do not provide the skilled person with any indication of a process according to the claim.

The opponents further argued that the skilled person would have made the claimed pH adjustment based on the teaching of D4. In particular, they would have done this to remove phenol, which is introduced as an impurity of the aniline used as a reactant or extraction agent. A skilled person would be aware that phenol exists as phenolate in alkaline media in the aqueous phase and therefore must be transferred and removed into the organic phase at a lower pH. The opponents specifically referred to Tables 2-4 of D4, Section 4.9 with Table 14, and the discussion in Section 4.11.

The patent owner rightly pointed out that D4 addresses a different problem than the contested patent. D4 deals with the question of whether, in the purification of saline solutions originating from an MDA process, aniline as an extraction agent can be replaced by toluene due to its toxicity, in order to subject this wastewater to biological post-treatment. It is therefore doubtful for the board whether a skilled person would have referred to D4 in search of a reliable electrolysis process starting from D1.

Even if the skilled person had considered D4, they would not primarily have drawn the conclusion from this document that the saline solutions must be adjusted to a pH of less than 8 before purification. The table cited by the opponents shows the composition of the organic residues in such saline solutions before purification. The components with the largest share are aniline and methanol, whose removal is not positively influenced by the claimed pH reduction. The maximum content of phenol is 150 ppm. The results in Table 4 show that while the removal of phenol works better at a lower pH, they also show that, as the patent owner rightly noted, in none of the conducted processes, regardless of the pH, a TOC content of less than 200 ppm is achieved, solely due to the methanol content. The same is evident from Table 14, which additionally lists the toluene remaining after extraction. The statement cited by the opponents in Section 4.11, that the content of aniline and other impurities can be reduced to below 1 ppm by the described process, does not take into account the toluene remaining after extraction and therefore does not allow conclusions about the achievable TOC value.

Thus, the skilled person cannot derive from D4 that lowering the pH to values < 8 before purifying the saline solution is useful for achieving the TOC values defined in the claim or for reliably conducting an electrolysis.

Opponent 1 also referred to D3 in their appeal. In their view, paragraph [0013] suggests lowering the pH before purification.

Although this argument was not raised again in the further proceedings, particularly in the oral proceedings, the board would still like to comment on it. It is true that paragraph [0013] of D3 describes acidifying a saline solution generated as wastewater. However, the patent owner rightly pointed out that D3 does not refer to the reaction disclosed in D1 in the preceding paragraphs but rather to the production of polycarbonates (see paragraphs [0002], [0009]). A skilled person therefore had no reason to transfer this to the reaction in D1, especially since acidifying in D3 is only one step of a multi-stage purification procedure described in paragraphs [0012] to [0016].

4.3.5 The claimed solution to the technical problem is therefore not suggested to the skilled person starting from D1, even when considering D3, D4, D15, and D28.

4.4 Claim 1 of the granted patent is therefore based on inventive step.

5. Sufficiency of Disclosure Article 100(b) and 83 EPC

5.1 The opponents argued that the remaining content of organic substances (TOC value) in the electrolysis of the MDA wastewater is so high at up to 200 ppm (step A4 of the claim) that the process cannot be executed. In the examples of the patent, saline solutions with much lower residual contents, namely 19 ppm and 24 ppm, were used. It is known from the prior art that high TOC values, particularly the content of nitrogen-containing compounds, must be minimized, as otherwise explosive nitrogen trichloride can form (D15, page 166, D28, page 654, and Table 7.10 on page 539).

5.2 The opposition division was of the opinion that a skilled person would know how to further purify the saline solutions if necessary (see page 17 of the opposition decision).

5.3 The board considers the opposition division's decision on this point to be correct. The process is executable; the claim only stipulates that methylene diphenyl diisocyanates should be obtained. The arguments of the opponents do not demonstrate that this is not possible. Whether the process meets the requirements regarding economic efficiency and safety technology in all embodiments in practice is not a criterion under Article 83 EPC.

Furthermore, the patent owner rightly pointed out that D1 does not specify any limit for the TOC and that the obtained solution, since aniline is used as an extraction agent, has significantly higher TOC values. Following the opponents' arguments, D1 would also contain no executable teaching for electrolysis and would be unusable as a document of the prior art.

6. Since the board is convinced that none of the grounds for opposition preclude the maintenance of the patent, the appeal of the patent owner is upheld. The oppositions are dismissed under Article 101(2) EPC.

The auxiliary requests of the patent owner for maintaining the patent in amended form, to which the opponents' appeals also relate, do not need to be further addressed.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided:, The contested decision is annulled., The oppositions are rejected.",opposition rejected,opposition rejected,decision under appeal is set aside,"Huntsman International LLC, The Dow Chemical Company","Huntsman International LLC 500 Huntsman Way Salt Lake City, UT 84108 / US","Meissner Bolte Partnerschaft mbB, et al, et al Patentanwälte Rechtsanwälte Postfach 86 06 24 81633 München / DE","The Dow Chemical Company Intellectual Property 2030 Dow Center Abbott Road Midland, MI 48640 / US","Beck Greener LLP, et al, et al Fulwood House 12 Fulwood Place London WC1V 6HR / GB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeal of the appellant (opponent) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to maintain the patent EP 2 280 767 in amended form under Article 101(3)(a) EPC.

III. In the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged under Articles 100(a) and 100(b) EPC for lack of novelty, lack of inventive step, and lack of sufficiency of disclosure.

In the contested decision, the opposition division concluded that the claims of the amended auxiliary request 2 met the requirements of Articles 123, 83, and 56 EPC. Novelty was no longer contested. The objections raised against the description adapted to this auxiliary request under Articles 84 and 123(2) EPC were dismissed.

Higher-ranking requests of the patent proprietor were not granted due to lack of inventive step over D1.

IV. In the notice of appeal and in the further proceedings, the appellant essentially argued that the claims of the maintained version were the result of an originally undisclosed selection of features and therefore violated Article 123(2) EPC. The claimed invention was not sufficiently disclosed to the skilled person (Article 83 EPC), as they did not know which substance was meant by the component a) defined in the independent claims. The claimed cosmetic preparations were suggested by D1 (Article 56 EPC), as the components present in the independent claims in addition to D1, namely Carbomer (claim 1), Ethylhexyl salicylate (claim 2), and C12-15 alkyl benzoate (claim 3), were common ingredients of such formulations. An unexpected effect was not associated with their addition; new comparative data D15 were submitted to demonstrate this. Furthermore, the maintained set of claims was also unclear (Article 84 EPC), as some references in dependent claims had been incorrectly adjusted during the amendments made.

V. The respondent submitted a revised set of claims as the main request for maintaining the patent with their response to the appeal, correcting the erroneous references of the dependent claims. Furthermore, they disputed the objections of the appellant and defended the decision made by the opposition division. In particular, they argued that the components that must be present in the claimed compositions in addition to D1 unexpectedly led to reduced yellowing, as shown in D4. Therefore, the claimed compositions were not suggested to the skilled person by the prior art.

VI. By summons dated September 5, 2019, the parties were summoned to an oral hearing on July 9, 2020. The hearing date was subsequently postponed to July 8, 2021, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

VII. On October 10, 2019, the board issued a communication under Article 15(1) RPBA, informing the parties of its preliminary assessment of the factual and legal situation. The board was of the preliminary opinion that the objections raised regarding impermissible extension (Article 123(2) EPC) and lack of disclosure (Article 83 EPC) were not convincing. The objection raised in the statement of grounds of appeal under Article 84 EPC was resolved by the amendments in the new main request. Inventive step starting from D1 would be discussed in the hearing, taking into account the various submitted test results.

VIII. The oral hearing took place on July 8, 2021.

The arguments presented by the parties on the issues relevant to the decision are addressed in detail in the reasons for the decision.

IX. The final requests of the parties were as follows:

The appellant (opponent) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of European patent No. 2 280 767.

The respondent (patent proprietor) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent according to their main request submitted with the response to the appeal or, alternatively, according to the auxiliary request submitted during the oral hearing before the board.

X. The independent claims of the respondent's main request read (emphasis by the board):

""1. Cosmetic preparation containing a combination of

a) 2,4,6-Tris-(biphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine,

b) Phenylbenzimidazolsulfonic acid and/or its salts,

1. The appeal is admissible.

Main Request

2. Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

2.1 Independent claim 1 is based on a combination of original claims 1, 11, and 12. The same applies to independent claims 2 and 3, which originated from a combination of original claims 1, 11, and 6, and 1, 11, and 8, respectively, with a part of the originally disclosed alternatives in claims 12, 6, and 8 being deleted.

This was undisputed.

2.2 The appellant argued that the selection of the compounds polyacrylate (Carbomer) in claim 1, ethylhexyl salicylate in claim 2, and C12-15 alkyl benzoate in claim 3 from original claims 12, 6, and 8 is the result of an inventive selection and thus adds information to the original disclosure. This new information is that the selection of these three components leads to compositions with reduced yellowing. However, compositions with the now claimed components were not originally described as advantageous or particularly suitable compared to other, now unclaimed compositions.

2.2.1 The Board cannot agree with the appellant's opinion. The compositions as such are, as correctly stated by the opposition division, originally disclosed. Potentially advantageous, originally undisclosed properties of the claimed compositions were not added to the claims. The mere deletion of certain originally claimed embodiments in an effort to better distinguish from the prior art does not add any additional information to the now present claims compared to the original application. This is not changed by the fact that technical arguments or data were submitted during the proceedings to underline advantageous properties of the now claimed compositions. The appellant's reference to G 1/93 is irrelevant, as that decision deals with undisclosed features that were added to the claims, which is not the case here.

3. Lack of Enablement (Article 83 EPC)

According to the appellant, the patent suffers from a lack of enablement because the skilled person does not know what is meant by the compound ""2,4,6-Tris-(biphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine"" defined in the claims. Furthermore, this compound was not producible at the time of filing.

The Board cannot agree with this view. A skilled person understands the name ""2,4,6-Tris-(biphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine"" to refer to a 1,3,5-triazine that carries a biphenyl group at positions 2, 4, and 6, respectively. As correctly pointed out by the respondent, this compound is also used in D1, and synthesis methods are provided in the pre-published document D17, examples 1 and 2. The skilled person can recognize from the structural formula (101) provided there that the compound defined in the claims is synthesized in these examples at first glance.

The appellant further argued that the designation ""2,4,6-Tris-(biphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine"" encompasses various conceivable isomers. It is not only meant to refer to a triazine substituted by para-biphenyl; meta- or ortho-linked biphenyl groups are also included.

In the Board's opinion, the skilled person would initially associate the designation ""2,4,6-Tris-(biphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine"" with the para compound, as this is generally known. D1 and D17 use the same nomenclature. Even if the designation ""2,4,6-Tris-(biphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine"" includes compounds that are not specifically disclosed in the prior art, this does not lead to the conclusion that the claimed invention is not executable for the skilled person. Triazines are a long-known class of substances. The Board does not understand why a skilled person, even in the absence of detailed regulations, should not have been able to produce such a compound. The appellant has not provided any technical arguments in this regard.

Therefore, the Board cannot identify a lack of disclosure.

4. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

4.1 The patent relates to compositions for sun protection. According to paragraph [0009] of the patent, these compositions should meet various criteria, including being as little yellowed as possible.

4.2 Closest Prior Art

The closest prior art is D1, which also discloses cosmetic sun protection emulsions. In particular, the composition disclosed in example 6 contains the components defined in the present independent claims (a), (b), and (c); component (c) is listed under its trade name ""Uvinul A Plus®"". The present independent claims differ from this in that the compositions include polyacrylates (Carbomer, claim 1), ethylhexyl salicylate (claim 2), or C12-15 alkyl benzoate (claim 3).

All of this was undisputed.

4.3 Problem and Solution

4.3.1 Component (c) (""Uvinul A Plus®"") has a yellowish tint. Starting from example 6 of D1 as the closest prior art, the problem was to find compositions with a reduced yellow value. The claimed solution consists of the compositions defined in independent claims 1-3, which are characterized in particular by the presence of the aforementioned additives polyacrylates (Carbomer, claim 1), ethylhexyl salicylate (claim 2), or C12-15 alkyl benzoate (claim 3).

4.3.2 It was disputed between the parties whether the addition of these compounds actually demonstrates a reduction in yellow values. The appellant referred to the test results documented in D15 submitted during the appeal proceedings, while the respondent referred to D4. The opposition division had, naturally based solely on D4, considered such an effect to be demonstrated (Point 4.3 of the opposition decision).

4.3.3 D4 compares the composition according to example 6 of D1 with each composition that additionally contains Carbomer (claim 1), ethylhexyl salicylate (claim 2), or C12-15 alkyl benzoate (claim 3). After application to cotton and drying, a reduction in the yellow value b**(*) was observed in all three cases.

4.3.4 D15 compares the composition according to example 6 of D1 with two compositions each containing ethylhexyl salicylate (claim 2) or C12-15 alkyl benzoate (claim 3) in different concentrations. According to D14, the compositions are diluted in a ratio of 1:9 and then also applied to a textile. The line ""before washing"" in D15 shows the yellow values. It appears that of the four tested claimed compositions, three show a lower yellow value than the comparative composition of D1, while one does not.

4.3.5 According to the appellant, D4 cannot demonstrate a generally valid reduction of the yellow value for claimed compositions. No technical concept is recognizable as to why chemically so different compounds such as Carbomer (claim 1), ethylhexyl salicylate (claim 2), or C12-15 alkyl benzoate (claim 3) should show such an effect, unless it is simply a dilution effect upon the addition of additional components. If anything, an effect is only shown for the specifically used concentrations. D15 also shows a certain scatter of the measured values, which underscores that one cannot speak of a systematic effect. Furthermore, the comparative tests lack the preservatives required in the claim, so that an effect for claimed compositions is not demonstrated anyway. Moreover, the measured differences in yellow value are so small that they are invisible to the consumer's eye. In this regard, any potentially measured improvement is commercially uninteresting and therefore not of industrial relevance.

4.3.6 The respondent, on the other hand, pointed out that D4 undeniably demonstrated a numerical effect, which is also visible in the tests submitted by the appellant in D15, except for one of the four measurements. A scientifically comprehensible concept is not required by the EPC. There are no data available that demonstrate an influence of the preservatives defined in the claim, nor is there evidence of a decisive role of the concentrations of the components used in the tests. Whether a consumer can distinguish the measured yellow values or not depends on many circumstances, such as lighting conditions or individual color vision. A physical measurement quantity is therefore objectively better suited to demonstrate a color effect.

4.3.7 In the Board's opinion, the comparison of the results from the comparative tests in D4 and D15 demonstrates a reduced yellowing of claimed compositions compared to those of example 6 of D1 as the closest prior art.

In the comparative tests of D4, all compositions that, starting from example 6 of D1, additionally contain Carbomer (claim 1), ethylhexyl salicylate (claim 2), or C12-15 alkyl benzoate (claim 3) show a reduction in the yellow value. This effect is also shown in three of the four tested compositions in D15. Therefore, the test results submitted by the appellant in D15 rather confirm the results of D4 than undermine them.

It is correct that the respondent has not provided a theoretical concept that could explain the decrease in yellow values. However, as pointed out by the respondent, this is not a requirement of the EPC for patent grant. It even seems that the occurrence of an effect is all the more surprising the less it can initially be explained by a theoretical concept.

A significant influence of the amount of substances added in the sense that an effect could only be achieved in the specific concentrations used in D4 has not been demonstrated. Likewise, an influence of the preservatives required in the claim has not been substantiated. The corresponding claims of the appellant therefore remain unproven.

The Board also agrees with the respondent that a physical measurement quantity for determining the color value provides objective data that can credibly demonstrate an effect. The patent holder is initially free in the choice of the detection method for a specific effect, as long as reliable statements can be made. A demonstration of whether consumers become aware of such an effect is not required for this.

In conclusion, the Board considers the assessment of the opposition division based on D4 to be correct. The additionally submitted test results D15 do not change this.

4.3.8 The compositions defined in the independent claims therefore solve the technical problem of finding sun protection compositions with reduced yellowing starting from D1.

4.4 Obviousness of the Solution

4.4.1 The appellant did not cite any document from the prior art from which a skilled person could deduce that the addition of polyacrylates (Carbomer, claim 1), ethylhexyl salicylate (claim 2), or C12-15 alkyl benzoate (claim 3) leads to a reduction in the yellowing of sun protection compositions. Such teaching does not exist in the prior art. Therefore, a skilled person had no incentive to modify the compositions known from D1 in the claimed manner to solve the technical problem.

4.4.2 While the appellant correctly pointed out that the added components are known per se as ingredients of sun protection products, this was not disputed by the respondent. However, this does not change the fact that a skilled person searching for a solution to the problem posed had no indication to modify the compositions of D1 in the claimed manner.

4.5 The claims of the main request of the respondent therefore involve an inventive step.

5. The main request meets the relevant requirements of the EPC. The patent can therefore be maintained in amended form on the basis of this request under Article 101(3)(a).","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The contested decision is annulled.

Claim 1 has the following wording:

1. A method for producing a composition that is at least substantially alcohol-free with an alcohol content, in particular an ethanol content, of less than 2 vol.-% based on at least one plant extract with secretolytic and/or expectorant properties, wherein the method comprises the following steps:

(a) Providing at least one alcoholic plant extract with secretolytic and/or expectorant properties, wherein the at least one plant extract with secretolytic and/or expectorant properties is selected from the group consisting of thyme extract, primrose root extract, ivy extract, geranium extract, elderberry extract, fennel extract, coltsfoot extract, anise extract, and maidenhair fern extract, as well as mixtures and combinations of at least two of the aforementioned extracts; then

(b) Applying and/or immobilizing the alcoholic plant extract with secretolytic and/or expectorant properties onto a solid water-soluble carrier, wherein the carrier is selected from the group consisting of sugars, sugar substitutes, and carbohydrates, as well as their combinations or mixtures; then

(c) Removing the alcohol by drying; subsequently

(d) Solubilizing the thus obtained alcohol-free carrier containing the plant extract with secretolytic and/or expectorant properties in an aqueous excipient to obtain a composition that is essentially alcohol-free with an alcohol content, in particular an ethanol content, of less than 2 vol.-% based on at least one plant extract with secretolytic and/or expectorant properties.

II. An opposition was filed against the grant of the contested patent, citing lack of novelty and lack of inventive step under Article 100(a) EPC, as well as insufficient disclosure under Article 100(b) EPC.

III. The main request of the patent proprietor in the proceedings before the opposition division was the rejection of the opposition. The patent proprietor submitted further sets of claims as auxiliary requests and ultimately maintained 14 of these auxiliary requests.

IV. During the opposition proceedings, the following pieces of evidence were cited among others:

V. The present appeal by the patent proprietor (appellant) is directed against the decision of the opposition division announced at the oral proceedings on November 28, 2016, and posted on March 6, 2017, to revoke the contested patent.

VI. In the matter, the opposition division came to the following conclusions, among others:

a) The evidence D6-D10 submitted by the opponent after the expiry of the opposition period according to Article 99(1) EPC was admitted into the proceedings.

b) The method defined in granted claim 1 (main request) is not executable across the entire scope of the claim (Article 100(b) EPC), particularly with regard to the required removal of alcohol by drying while simultaneously preserving the active ingredients of the plant extract.

c) The objection of insufficient disclosure (or lack of executability) applies equally to auxiliary requests 1 to 12.

d) Claim 1 of auxiliary request 13 and claim 1 of auxiliary request 14 were deemed unallowable due to extension of the scope of protection under Article 123(3) EPC.

VII. In its statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant requested as the main request the annulment of the contested decision, the rejection of the opposition, and the maintenance of the contested patent in the granted version. It also submitted further sets of claims as auxiliary requests I to V, Va, Vb, and VI to XII.

The auxiliary requests I to V and VI to XII are identical to the auxiliary requests 1 to 12 dealt with in the contested decision. The auxiliary requests Va and Vb are identical to the auxiliary requests 13 and 14 dealt with in the contested decision.

VIII. In its response to the appeal, the opponent (respondent) submitted new experimental data:

D11: Pages 9-10 of the response to the appeal (further experimental data from the respondent)

IX. In accordance with the relevant requests of the parties involved, the board summoned the parties to an oral hearing.

In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, it explained its preliminary assessment, particularly regarding the interpretation of claim 1, the assessment of executability, and the option of remittal under Article 111(1) EPC.

X. The oral hearing before the board took place on March 15, 2022.

The appellant initially requested, among other things, the non-admission of the evidence D6 to D10 and D11. The parties were heard regarding the admission of this evidence and the executability of the method according to claim 1 of the contested patent. The board did not admit D11 and, following the discussion on executability, expressed its view that the subject matter of the main request was sufficiently disclosed. In response to the chairman's question, the respondent stated that novelty over the prior art D2 was acknowledged. Both parties requested the remittal of the case to the opposition division for discussion of inventive step.

XI. The appellant's arguments can be summarized as follows:

Admission of Evidence

The predominantly unpublished documents D6-D10 were submitted late in the proceedings before the opposition division (i.e., after the expiry of the opposition period) and were not presented in response to new facts; their content is also not relevant.

D11 was only submitted with the response to the appeal, although the data presented only pertained to facts that had already been discussed in the first-instance proceedings. Furthermore, it lacks substantive relevance.

Executability

The summary of results from several embodiments presented in the contested patent from paragraph [0136] demonstrates the executability of the method according to claim 1. The burden of proof for the contrary assertion lies with the respondent.

According to the teaching of the contested patent, it is not crucial whether the alcohol is removed or its content adjusted solely in process step (c) or whether process step (d) also contributes to this. Claim 1 does not, contrary to the assumption of the opposition division, refer to a specific active ingredient content in the end product.

Moreover, the contested patent (paragraphs [0091]-[0092]) explicitly states that the temperature and pressure conditions during drying should be adapted to the respective solvents present, which is otherwise routine for the skilled person.

In contrast to this instruction, unrealistic conditions were chosen in the experimental report D1 of the respondent, which were predictably bound to fail, specifically a drying temperature that was set too low.

Furthermore, a single failed attempt cannot fundamentally suffice to meet the burden of proof of the respondent.

XII. The respondent's arguments can be summarized as follows:

Admission of Evidence

Documents D6-D10 contained general technical knowledge regarding known physical data of the substances discussed therein. They were introduced merely for a better understanding of the facts. Therefore, there is no reason not to admit these documents.

The test results according to D11 were submitted to further supplement the respondent's arguments.

Executability

It is not disputed that the method defined in claim 1 of the contested patent is executable in a partial area, for example, when ethanol is the only alcohol present in the alcoholic plant extract used.

However, with reference to the experimental report D1, it is disputed that based on the information in the contested patent, the method, and in particular the drying step (c), is executable in accordance with the claims when higher-boiling alcohols such as glycerin are present in the mixture to be treated, and that the active ingredient content is preserved. The contested patent does not provide concrete guidance on how to choose the process conditions. Therefore, executability is not given across the entire claimed scope.

XIII. The appellant (patent proprietor) ultimately requested in the main request the annulment of the contested decision and the remittal of the case to the opposition division for further decision based on the claims in the granted version or, alternatively, based on one of the sets of claims submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal according to auxiliary requests I to V, Va, Vb, or VI to XII.

Additionally, it requested alternatively the annulment of the contested decision and the rejection of the opposition or, as a secondary request, the maintenance of the patent in amended form based on one of the sets of claims submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal according to auxiliary requests I to V, Va, Vb, or VI to XII.

XIV. The respondent (opponent) requested the rejection of the appeal. In the event that the board should affirm executability, it requested the remittal of the case to the opposition division.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Admissibility of the Appeal

The appeal meets the requirements of Articles 106 to 108 and Rule 99 EPC; it is admissible.

2. Admission of Evidence (Article 12(4) RPBA 2007)

2.1 D6-D10

2.1.1 The evidence D6 to D10 was submitted by the opponent as proof of known physical properties of thymol, sucrose, and polyethylene glycol prior to the time according to Rule 116(1) EPC and was admitted by the opposition division, which considered these documents representative of common general knowledge (see point 14.2 of the contested decision).

2.1.2 The criteria mentioned in Article 12(4) RPBA 2007 (""which could have been presented in the first-instance proceedings or were not admitted there"") do not apply here.

2.1.3 The Board also does not see that the opposition division exercised its discretion incorrectly in this regard. The Board therefore saw no specific reason to overturn the opposition division's discretionary decision to admit D6 to D10.

2.2 D11

2.2.1 The experimental report according to D11 was submitted for the first time with the response to the appeal. It concerns the question of whether and to what extent, depending on the chosen drying conditions, an undesirable loss of active ingredient can occur in the process of the contested patent.

2.2.2 The respondent did not dispute that the selective removal of alcoholic solvents while avoiding active ingredient losses is a technical effect mentioned as advantageous in the contested patent (see paragraphs [0055] and [0099]), which was already addressed in the proceedings before the opposition division in the context of sufficiency of disclosure (see communication from the opposition division dated June 27, 2016, point 7.2.b).

2.2.3 Accordingly, the experimental report D11 should have been submitted in the proceedings before the opposition division. The Board therefore decided, in the exercise of its discretion according to Article 12(4) RPBA 2007, not to admit the experimental report D11 into the proceedings.

3. Sufficiency of Disclosure (Article 100 b) EPC)

3.1 The objection of the respondent regarding insufficient disclosure concerned the method claim 1.

Contested Patent and Claimed Method

3.2 The contested patent aims to provide compositions based on plant extracts with secretolytic and/or expectorant effects that are largely free from alcoholic extraction agents.

3.3 Claim 1 accordingly defines a method that leads from an alcoholic plant extract through several steps to a composition containing extract or active ingredients with an alcohol content of less than 2 vol.%.

3.4 Claim 1 refers to ""alcohol content, in particular (...) ethanol content."" The overall context indicates that the term ""alcohols"" in the contested patent refers to those alcohols used as extraction agents for the preparation of plant extracts. In addition to ethanol, glycolic extraction agents such as glycerin, propylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol are mentioned in the description (but not in claim 1) (see paragraphs [0014], [0035], and [0103] of the contested patent).

Criteria for Assessing Sufficiency of Disclosure

3.5 Claim 1 is a method claim. Regarding its sufficiency of disclosure, it must be assessed whether there are doubts that the method steps defined in claim 1 can be carried out as specified in the claim and lead to an end product that exhibits all the features that must be derived as mandatory from claim 1. Advantages or technical effects not mentioned in the claim itself, as well as technical features not specified in the claim, are irrelevant in this context.

3.6 To substantiate the lack of sufficiency of disclosure of the claimed method, the respondent referred to the experimental report D1 (""Post-processing of the embodiment described in EP 2605831B1"").

D1 apparently aims to demonstrate in a specific case that based on the information in the contested patent, the method steps of claim 1 cannot be carried out or do not lead to a composition that complies with the claim.

It must therefore be assessed whether this has indeed been demonstrated with D1 and, if so, whether this individual result is sufficient to deny the sufficiency of disclosure of the claimed method.

Content of D1

3.7 As presented in D1, a method was carried out using a mixture of thyme extract and primrose root extract, which was based on the embodiment of the contested patent (paragraphs [0136] to [0143]).

3.8 The provision of the extract mixture (containing ethanol and glycerin as alcoholic extraction agents) and its application to a carrier material made of sucrose and PVP by fluidized bed granulation correspond to the steps (a) and (b) according to claim 1 of the contested patent.

3.9 Regarding the drying conditions in the subsequent drying step (c), only a temperature indication (60°C) is provided, so that the drying process cannot be traced in detail. The concentration and quantity specifications in D1 (which, however, are not completely verifiable) seem to suggest that during drying, glycerin (boiling point: 290°C) was not or at least not completely removed, while a certain drying loss of the relatively volatile active ingredient thymol occurred. No statement is made regarding the loss of ethanol.

3.10 After the solubilization according to method step (d), an active ingredient-containing liquid composition with a glycerin content of 0.95 wt.% was obtained. There is no indication in vol.%. The ethanol content is not specified in D1. With the available information, it is therefore not verifiable whether the alcohol content in the composition produced as specified in step (d) of claim 1 was below 2 vol.%. In relation to the plant active ingredients, a significantly higher dilution factor seems to have been chosen in step (d) than in the starting mixture of step (a).

Position of the Parties

3.11 The respective arguments of the parties are summarized in the section ""Facts and Requests"" (see points XI. and XII.).

Interpretation of Claim 1

3.12 For a systematic treatment of the issue and to determine the extent to which D1 corresponds to the claimed method, it is necessary to first establish which mandatory claim features must be fulfilled.

3.13 Here, the question arises as to how the statement in method step (c) ""removal of alcohol by drying,"" when considered together with the definition of step (d), is to be interpreted; in particular:

(i) whether complete removal is intended and

(ii) whether all types of alcohol must be removed by the drying process in step (c).

3.13.1 Regarding point (i):

From the wording ""removal of alcohol"" alone, it cannot be conclusively derived that complete removal is meant.

According to paragraph [0101] of the contested patent (corresponding to page 27, lines 4 to 16 of the originally filed application), in method step (c), the alcohol is ""at least substantially"" removed, i.e., not necessarily completely.

Claim 1 also does not specify the maximum tolerated alcohol content in the dried intermediate product. The specific requirement rather states that the end product from step (d) may contain less than 2 vol.% alcohol.

The solubilization of the dried intermediate product according to method step (d) inevitably involves dilution, as another component is added to the mixture with the aqueous excipient.

If the end product contains a tolerable residual alcohol content in the range of 0 to 2 vol.%, this can therefore originate both from the product of method step (c) and from the excipient added in method step (d) (see also paragraph [0101] of the contested patent, which explains that an ""at least substantially"" alcohol-free excipient is used and that the adjustment of the alcohol content occurs with steps (b) and (c)).

3.13.2 Regarding point (ii):

The main portion of the alcohols used in extraction agents for plant extracts is usually expected to consist of ethanol or other low-boiling alcohols. Furthermore, it is conceivable that in an extract mixture, larger proportions of ethanol may be present alongside smaller amounts of glycerin (as also described in D1), that only ethanol is removed by drying, and that after solubilization, the total alcohol content (including the remaining glycerin) is below 2 vol.%. This variant also does not seem to be explicitly excluded by the wording of the claim.

3.14 Furthermore, the interpretation of the granted claim 1 regarding the active ingredient content in the end product chosen in point 15.1.1 of the contested decision is not comprehensible to the Board: Claim 1 does not specify a tolerable drying loss of volatile plant active ingredients. Nor is there any indication in claim 1 that the active ingredient or extract content in the end product must be at least 95% of the content in the starting product (plant extract before drying). There is not even a requirement that the volumes of the starting product and the end product must be in a specific ratio (for example, 1:1), which would indeed be relevant in this context.

Assessment of Sufficiency of Disclosure

3.15 Even if a certain drying loss of at least thymol was observed in the experiment described in D1 (see above point 3.9), D1 evidently meets the requirement from claim 1 that a composition ""based on at least one plant extract with secretolytic and/or expectorant effect"" is obtained.

3.16 Thus, the question reduces to whether D1 actually demonstrates that method step (c) regarding the removal of alcohol and the adjustment of the targeted alcohol content of less than 2 vol.% in the end product (step (d)) is not executable across the entire claimed range.

3.17 As already noted (see above 3.9-3.10), D1 does not provide any information regarding the removal of ethanol and the alcohol content in the end product in vol.%. The absence of information does not allow for the conclusion that the features according to steps (c) and (d) would not be fulfilled.

3.18 However, it can at least be inferred from the information in D1 that - not surprisingly - glycerin could not be essentially removed from the mixture at 60°C. Considering the considerations under point 3.13, it cannot be concluded from this that the claim features according to steps (c) and (d) would not be fulfilled.

3.19 The experimental report presented in D1 is not suitable for raising justified doubts about the sufficiency of disclosure of the claimed method for the following reasons:

3.19.1 As already explained, the information in D1 does not allow for a statement regarding a failure of method steps (c) and (d), assuming that claim 1 does not necessarily prescribe the removal specifically of glycerin by drying/heating.

3.19.2 Even if that were the case, the fundamental question arises whether a single experiment conducted at a specific point, which is also not fully described and verifiable, can call into question the sufficiency of disclosure of the claimed method.

While the embodiments in the contested patent are also only generally summarized and do not reveal the specific method of drying (see paragraph [0140] of the patent), there is, on the other hand, no concrete reason to assume that the skilled person could not routinely adjust and optimize the process conditions depending on the type of the present extract components and solvents. This is also the instruction given in the contested patent (paragraphs [0089] to [0092], corresponding to page 24, lines 4 to 30 of the originally filed version of the application). Such optimization was not attempted in D1.

The skilled person would avoid conditions that are expected not to be effective. For hypothetical variants that are evidently not implementable by the skilled person due to physical laws, no guidance for practical implementation needs to be provided in the patent/application.

3.20 As already mentioned, claim 1 does not specify any requirements regarding active ingredient losses or a minimum content of extract and active ingredients in the end product. Regarding the question of undesirable active ingredient losses, it should be generally noted that the skilled person would naturally (also for cost reasons) strive to set the process conditions overall so that drying and removal of alcohols occur with minimal active ingredient loss, thus conducting the method in a technically sensible manner. This can be achieved in accordance with the contested patent not only by optimizing the drying conditions but also by avoiding the addition of heavy alcohols in the extraction agent when providing plant extracts with particularly volatile active ingredients as much as possible. These measures fall within the usual activities of the skilled person and do not constitute an unreasonable burden.

3.21 For these reasons, the ground for opposition under Article 100 b) EPC does not preclude the maintenance of the contested patent in the granted version.

4. Referral (Article 111(1) EPC)

4.1 The contested decision particularly addresses the sufficiency of the independent method claim under Article 100 b) and 83 EPC, while no decision of the opposition division has yet been made regarding the ground for opposition of lack of inventive step under Article 100 a) EPC.

4.2 The primary goal of the appeal proceedings is to review the contested decision. Furthermore, the parties involved both requested a referral back to the opposition division for discussion of inventive step.

4.3 These specific reasons argue in favor of referring the matter back to the opposition division for further decision (Article 11 RPBA).","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1.

I. The appeal of the patent holder is directed against the decision of the opposition division to revoke European Patent No. 2 611 430 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Patent"").

II. The oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal took place on September 13, 2021, as a so-called hybrid video conference (mixed-mode).

III. Of the documents cited by the opposition division, document E2 (DE 199 46 384 A1) is relevant for the appeal.

IV. The appellant (patent holder) requested that the contested decision be overturned and that the patent be maintained in amended form based on the claims of auxiliary request 5 submitted with the statement of appeal as a new main request.

The respondents I and II (opponents 1 and 2) requested the dismissal of the appeal. They further requested that the present main request (formerly auxiliary request 5) not be admitted into the proceedings.

V. The parties have essentially presented the following:

a) Appellant

The present main request comprises only claims 1 to 9 of the granted patent. The granted independent claims 10 and 15 are no longer included in the main request, although the appellant considers their subject matter to be novel and based on an inventive step. The appellant wishes to contribute to procedural economy in this manner. They have a right to pursue the granted independent claim 1 further. Such an approach is not procedurally delaying. There was no reason for the patent holder to delete independent claims 10 and 15 during the opposition proceedings, as they believed that their subject matter was novel and based on an inventive step. The appellant is no longer defending these claims, as their business focus has changed since the opposition proceedings and claims 10 and 15 have lost significance for them. Furthermore, it was not intended to circumvent a decision of the opposition division regarding the granted claim 1.

b) Respondent I

The patent holder should have submitted the current main request at the latest during the oral proceedings before the opposition division. They had sufficient time to do so during the oral proceedings. However, the patent holder deliberately refrained from doing so. The submission of the request only with the statement of appeal is, in any case, late.

c) Respondent II

The appellant does have a right to fight for independent claim 1. However, the submission of the current main request only with the statement of appeal contradicts procedural economy and the primary objective of the appeal proceedings, which is to judicially review the contested decision. The granted independent claims 10 and 15 had already been challenged in the opponents' opposition submissions. It was also clear to all parties involved in the opposition proceedings that the subject matter of claims 10 and 15 could likely not be considered novel and based on an inventive step. This is also reflected in the high number of auxiliary requests submitted by the patent holder during the opposition proceedings. Nevertheless, the patent holder deliberately refrained from defending only the granted process claims (claims 1 to 9) in the opposition proceedings. Whether they intended to circumvent a decision of the opposition division regarding these claims is ultimately irrelevant. In any case, the procedural conduct of the appellant has prevented such a decision.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Pursuant to Article 25 (2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office in the version valid since January 1, 2020 (RPBA 2020, see OJ EPO 2019, A63), Article 12 (4) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office in the version of 2007 (RPBA 2007, see OJ EPO 2007, 536) is applicable to the present appeal. This provision stipulates, among other things, that the Board has the authority to reject requests that could have been presented during the first-instance proceedings.

2. The present main request of the appellant was first submitted with the statement of appeal (there as auxiliary request 5) and includes only the granted method claims 1 to 9. The granted apparatus claims 10 to 14 and the granted product-by-process claim 15 are not included in the present main request.

3. In the contested decision, the opposition division concluded that the subject matter of the granted claims 10 and 15 was not novel in view of document E2 (see points 2.3.3.3.1 and 2.3.3.2.1 of the reasons for the decision). However, the subject matter of the granted claim 1 was found to be novel over this document.

The current main request is therefore prima facie suitable to address the novelty objections on which the contested decision is based.

4. However, regarding the exercise of discretion under the provisions of Article 12 (4) RPBA 2007, the question arises as to whether the present main request, which is directed only at the granted method claims 1 to 9, should have been filed during the opposition proceedings. It must be examined whether, in light of the specific circumstances of the case, it could have been expected of the patent holder that they would submit the request in the first-instance proceedings (see T 1538/10, point 2.2 of the reasons for the decision).

5. First, it should be noted that the opponents raised objections against the granted method claims 1 to 9 in their opposition statements (see, for example, point II of the opposition statement of opponent 1 and points B.V.1.1 to B.V.1.5 and B.V.2.1 to B.V.2.6 of the opposition statement of opponent 2). These objections, particularly those regarding an alleged lack of inventive step, were not thoroughly discussed in the opposition proceedings and in the decision of the opposition division because the patent holder maintained the apparatus and product-by-process claims in the submitted claim sets according to the then main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 21, and the opposition division concluded that these claims were not allowable due to their lack of novelty.

6. Furthermore, there was already an opportunity during the opposition proceedings to submit the present main request.

The minutes of the oral proceedings before the opposition division indicate, in particular, the following: During the oral proceedings before the opposition division, the chair announced that the subject matter of claim 1 was novel, but the subject matter of claims 10 and 15 was not to be considered novel (see last paragraph on page 1 of the minutes). The announcement of this conclusion by the opposition division should have prompted the patent holder to submit at least a fallback request that included the (not contested by the opposition division) claim 1, but not claims 10 and 15.

The minutes further indicate that the patent holder was given multiple opportunities during the oral proceedings to prepare and submit new requests in light of the novelty deficiency of the apparatus claims (see page 2, first paragraph, to page 3, second to last paragraph, of the minutes). While the patent holder used these opportunities to submit three additional new auxiliary requests in addition to the 18 auxiliary requests already in the proceedings, the present main request, which is limited to the method claims, was not among them, even though the opposition division had already recognized their novelty after the first consultation break. Rather, all auxiliary requests submitted during the oral proceedings before the opposition division included a modified apparatus claim 10.

7. Through their procedural conduct, the patent holder circumvented a complete examination and decision by the opposition division regarding the objections raised against the method claims. The question of whether this was done intentionally is ultimately irrelevant. In any case, the submission of the new main request in the appeal proceedings represents a significant shift in the subject matter of the dispute compared to the contested decision. In particular, if the present main request were to be admitted, the appeal proceedings would either have to address for the first time exclusively a subject matter related to a method, against which objections were raised along different lines of attack than those underlying the contested decision, or the case would have to be referred back to the opposition division. Both alternatives do not appear desirable in terms of procedural economy (see also T 1705/07, point 8 of the reasons for the decision; T 38/13, point 2.2 of the reasons for the decision).

8. The appellant's argument that the submission of the present main request only with the statement of appeal is based on a change in their business focus appears less relevant. The Board does not consider that a changed economic assessment by the appellant, in itself, can justify a late submission of the present main request.

9. In light of these considerations, the Board decided, in the exercise of its discretion under Article 12 (4) RPBA 2007, that the main request before it is not admitted into the proceedings.

10. In the absence of admitted requests, the appeal was therefore dismissed.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,"LTS LOHMANN Therapie-Systeme AG, Purdue Pharma LP",LTS LOHMANN Therapie-Systeme AG Lohmannstrasse 2 56626 Andernach / DE,"Plate, Jürgen, et al, et al Plate Schweitzer Zounek Patentanwalt Industriepark Kalle-Albert, Gebäude H391 Rheingaustraße 196 65203 Wiesbaden / DE",Purdue Pharma LP One Stamford Forum 201 Tresser Boulevard Stamford CT 06901 / US,Maiwald GmbH Elisenhof Elisenstraße 3 80335 München / DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

II. The patent application relates to a method for handling aqueous methanesulfonic acid solutions.

III. In the examination procedure, reference was made in particular to the following prior art:

D2|US 6 120 619 A (GOUDIAKAS JEAN [FR] ET AL) September 19, 2000 |

D3|Arkema: ""Arkema Methanesulfonic Acid - Cleaning and Descaling"", Application Information, January 17, 2007, pages 1-4, XP002627165|

IV. In its decision, the examining division found that the method according to claim 1 of the then main request was novel, but did not involve an inventive step starting from D4. From the examining division's perspective, the claimed method differed from the method known from D4 only in the higher concentration of methanesulfonic acid (MSA) (50-99 wt.% as opposed to 44% or 38.8 wt.% in D4). In their view, it was obvious to use the steels that had already proven effective at lower concentrations of MSA also at higher concentrations.

V. The patent applicant (appellant) filed an appeal against this decision. Initially, she maintained the then main request and submitted five auxiliary requests with the statement of grounds of appeal (March 21, 2017). After receiving the preliminary opinion of the board, she replaced auxiliary request 1 with a modified version and submitted an additional auxiliary request 6 (July 17, 2020). Following a telephone consultation, she submitted a new main request with her submission of August 26, 2020. In addition to this new main request, she retained only auxiliary requests 2-6, which were renumbered accordingly.

VI. Claim 1 of the main request of August 26, 2020 reads as follows:

""Method for handling aqueous solutions of methanesulfonic acid (MSA) with a concentration of 50 to 99 wt.% MSA in devices where the aqueous MSA solution is in contact with steel surfaces, wherein the steel is austenitic steel with a chromium content of 15 to 22 wt.% and a nickel content of 9 to 15 wt.%, and wherein the temperature of the MSA during handling is less than 40 °C, characterized in that the total chloride content in the aqueous MSA solution is less than 25 mg/kg.""

Dependent claims 2-5 relate to preferred embodiments.

VII. The appellant essentially argued the following regarding inventive step:

Documents D2-D4 describe the use of MSA solutions on austenitic steels and their influence on corrosion, thus relating to the same technical field as the present patent application.

However, the distinguishing feature over these documents is not solely seen in the MSA concentration. An aqueous MSA solution typically contains chloride, with the chloride content depending on the manufacturing process. The chloride content was not specified in documents D2-D4. Therefore, the total chloride content defined in claim 1 should be regarded as an additional distinguishing feature.

D2 is closest to the claimed MSA concentration and should thus be considered the closest prior art.

The mentioned differences lead to a reduced corrosive effect of the MSA solution, so that the objective technical problem is seen as providing an improved method.

The skilled person finds no indication in the prior art that a total chloride content below 25 mg/kg is particularly advantageous in terms of a reduced corrosive effect, so that an inventive step should be recognized.

VIII. The appellant requested that the contested decision be overturned and a patent be granted based on the main request (claims 1-5) of August 26, 2020, or alternatively based on one of the auxiliary requests 1-4 (submitted as auxiliary requests 2-5 with letter of March 21, 2017) or auxiliary request 5 (submitted as auxiliary request 6 with letter of July 17, 2020).","Reasons for the Decision

Main Request

1. Article 13(2) RPBA 2020

In the present case, the summons to the oral proceedings was issued on March 19, 2020, i.e., after the entry into force of the RPBA 2020. Accordingly, Article 13(2) RPBA 2020 is applicable (see Article 25(3) RPBA 2020).

The submission of the amended main request was made in response to the objections raised for the first time in the communication of the Board and during the telephone consultation with the rapporteur. This was sufficiently justified by the appellant. Furthermore, the proposed amendment addresses all raised objections, does not raise any new questions, and supports procedural economy. Thus, the Board concludes that exceptional circumstances within the meaning of Article 13(2) RPBA 2020 are present.

2. Amendments

2.1 Claim 1 has been restricted in that the total chlorine content is less than 25 mg/kg and the temperature during handling is less than 40 °C.

2.2 These amendments are based on the originally filed application (page 2, line 39, as well as claim 4) and thus meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

3. Rule 43(1) EPC

3.1 The two-part form of claim 1 has been adjusted such that the features belonging to the prior art are included in the preamble and the characterizing part indicates the difference from the prior art (cf. the statements on novelty and inventive step, points 4.1 and 5.), thus also fulfilling the requirements of Rule 43(1) EPC.

4. Novelty

4.1 The claimed method is novel, as none of the cited prior art D2-D4 discloses methods using MSA at a concentration of 50 to 99 wt.% with a total chlorine content of less than 25 mg/kg.

The examples of the present application show that the total chlorine content can vary due to manufacturing conditions and does not necessarily fall within the claimed range. Therefore, in the present case, without mentioning the total chlorine content or knowledge of the specific manufacturing process used in the prior art, it cannot be assumed that the total chlorine content is inherently within the claimed range.

Although D4 describes the effect of adding chloride on the corrosion rate (Figure 1, lower graph) and shows a data point at ""0 ppm Cl**(-)"", this refers to the amount of Cl**(-) added as HCl. However, D4 does not provide information on the total chlorine content of the MSA used. In particular, it is not known whether the MSA used, which is merely described as ""technical grade MSA"" (page 63, right column, first complete paragraph, last line), contains bound chlorine (Table 2 of the present application along with page 2, lines 40-41).

4.2 The requirements of Article 54(1),(2) EPC are thus fulfilled.

5. Inventive Step

5.1 The present application relates to a method for handling concentrated aqueous solutions of MSA in steel devices with good corrosion resistance (page 1, lines 3-5; page 2, lines 13-15 and 26-33).

5.2 D2 also relates to the prevention of corrosion of steels in the presence of organosulfonic acids, e.g., MSA (column 1, lines 6-22 and 56-62) and is thus considered the closest prior art.

5.3 D2 describes that the corrosion rate depends on the MSA concentration, temperature, and type of steel, and that a 304L type steel can already corrode at room temperature in the presence of MSA concentrations over 10**(-2) mol/L (column 1, lines 15-21). In a series of tests, differently diluted aqueous solutions of MSA are brought into contact at 45 °C with such a 304L type steel as well as 316L type steel (Example 5; Tables VII and VIII), i.e., with austenitic steels of a composition within the claimed range. In one test, 70% MSA is used without further dilution (the last line of the mentioned tables).

5.4 The claimed method thus differs from D2 in that the total chlorine content of the aqueous MSA solution is less than 25 mg/kg (see point 4.1).

5.5 The examples of the present application show that, compared to MSA with a higher total chlorine content, the corrosion rate of the steels used according to the claim (steels No. 1-3 in Table 3) is reduced.

5.6 In contrast, D2 improves corrosion resistance by adding oxidizing additives (D2, Example 5 and claim 1).

5.7 The objective technical problem can thus be seen as providing an alternative method for handling aqueous solutions of MSA in the presence of low-alloy austenitic steels, achieving good corrosion resistance.

5.8 To solve this problem, the claimed method is proposed, according to which MSA with a total chlorine content of less than 25 mg/kg is used.

5.9 The examples of the present application, particularly the comparison of samples MSA1 and MSA2 (invention) with MSA5 (comparison), show that the problem posed is successfully solved, with the examples being illustrative for the claimed temperature range of less than 40 °C. Although the mentioned samples differ not only in chlorine content but also in sulfate content, the comparison sample MSA5 has a sulfate content (56 mg/kg) between those of the two inventive samples (8 mg/kg and 155 mg/kg), so that the lower corrosion rate can be attributed to the lower chlorine content.

5.10 The skilled person finds no indication in the cited prior art that the corrosion rate can be reduced by using MSA with a total chlorine content of less than 25 mg/kg.

Although D4 is known for the effect of adding 1000 ppm, 2000 ppm, and 5000 ppm of chloride ions in the form of HCl to 25% MSA at 95 °C on the corrosion rate of 316L type steel (Figure 1, lower graph), where the addition of chloride adversely affects corrosion resistance, the chloride content of the MSA used is not specified, and it is not known what total chlorine content corresponds to the data point without HCl addition.

5.11 Therefore, the claimed method involves an inventive step in light of the present prior art (Article 56 EPC).

5.12 The same conclusion applies to the preferred embodiments defined in the dependent claims.

I. The appeal is directed against the decision of the Opposition Division to reject the opposition against European Patent EP 2 354 117 under Article 101(2) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged under Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC) and lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC), under Article 100(b) EPC for insufficient disclosure, and under Article 100(c) EPC for inadmissible amendments.

III. During the opposition proceedings, the following documents were referenced, which are also relevant for the present decision:

IV. In the opposition decision, the grounds for opposition raised under Articles 100(a), 100(b), and 100(c) EPC were dismissed. The application was not found to have been unallowably amended during the examination procedure (Article 123(2) EPC). The claimed use was also found to be sufficiently disclosed to the skilled person (Article 83 EPC), novel over the disclosures of documents D2/D17, D21a/D21b, and D1 (Article 54 EPC), and based on an inventive step, particularly starting from document D11 as the closest prior art (Article 56 EPC).

V. An appeal was filed by the opponent on September 1, 2017, which was substantiated on November 20, 2017.

VI. The respondent (patent holder) submitted arguments regarding the allowability of their main request, i.e., the granted patent, as well as the auxiliary requests Ia, Ib, II, IIa, and IIb submitted with the same letter dated March 29, 2018.

VII. By letter dated August 31, 2020, the parties were summoned to oral proceedings scheduled for April 26, 2021.

VIII. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the parties were informed of the preliminary assessment of the Board. The Board was, among other things, of the preliminary opinion that the main request met the requirements of Articles 123(2), 83, 54, and 56 EPC.

IX. Claim 1 of the granted patent and the present main request has the following wording:

""Method for producing nitrobenzene by adiabatic nitration of benzene with mixed acid containing sulfuric acid and nitric acid, wherein

(i) benzene and mixed acid are introduced into a reactor either

a) separately

or

b) together, after both have been contacted,

wherein in case a) at least one of the reactants benzene or mixed acid, in case b) the process product obtained after contacting benzene and mixed acid, enters the reactor under a pressure p1;

(ii) benzene and mixed acid are dispersed into one another in the reactor in 1 to 30 consecutively arranged dispersion elements;

(iii) the reaction product after leaving the reactor is subjected to phase separation in a phase separation apparatus, in whose gas phase the pressure p2 prevails;

characterized in that

(iv) the pressure difference p1 - p2 is between 15 bar and 25 bar.""

X. In its appeal and further proceedings, the appellant mainly argued the following points relevant to the present decision:

Claim 1 of the contested patent was unallowably amended during the grant procedure by changing the feature relating to the pressure difference.

Furthermore, the skilled person would not be able to carry out the claimed method. The range of pressure difference, which consists of various contributions, is not sufficiently defined, not the entire pressure range is realizable, neither the type of reactor nor the exact measurement method or the measurement point to be used are defined without contradiction, and moreover, the claimed pressure range is merely to be regarded as a desideratum that adjusts itself automatically with a given volumetric flow through a specific apparatus.

The claimed method is also not novel in view of the disclosures of documents D2/D17, D21a/D21b, and D1.

The method also does not involve an inventive step, regardless of whether D11, D2, D4, D19, or D21a/D21b is considered as the closest prior art. Document D11 is also not suitable as a starting point for assessing inventive step. In connection with inventive step, the appellant particularly questioned the significance of the examples of the contested patent and document D26.

XI. Regarding the points relevant to the present decision, the respondent mainly argued the following:

A basis for the amended pressure difference range can be derived from the originally filed description.

The claimed method is executable, and a large part of the appellant's arguments in this regard does not relate to the question of disclosure.

Novelty of the claimed method is particularly given because the claimed range for the pressure difference p1 - p2 from 15 bar to 25 bar is disclosed in the originally filed description.

Regarding the presence of inventive step, the respondent addressed the documents cited in the appellant's arguments. They particularly referred to the technical effects claimed in relation to the test reports D26 and D27.

XII. Requests of the Parties

The appellant (opponent) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent. They further requested that neither documents D26 and D27 nor the auxiliary requests of the respondent be admitted.

The respondent (patent holder) requested the dismissal of the appeal and thus the maintenance of the patent in the granted version (main request), or alternatively, the maintenance of the patent according to one of the auxiliary requests Ia, Ib, II, IIa, or IIb submitted with the appeal.

XIII. An oral hearing took place on April 26, 2021, with the consent of both parties in the form of a video conference. The appellant was not represented during the oral proceedings, as announced by fax on April 23, 2021.

At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

Admission of Documents D26 and D27

2. Document D26 was submitted by the patent holder/respondent during the opposition proceedings and was admitted into the proceedings by the opposition division. The opposition division justified the admission of the document by stating that it was submitted by the patent holder in a timely manner, namely within the deadline along with the response to the notice of opposition. Therefore, there was no legal basis for non-admission apparent. In this context, the Board also does not see how the assessment by the opposition division could be erroneous. The Board therefore sees no reason to grant the request of the appellant.

3. The appellant further requested that Document D27 not be admitted into the proceedings. Since the document is not relevant for the present decision, a decision on its admission is unnecessary.

Main Request - Patent as Granted

4. Unallowable Amendment (Article 100(c) EPC)

4.1 The opposition division had rejected the objection of unallowable extension. The appellant disagreed with the assessment of the opposition division, arguing that the amendment of feature (iv) of the claim is indeed associated with an extension of the disclosure content. On one hand, the amended range for the pressure difference, namely ""15 bar to 25 bar,"" is not individualized in connection with all other features of the claim as disclosed in the originally filed application documents. On the other hand, there is also no basis for the inclusion of the values limiting the range ""15 bar"" and ""25 bar.""

4.2 In the opinion of the Board, lines 3 to 21 of page 5 of the originally filed description provide support for the amendment made. In particular, both the claimed range and explicitly the two values limiting this range are disclosed in line 20. The restriction of the originally filed claim 1 from the range ""between 14 bar and 40 bar"" to the narrower, explicitly disclosed particularly preferred range ""15 bar to 25 bar"" in the amended claim 1 does not therefore substantiate the objection raised under Article 100(c) EPC.

5. Sufficiency of Disclosure (Article 100(b) EPC)

5.1 The appellant also contested the assessment of the opposition division, which had affirmed the sufficiency of disclosure of the claimed invention.

5.2 The Board does not share the view that the arguments presented by the appellant can establish a lack of sufficiency of disclosure for the following reasons:

5.3 The claimed process is for the production of nitrobenzene by adiabatic nitration of benzene with mixed acid. The process is characterized by the process steps (i) to (iv). The first three steps define the introduction of benzene and mixed acid into a reactor, the dispersing of benzene and mixed acid in the reactor, and the phase separation of the reaction product in a phase separation apparatus. Step (iv) requires that the pressure difference between the entry of either at least one of the reactants benzene or mixed acid (case a) in the first process step), or the process product obtained after contacting benzene and mixed acid (case b) in the first process step) into the reactor (pressure p1), and the pressure of the gas phase of the phase separation apparatus (pressure p2), is between 15 bar and 25 bar.

5.4 To be able to carry out the process, the skilled person must be able, based on the technical information contained in the patent and their general technical knowledge, to perform the individual process steps and ultimately obtain nitrobenzene. In particular, they must be able to determine the two pressures p1 and p2 and their difference. The Board is of the opinion that the skilled person is already capable of determining the required pressure difference considering the information in the description of the contested patent, particularly paragraphs [0008], [0022], [0026], [0035], as well as Example 4.

5.5 The appellant argued that the pressure difference range consists of various contributions, which are not defined in detail.

The Board is of the opinion that for the question of the workability of the claimed process, it is not essential from which individual contributions this measurable total pressure difference is composed, as this is not required in the claim and thus does not constitute a claim feature.

5.6 The appellant further argued that not the entire claimed range of the pressure difference is realizable.

This argument is also not convincing. The appellant already proposes in their appeal brief measures that the skilled person could take to achieve pressure differences in the upper claimed range, namely an appropriate adjustment of the throttles in the reactor, or the use of a pressure reducing valve (see point 5 on pages 25 and 26 of the appeal brief).

5.7 The appellant also argued that neither the type of reactor for which the teaching of the contested patent is to apply is specified, nor the exact measurement point or a precise measurement method for determining the pressure difference. This is necessary, as the contested feature is an unusual parameter, and the measurement value is at least dependent on temperature and any fluctuations in flow rate.

This argument is also not convincing. The claimed process is not limited to a specific reactor. Furthermore, the description refers to a preferably suitable design for a tubular reactor (paragraphs [0023], [0041] and following). The skilled person also finds instructions in the contested patent for pressure measurement (paragraph [0035]). This also applies to the measurement point, which is already indicated in claim 1, and additionally in the description (see paragraphs [0022] and [0026]). A dependence of the measured pressure difference on temperature or any fluctuations in flow rate will not prevent the skilled person from taking pressure measurements and determining their difference. Against this background, the Board cannot identify a deficiency in disclosure.

5.8 Another line of argument from the appellant related to effects associated with the features of the contested patent.

However, the effects cited are not features of the claim and thus are not part of the definition of the claimed process. Therefore, it is not essential for the assessment of sufficiency of disclosure whether these effects are achieved by carrying out the claimed process or not.

5.9 The Board therefore agrees with the assessment of the opposition division that the arguments presented by the appellant do not substantiate an objection under Article 100(b) EPC.

6. Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

6.1 In the opposition proceedings, novelty was acknowledged with respect to the disclosure of documents D2/D17, D21a/D21b, and D1. In contrast, the appellant maintained in the appeal proceedings that the claimed process is not novel in view of the disclosure of these documents.

6.2 The Board cannot concur with this view for the following reasons:

6.2.1 Documents D2/D17 and D21a/D21b do not contain any direct and unambiguous disclosure of the claimed feature (iv), which states that ""the pressure difference p1 - p2 is between 15 bar and 25 bar.""

6.2.2 Although this can be calculated, as argued by the appellant, by selecting from the specified values for the pressure drop per mixing element and for the number of mixing elements contained in the tubular reactor, not all possible combinations lead to values that fall within the claimed range.

For example, documents D2 and D17 disclose a tubular reactor for the adiabatic nitration of benzene or toluene, which has 3 to 11 floors (4 to 12 chambers), with a pressure drop of 0.5 to 4 bar per floor (see claims 1 and 2 respectively). By appropriately selecting the number of floors and the pressure drop per floor, the skilled person can arrive at combinations that yield a total pressure drop in the reactor of 15 to 25 bar; however, this does not initially correspond to the pressure difference between the reactor entry and the phase separation apparatus. Moreover, not all of the combinations fall within the scope of the process claimed in the contested patent. Furthermore, the documents teach the skilled person to select specific combinations of the number of floors and pressure loss per floor that do not necessarily lead to the claimed pressure difference (D2: paragraph [0018], D17: paragraph [0022]; corresponding teachings in D21a: paragraphs [0018] and [0033]; D21b: page 5, lines 17 to 19 and page 9, lines 4 to 13).

Additionally, the documents do not disclose any information about the pressure of the gas phase of a phase separation apparatus. The appellant claimed in this context that the tubular reactor directly transitions into the phase separation apparatus, and therefore it is irrelevant whether the total pressure in the system is determined at the end of the tubular reactor or in the phase separation apparatus (see the second complete paragraph on page 48 of the appeal brief). However, this claim is called into question by the appellant's own statements regarding pressure reduction in a production facility (see point V.3.2 on page 21 of the appeal brief).

6.2.3 Regarding document D1, the respondent argued in addition to the arguments already presented in the opposition proceedings that due to hydrostatic contributions to the pressure difference, the actual pressure occurring in D1 must be higher than the value of 14.5 bar, and that the effective components in the claimed lower value of 15 bar are lower, and therefore the claimed lower value of the pressure difference is disclosed in D1.

6.2.4 However, the Board cannot agree with this. The skilled person explicitly derives the value of 14.5 bar from D1, which lies outside the claimed range.

6.3 Therefore, the claimed process is not directly and unambiguously disclosed in the cited documents. Thus, the main request, as already determined by the opposition division, meets the requirement of novelty in the sense of Article 54 EPC.

6.4 Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

6.4.1 In the decision of the opposition division, the objection of lack of inventive step was assessed particularly based on document D11 as the closest prior art. In point 8.5 of the decision, however, other approaches based on documents D2, D1, D4, and D3 were also discussed. The opposition division concluded in each case that inventive step was present.

6.4.2 The appellant argued that document D11 is not suitable as the closest prior art. Nevertheless, the claimed process is suggested to the skilled person both from D11, but particularly from one of the documents D2, D4, D19, or D21a/D21b. The latter documents exhibit the most structural-technical similarities and are directed towards a comparable technical purpose as the contested patent. They are thus better suited as the closest prior art. The appellant particularly questioned the significance of the examples of the contested patent and document D26 in their argumentation and defined the objective technical problem as providing an alternative.

Closest Prior Art

6.4.3 The Board first notes that document D19, as already established by the opposition division, does not constitute prior art in the sense of Article 54(2) EPC (see point 5 of the contested decision). The document was published on March 31, 2010, and thus before the filing date (February 2, 2011), but after the priority date (February 5, 2010) of the contested patent.

The validity of the priority of the contested patent was disputed by the appellant. However, since the content of the priority document is identical to that of the originally filed application (see in particular the claims and page 5, line 20), and the other requirements of Article 87 EPC were not questioned, the claimed priority is valid. Document D19 thus constitutes prior art only in the sense of Article 54(3) EPC and cannot therefore be used for the assessment of inventive step.

6.4.4 The Board also agrees with the opinion of the opposition division that among the available documents, D11 represents the closest prior art for the claimed process. The reasons for this are as follows:

The contested patent specifically addresses the issue of space-time yield and product quality, particularly in connection with the formation of by-products such as dinitrobenzene, nitrophenol, and trinitrophenol in adiabatically conducted nitration reactions of aromatics (see in particular paragraphs [0005], [0013], [0016] to [0018], as well as Table 1).

Document D11 also points to these problems (see in particular column 2, lines 25 to 32 and column 3, lines 6 to 12, as well as lines 55 and 56). In contrast, document D2 also deals with the nitration of aromatics but specifically refers to the issue of the end conversion of the reaction (see paragraphs [0008], [0009], and [0011]). Neither the problem of space-time yield nor the formation of the aforementioned by-products is mentioned. Documents D4 and D21a/D21b also do not primarily address the problem of improving space-time yields as discussed in the contested patent. Document D4 relates to the dinitration of aromatics (see in particular page 3, lines 55 to 59). This is precisely what the contested patent aims to prevent. Documents D21a and D21b mention the formation of by-products due to over-nitration (see paragraphs [0004] and [0009] in D21a) but do not address the issue of improving space-time yields.

6.4.5 The Board is also of the opinion for the following reasons that the claimed process based on the technical teaching of document D11 involves an inventive step. As stated in point 6.4.14 of this decision, however, a consideration based on the other documents cited by the appellant leads to the same result.

Distinguishing Feature, Technical Problem, and Claimed Solution

6.4.6 Document D11 discloses a pressure in the gas phase of the phase separation apparatus (column 6, lines 52 to 59; corresponding to p2 in claim 1). However, it does not disclose the pressure of one of the reactants benzene or mixed acid, or of the process product obtained after their contact, upon entry into the reactor (corresponding to p1 in claim 1). The process according to the main request thus differs from the process disclosed in D11 by the feature ""that (iv) the pressure difference p1 - p2 is between 15 bar and 25 bar.""

6.4.7 The appellant questioned whether the distinguishing feature demonstrably produces a technical effect. They argued in particular that the examples described both in the patent and in document D26 are very close to the lower end of the claimed pressure difference and are therefore not representative for the entire range. Furthermore, the pressure difference consists of various partial pressures that are not further defined in the contested patent, of which at least not all could influence the space-time yield. Additionally, essential data, particularly data regarding the equipment used, are not disclosed in document D26. Thus, a comparison with the information in the contested patent is not possible.

6.4.8 The Board follows the opinion of the opposition division and the respondent that the distinguishing feature identified with respect to D11 produces a technical effect:

a) The description of the contested patent states that the process leads to a high space-time yield with very low by-product contents (see paragraph [0049]). From Table 1, it is evident that the space-time yield in Example 4, where the pressure difference p1 - p2 is 15.8 bar within the claimed range, is 7.2 t/m³h, which is greater than in Examples 1 to 3, where the space-time yield only ranges between 5.5 and 6.4, and which were conducted at pressure differences between 9.7 and 12.6 bar, thus below the lower value of 15 bar of the claimed range. At the same time, the contents of the by-products dinitrobenzene, nitrophenols, and picric acid in Example 4 are significantly below the corresponding values of Examples 1 to 3. The skilled person can thus derive a technical effect associated with the distinguishing feature from Table 1.

b) Document D26 shows that at a claimed pressure difference of 15.27 bar (Example 5), a higher yield of nitric acid is achieved after the first of three reactors with 73.0% than at a non-claimed pressure difference of 14.87 bar (Example 6). The formation of the mentioned by-products is slightly worse in Example 5 (0.22 compared to 0.21 for nitrophenol), or slightly better (0.019 compared to 0.021 for trinitrophenol and 0.015 compared to 0.017 for dinitrobenzene) than in Example 6. The skilled person can thus also derive a technical effect associated with the distinguishing feature from document D26.

c) The appellant argued that the pressure difference in a nitration reactor consists of several partial pressures. However, the Board does not see how this aspect is relevant to the technical effect produced by the pressure difference p1 - p2. In the mentioned examples, a technical effect is associated with the pressure difference p2 - p1, regardless of how this pressure difference arises. Furthermore, in the Board's view, it is irrelevant whether a high space-time yield can also be achieved by other measures, as argued by the appellant (see pages 51 to 52 of the appeal brief).

d) The further argument of the appellant that the same type of reactor was not used in Examples 5 and 6 (see pages 52 to 53 of the appeal brief) is also not convincing to the Board. In the description of the experiments in document D26, in the Board's opinion, there is nothing to suggest the use of different equipment for conducting experiments 5 and 6. The respondent has also opposed this interpretation (see respondent's reply, point V.2.2.1).

e) Likewise, the appellant's assertion that essential data regarding the equipment and process execution are missing in document D26, and therefore the obtained data cannot be compared with the results of the contested patent, does not lead to the conclusion that the distinguishing feature does not produce a technical effect. To demonstrate a technical effect, a comparison of the data according to Table 1 of the contested patent on the one hand, and the data of document D26 on the other hand, is sufficient. A comparison between the two documents is not meaningful, already due to the different process conditions in the patent and in D26.

6.4.9 The Board therefore believes that it can be inferred from the mentioned documents that an increase in the pressure difference p1 - p2 leads to an increase in the space-time yield (Examples 1 to 4 according to the contested patent), or that the yield of nitric acid can be increased after the first of three sequential tubular reactors of a plant (Examples 5 and 6 from D26), without this leading to a significant increase in the content of formed by-products.

6.4.10 Thus, the objective technical problem can be seen as providing an improved process for the production of nitrobenzene by adiabatic nitration of benzene with mixed acid, wherein the improvement consists in an increase in the space-time yield without increasing the content of formed by-products.

6.4.11 As shown by the previously mentioned experiments, the technical problem is solved by a process in which the pressure difference p1 - p2 is between 15 bar and 25 bar.

6.4.12 The Board is also convinced that the technical problem is solved across the entire claimed breadth. The appellant's indication that there is no example for the upper pressure range alone cannot lead to the conclusion that the observed technical effect does not occur across the entire claimed range.

Obviousness of the Solution

6.4.13 The skilled person cannot derive any indication from the submitted prior art regarding a correlation between an increase in the space-time yield and the pressure difference p1 - p2 defined in the claim. This already follows from the fact that none of the cited documents disclose the said pressure difference.

Whether, as argued by the appellant in connection with sufficiency of disclosure, the claimed pressure loss self-adjusts for a given reactor configuration cannot lead to a different assessment of inventive step, as this approach disregards that the skilled person must precisely adjust the said reactor configuration so that the claimed pressure difference arises in order to solve the posed technical problem.

6.4.14 The Board also believes that the presence of an inventive step should be recognized regardless of the selection of the closest prior art, as the claimed process also differs from the processes according to the documents proposed by the appellant at least by the same feature as from the process according to document D11.

7. Therefore, none of the reasons presented in the appeal proceedings preclude the maintenance of the contested patent based on the present main request.

The submitted auxiliary requests can therefore be disregarded.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",opposition rejected,opposition rejected,appeal dismissed,Josef Meissner GmbH & Co,Josef Meissner GmbH & Co Bayenthalgürtel 16-20 D-50968 Köln / DE,"Strehlke, Ingo Kurt Von Rohr Patentanwälte Partnerschaft mbB Rüttenscheider Straße 62 45130 Essen / DE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeal of the appellant (opponent) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to maintain the patent EP 2 598 435 in amended form under Article 101(3)(a) EPC.

III. In the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged under Articles 100(a) and 100(b) EPC for lack of novelty, lack of inventive step, and lack of sufficiency of disclosure.

In the contested decision, the opposition division concluded that the claims of the amended main request met the requirements of Articles 123, 83, and 84 EPC. Novelty over the cited documents D7, D8, and D10 was established, and the claims were also found to involve an inventive step based on D4 or D5 as the closest prior art.

IV. In the statement of appeal and in the further proceedings, the appellant essentially argued that the subject matter of the claims in the maintained version was not novel over D7, D8, and in particular D10, which showed two embodiments that fell within the claims. Furthermore, the claimed compositions, both according to the maintained version and all auxiliary requests submitted in the proceedings, were suggested to the skilled person starting from D4 or D5 in combination with D7 or D8. Also, starting from D10, the claims of all requests lacked inventive step. Moreover, some of the auxiliary requests, particularly auxiliary request 1, should not be admitted into the proceedings as they were late and violated Rule 80 EPC.

The objection raised in the opposition proceedings under Article 83 EPC was not pursued further in the appeal proceedings and is not the subject of the appeal.

V. The respondent presented in its response to the appeal and in the further proceedings essentially that the cited embodiments of D10 did not disclose the polymer with thickening properties defined in claim 1 of the maintained version. Likewise, D7 or D8 did not anticipate the claim in a novelty-destroying manner. A skilled person would not have combined the teachings of D7/D8 with D4/D5 and would therefore not have arrived at the subject matter of the claim in an obvious manner starting from these documents. D10 was unsuitable as the closest prior art. The content of the claims of the patent in the maintained version, and even more so that of the auxiliary requests, was therefore novel and inventive over the cited prior art. Furthermore, although auxiliary requests 1-6 were only submitted with the letter of January 16, 2020, auxiliary requests 1-4 contained only insignificant corrections compared to their version from the opposition proceedings, which was referenced in the response to the appeal.

VI. By summons dated October 8, 2019, the parties were summoned to an oral hearing on June 18, 2020. The hearing date was subsequently postponed to May 18, 2021, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

VII. The Board issued a communication on November 5, 2019, under Article 15(1) RPBA, informing the parties of its preliminary assessment of the factual and legal situation. The Board was of the preliminary opinion that novelty over D7 and D8 was given. The novelty of the main request over D10 was questionable; this point needed to be discussed at the hearing. Inventive step starting from D4/D5 would also be subject to discussion.

VIII. The oral hearing took place on May 18, 2020, conducted as a video conference with the consent of the parties due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

IX. The arguments presented by the parties on the issues relevant to the decision are detailed and addressed in the reasons for the decision.

X. The final requests of the parties were as follows:

The appellant (opponent) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of European patent No. 2 598 435.

The respondent (patent proprietor) requested the dismissal of the appeal or, alternatively, the maintenance of the patent based on one of auxiliary requests 1 to 6, submitted with the letter of January 16, 2020.

XI. Claim 1 of the main request reads:

1. The appeal is admissible.

Main Request

2. Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

2.1 D10 discloses aqueous bleaching compositions. The examples V and VIII in the table on pages 10 and 11 contain hydrogen peroxide, water, and 2-hydroxypyridine-N-oxide, a compound according to formula (I) of the present claims in tautomeric notation. This corresponds to the present claim features a), b), and d).

Furthermore, these compositions contain a polymer referred to as MA/AA, which according to the legend of the table is a copolymer of maleic and acrylic acid (MA/AA) with a molecular weight of approximately 70,000.

This was undisputed.

2.2 The dispute was whether this polymer constitutes a polymer with thickening properties in the sense of feature c) of the claim.

2.2.1 The appellant referred to the patent itself, which in paragraph [0017] describes which polymers are to be understood as polymers with thickening properties in the sense of the claim. This includes such polymers that have a molecular weight above 5,000 g/mol and cause an approximately 30% increase in the viscosity of the described aqueous solutions at a weight proportion of up to 30%. According to paragraph [0020], these are particularly polymers based on acrylic acid. The MA/AA copolymer with a molecular weight of 70,000 is therefore a polymer with thickening properties. The thickening properties of such a polymer are also demonstrated in test report D13.

2.2.2 The respondent argued that not all acrylate polymers have thickening properties. This depends on the solubility of the polymer and the pH of the composition, as described in paragraph [0003] of the patent. D10 does not specify which polymer is used, so the data in D13 are not meaningful; it is not clear whether the same polymer was used in D13 as in D10. D10 does not mention any thickening properties of the polymer. It is not the respondent's burden to prove that such properties are actually absent; rather, the burden of proof lies with the appellant. As a result, D10 does not contain a clear and direct disclosure of a composition according to claim 1.

2.2.3 In the chamber's view, D10 does indeed disclose compositions as claimed in a direct and unambiguous manner. The MA/AA copolymers in examples V and VIII are polymers with thickening properties according to claim 1 of the main request.

The appellant rightly pointed out that MA/AA polymers as described in D10 fall under the generic definition of thickening polymers in the patent itself, see paragraph [0017]. Any contrary assertion by the respondent would have needed to be substantiated by data or convincing arguments. Furthermore, it was shown in D13 that a two percent solution of such a polymer in a composition corresponding to the examples of D10 leads to an increase in viscosity of about 80%.

The respondent's assertion that it is unclear which polymer was used in D10 is unconvincing. The appellant has demonstrated in D13 that an MA/AA copolymer with a molecular weight of 70,000 has thickening properties. In this respect, the appellant has fulfilled its burden of proof. The claim that some MA/AA copolymers with the disclosed molecular weight might not exhibit thickening properties is an unsubstantiated assertion by the respondent. They would have been obliged to prove that this situation could exist in D10.

The respondent's reference to the problematic thickening properties of polyacrylates in acidic environments described in paragraph [0003] of the patent is already irrelevant because the present claim does not define a pH value at which such properties would need to exist. Moreover, the tested compositions in D13 have a slightly acidic pH of about 6, just like the corresponding example V in D10, which evidently does not hinder thickening of the solutions.

2.2.4 The parties disagreed on whether the MA/AA copolymer disclosed in D10 corresponds to the branded product Sokalan CP5, which is mentioned in D10 on page 5, lines 34/35 as a particularly preferred MA/AA copolymer. For this polymer, the data sheet D12 describes that it has thickening properties. However, since novelty must already be denied for the present claim for the reasons stated above, this is irrelevant for the decision.

2.3 Claim 1 of the main request is therefore not novel over D10. The other novelty objections raised against D7 and D8 can thus be disregarded.

Auxiliary Request 1

3. Admissibility

3.1 The appellant pointed out that auxiliary request 1 in its current form was only submitted on January 16, 2020. In particular, compared to the version of the first auxiliary request submitted during the opposition proceedings, which the respondent referred to in the response to the appeal, dependent claim 15 was amended. The quantity specification of component d) was changed from 0.1 ppm to 2 wt.% to 1 to 100 ppm, in order to remain within the range defined in claim 1.

The appellant therefore considered that auxiliary request 1 was late and should not be admitted under Article 12(4) RPBA 2007.

Furthermore, an amendment only in a dependent claim to remedy a clarity defect under Rule 80 EPC is not permitted, as this does not eliminate any ground for opposition.

3.2 The chamber cannot agree with this submission.

3.2.1 Article 12(4) RPBA 2007 gives the chamber discretion to not admit requests that could have been submitted during the opposition proceedings or were not admitted there.

In the present case, it appears that in the auxiliary request 1 submitted during the opposition proceedings, dependent claim 15 was not adjusted to the amended claim 1. This was not noticed by either party or the opposition division; the request was ultimately not relevant for the decision in the opposition proceedings. The chamber sees no problem in rectifying this omission in the appeal proceedings, as it does not change the substance of the request.

3.2.2 Rule 80 EPC relates to amendments of the granted patent in opposition proceedings and is also applicable in appeal proceedings according to Rule 100(1) EPC. It governs the admissibility of amendments to the patent in opposition or opposition appeal proceedings. Amendments to the patent are permissible as long as they are prompted by a ground for opposition, even if this was not raised by the opponent.

In comparison to the granted patent, claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 introduces a limitation by defining the proportion of component d). Furthermore, the second independent claim 20 was also limited by introducing a reference back to compositions of claim 1. These limitations of the independent claims are prompted by a ground for opposition, namely lack of novelty under Article 100(a) EPC, and are therefore admissible. It is self-evident that dependent claims must be adjusted accordingly, otherwise the patent could not be maintained under Article 101(3)(a) EPC. According to G 3/14 (OJ 2015, A102), such a contradiction arising from the amendment of only the main claim would be a clarity defect that should be examined and, if necessary, remedied in the opposition proceedings.

Rule 80 EPC governs the relationship between the granted patent and amendments made in opposition proceedings, not the relationship between different amended versions among themselves. Therefore, Rule 80 EPC does not preclude the admissibility of the submitted first auxiliary request.

3.3 Auxiliary request 1 is therefore admitted into the proceedings.

4. Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 requires that component d) of the composition, i.e., the compound of formula (I), is present in amounts of 0.5 to 1000 ppm based on the total weight of the composition.

In examples V and VIII of D10, 2-hydroxypyridine-N-oxide is present in each case in an amount of 0.5 wt.%, corresponding to 5000 ppm.

The appellant stated in the oral proceedings that there are no novelty objections against auxiliary request 1, and the chamber sees none either.

Novelty is therefore given.

5. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

The patent addresses the problem of producing storage-stable thickened peroxide bleaches, see for example paragraphs [0009] to [0011] of the description. It aims to avoid a significant decrease in the viscosity of the formulations over time.

5.1 Closest Prior Art

In the opposition proceedings, D4 and D5 were considered the closest prior art. Both D4 (see for example paragraph [0017]) and D5 (see for example column 4, ""Summary of the invention"") deal with the stabilization of thickened peroxide solutions and thus with the same problem as the patent. Both are therefore suitable as the closest prior art.

The appellant also cited D10 as the closest prior art, as D10 is novelty-destroying for the claims of the main request. However, D10 does not mention the problem of the stability of thickened solutions; the thickening of the solutions is only implicitly disclosed. Therefore, D10 would not have been chosen by a skilled person as a starting point for the problem defined in the patent.

The difference between the claimed compositions compared to those of D4 and D5 was undisputed and lies in the use of 2-hydroxypyridine-N-oxide as component d) as stabilizers. The compositions of D4 use a system of stannates, phosphates, and aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds for this purpose (see claim 1), which may also include 2-hydroxypyridines (see paragraph [0027]). These stabilizers lead to rheological stabilization (see examples). D5 uses substituted aromatics as stabilizers (see for example claim 1).

5.2 Objective and Solution

5.2.1 Regarding the technical problem solved by the claimed compositions starting from D4/D5, the parties had differing opinions. The respondent believed that the claimed compositions are less toxic compared to those of D4/D5 and have increased rheological stability. In contrast, the appellant argued that such improved properties were not demonstrated and that the technical problem was merely to find alternative stabilized compositions.

The chamber follows the appellant in this respect, as it also does not see any improved properties caused by the use of the claimed stabilizers compared to D4/D5 as proven. There are no conclusive comparative tests; the opposition division also arrived at this conclusion (see point 5.3 of the contested decision). The technical problem can initially only be seen as finding alternative rheologically stabilized compositions starting from D4/D5. Since, as will be explained below, the claimed solution to this problem was not obvious, a detailed justification for the insufficient demonstration of improved properties compared to D4/D5 is not necessary.

In summary, the technical problem starting from D4/D5 was to seek alternative rheologically stabilized thickened hydrogen peroxide-containing compositions.

5.2.2 The appellant had disputed in its written submissions that this problem was solved. It particularly disputed that the data in the patent achieve a rheological stabilization of the compositions over the claimed range. It argued that all examples in the patent relate to solutions with 5.8 to 6.7 wt.% hydrogen peroxide and a viscosity of 1320 to 15700 mPa·s; no data are available outside these ranges. It is also not credible that a rheological stabilization is achieved for all possible polymers, which have different chemical and physical properties. Referring to its test report D14, it argued that a proportion of 5 ppm 2-hydroxypyridine-N-oxide has no influence on the rheological stability of xanthan-thickened compositions. Moreover, no stabilizing effect of the compounds (I) regarding the content of hydrogen peroxide was demonstrated.

The chamber does not follow this submission. As correctly pointed out by the respondent, the examples illustrate the effect of the claimed 2-hydroxypyridine-N-oxides on various thickening polymers of different chemical nature (associative thickeners, sulfonated acrylates, xanthan, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycol). In all cases, a reduction in the viscosity decrease during storage was observed compared to the unstabilized composition, while the concentration of hydrogen peroxide remained essentially constant. The assertion that a rheological stabilization of compositions containing other than the tested polymers or other concentrations of hydrogen peroxide would not occur is an unsubstantiated claim by the appellant. Although test report D14 indeed shows no positive influence of the presence of 5 ppm 2-hydroxypyridine-N-oxide on the viscosity of the composition after 12 days under the chosen conditions, the respondent rightly pointed out that under the chosen experimental conditions, no degradation of the polymer occurs, as the viscosity of the unstabilized composition also remains constant. This is therefore not an indication of a lack of effectiveness of the stabilizer.

The technical problem of seeking alternative rheologically stabilized thickened hydrogen peroxide-containing compositions was therefore solved by the claimed compositions, which are characterized by the use of the 2-hydroxypyridine-N-oxides referred to as component d) in the claimed amounts.

5.3 Obviousness of the Solution

5.3.1 The appellant argued that the use of the compounds (I) was suggested by the prior art.

Very similar rheological stabilizers, such as 6-hydroxypicolinic acid, are already disclosed in D4 (see paragraph [0027]). A skilled person would have had to make only minor structural changes to arrive at the claimed compounds (I).

In D7, N-hydroxypyridones of formula (I), particularly the tautomer 2-hydroxypyridine-N-oxide, are mentioned on page 5. The same applies to D8 (page 19), where these compounds are referred to as stabilizers. Both documents concern thickened hydrogen peroxide solutions. A skilled person would therefore have known that these compounds could be used as stabilizers for such compositions, especially since the phosphonate DEQUEST is described in both D7 (page 5) and D4 (paragraph [0024]). Starting from D4/D5, they would therefore have used compounds (I) according to claim 1 as an alternative to the rheological stabilizers used in D4/D5.

5.3.2 In contrast, the respondent argued that a skilled person would not have combined D4/D5 with D7/D8. There would be no motivation to transfer individual features from D7 and D8 to the teaching of D4/D5.

5.3.3 It is correct that D4 describes pyridine derivatives, such as 2-hydroxypicolinic acid, as rheological stabilizers. However, a skilled person would not have found any indication in D4 that corresponding N-oxides are also suitable for this purpose. Therefore, the claimed compositions are not suggested by D4 alone.

5.3.4 D7 deals with aqueous solutions of hydrogen bleaches for stain removal, which are to be chemically stable and enable effective disinfection (page 2, second and third full paragraphs). These compositions contain a peroxide bleach, a radical scavenger, a buffer, and a chelating agent (see ""Summary of the invention"" on pages 3 and 4). Compounds (I) are chelating agents that contribute to the chemical stability of the peroxide-containing compositions (pages 5 and 6). The compositions of D7 may also contain thickening polymers as an optional component (see page 17 bottom to page 19).

However, nowhere in D7 is it described, let alone substantiated by data, that the chelating agents described there, such as 2-hydroxypyridine-N-oxide or similar compounds of formula (I), stabilize the compositions rheologically; the examples contain neither thickening polymers nor compounds (I). Although it is stated that these compounds are supposed to improve the chemical stability of the compositions, as pointed out by the appellant, the chemical stability is only mentioned in connection with peroxides (page 6, first full paragraph), and the last sentence of the description on page 24 makes it clear that by chemical stability, the stability of the peroxide is meant (""oxygen loss""). Maintenance of viscosity, if the compositions contain a thickening polymer at all, is not addressed in D7. A skilled person had no information from D7 that compounds (I) are suitable for the rheological stabilization of thickened hydrogen peroxide-containing compositions. The mention of the phosphonates DEQUEST in D7 and in D4 does not allow any conclusions about the effect of compounds (I) without knowledge of the patent in dispute.

5.3.5 The same applies to D8, which discloses peroxide bleaching for carpet cleaning (page 4, ""Summary of the invention""). These compositions are applied from a container as a spray. The compositions may contain polymers (pages 9ff.), for example MA/AA (page 10 bottom), which serve to suspend dirt particles and enhance the cleaning effect by preventing the formation of sticky residues on the carpets (page 12 first full paragraph). 2-hydroxypyridine-N-oxides and other compounds of formula (I) are mentioned on pages 19ff in the chapter on stabilizers, alongside other substances referred to as chelating agents. Nothing is disclosed about the effect of these compounds; viscosity and its maintenance are not a topic in D8. That compounds (I) contribute to the rheological stabilization of the composition is not described in D8.

5.3.6 If a skilled person were faced with the task of finding alternative rheologically stable compositions starting from D4/D5, they would turn to documents that address rheological stability in some way. They might then add individual components described in such documents as useful for maintaining rheological stability to the compositions from D4/D5 or replace corresponding components.

In the present case, however, the documents cited by the appellant, D7 and D8, do not mention the problem of rheological stability that is of interest to the skilled person at all. There is no discussion of viscosity fluctuations during storage, and how these might be prevented.

A skilled person therefore had no reason to refer to these documents to solve the task at hand. The mere fact that, as argued by the appellant, the documents lie in the same or a similar technical field, namely peroxide-containing compositions, is not sufficient. The skilled person is indeed looking for the solution to a specific problem, namely to keep thickened solutions rheologically stable, and is searching for documents that will help them solve this problem. Since D7 or D8 do not address the problem of interest to the skilled person, they do not provide any hints for its solution.

5.4 In summary, it can be stated that a skilled person starting from D4/D5 would not have consulted documents D7/D8 to solve the technical problem posed, and even if they had, these would not have provided any hints towards the claimed solution.

Inventive step is therefore present.

Furthermore, objections were raised under Article 100(b) EPC for lack of sufficiency of disclosure and under Article 100(c) EPC for unauthorized amendments.

III. In the opposition proceedings, the patent holder defended the patent in amended versions. The final main request was submitted during the oral proceedings. In its decision, the opposition division concluded that the claims of this main request had become unclear due to the amendments made (Article 84 EPC). Referring to decision G 3/14, the request to maintain the patent on this basis was therefore not granted. An additional auxiliary request submitted during the oral proceedings was not admitted into the proceedings. The patent was revoked.

IV. In her statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant argued that the objection of the opposition division under Article 84 EPC against the claims of the main request was unfounded. Furthermore, she submitted a new auxiliary request in which the feature causing the alleged lack of clarity was deleted. She requested that the proceedings be referred back to the opposition division for further decision based on the claims of the main request, or alternatively, based on the auxiliary request.

V. In her response to the appeal, the respondent (opponent) argued that neither the main request nor the auxiliary request of the appellant should be admitted into the appeal proceedings. The claims of the main request were unclear, as determined by the opposition decision. Furthermore, both requests did not meet other requirements of the EPC, in particular, the claims had been amended in an unauthorized manner (Article 123(2) EPC), the invention was not sufficiently disclosed (Article 83 EPC), and the claimed compositions did not involve an inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

VI. In a communication pursuant to Rule 100(2) EPC dated August 12, 2020, the board communicated its preliminary opinion on the factual and legal situation to the parties. It stated, among other things, that in its view, the main request of the appellant should be admitted into the proceedings, while the auxiliary request should not. The clarity objection raised against the main request in the opposition decision appeared to be justified. The other points addressed in this communication are not relevant for the decision.

VII. In a letter dated December 9, 2020, the respondent reiterated her objections under Articles 123(2), 123(3), and 56 EPC.

VIII. In a letter dated December 11, 2020, the appellant withdrew her request for oral proceedings made in the statement of grounds of appeal and did not present any further arguments.

IX. The final requests of the parties are as follows:

The appellant requests that the contested decision be overturned. She further requests that the case be referred back to the opposition division for further decision based on the claims of the main request underlying the contested decision (resubmitted with the statement of grounds of appeal), or alternatively, based on the auxiliary request submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal.

The respondent requests that the appeal be dismissed. In particular, she requests that neither the main request nor the auxiliary request of the appellant be admitted into the appeal proceedings. Alternatively, she requests oral proceedings.

X. Claim 1 of the request underlying this decision reads:

""Alkyl benzoate mixture comprising esters of benzoic acid having the general formula (I),

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

wherein R is an aliphatic linear alkyl group with C4 to C22 carbon atoms, with the sum of the C12 and C14 alkyl benzoates being greater than or equal to 85 wt.-% based on the total sum of the alkyl benzoates, and the alkyl benzoates having the following C chain distribution:

(a) C-12 alkyl benzoates greater than or equal to 60 wt.-%, preferably greater than or equal to 65 wt.-%, in particular greater than or equal to 70 wt.-%, and

(b) C-14 alkyl benzoates between 20 wt.-% and 40 wt.-%, in particular between 20 wt.-% and 35 wt.-%, preferably between 25 wt.-% and 30 wt.-%, based on the total sum of the alkyl benzoates.""

Claim 1 of the first auxiliary request reads:

""Alkyl benzoate mixture, wherein the sum of the C12 and C14 alkyl benzoates is greater than or equal to 85 wt.-% based on the total sum of the alkyl benzoates, and the alkyl benzoates having the following C chain distribution:

(a) C-12 alkyl benzoates greater than or equal to 60 wt.-%, preferably greater than or equal to 65 wt.-%, in particular greater than or equal to 70 wt.-%, and

(b) C-14 alkyl benzoates between 20 wt.-% and 40 wt.-%, in particular between 20 wt.-% and 35 wt.-%, preferably between 25 wt.-% and 30 wt.-%, based on the total sum of the alkyl benzoates.""","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible. The admissibility of the appeal has not been contested.

2. A request for oral proceedings has only been submitted by the respondent, and only in the event that the appeal is not dismissed. However, since this is the case, as explained further below, a decision in written proceedings is permissible.

Main Request

3. Admissibility

The respondent argued that the main request of the appellant was submitted only during the oral proceedings before the opposition division and should not have been admitted into the proceedings by them. Therefore, it should also not be admitted into the appeal proceedings.

The Board cannot agree with this. The main request was submitted during the oral proceedings before the opposition division and was admitted into the proceedings by them in the exercise of their discretion. It forms the basis of the contested decision.

The opposition division has discretion under Rule 116 EPC to admit amended documents of the patent proprietor into the proceedings even after the time limit set in this rule. In the present case, they exercised their discretion to admit the request. It has not been argued, nor is it immediately apparent, that the opposition division violated fundamental procedural rules in exercising this discretion, such as the right to be heard of the opponent under Article 113 EPC.

The main request is therefore part of the appeal proceedings.

4. Clarity (Article 84 EPC)

4.1 According to G 3/14 (OJ EPO 2015, A102), in opposition proceedings, the claims of the amended version of the patent granted are only subject to a clarity examination to the extent that the amendment itself causes a clarity deficiency. The claims in the granted form are exempt from a clarity examination, as lack of clarity is not a ground for opposition, Article 100 EPC.

In the present case, the claims have been amended compared to the granted version in that they are now directed to alkyl benzoates, ""comprising esters of benzoic acid with the general formula (I), wherein R is an aliphatic linear alkyl group with C4 to C22 carbon atoms.""

The clarity examination is therefore limited to aspects that have newly arisen due to the introduction of this feature.

4.2 The granted claim 1 related to alkyl benzoate mixtures in which the sum of C12 and C14 alkyl benzoates constitutes at least 85% by weight of all alkyl benzoates. The granted claim 4 further defined a distribution within these C12 and C14 alkyl benzoates.

In the amended version of the main request, the alkyl benzoates were restricted to those of formula (I) that contain linear residues R. However, the formulation of the claim stating that the alkyl benzoates ""comprise"" such compounds is unclear as to whether the remaining restrictions on the proportions of C12 and C14 alkyl benzoates apply to all alkyl benzoates or only to those of formula (I).

Claim 1 does not contain a reference of the quantity indications to formula (I); therefore, the quantity indications could generally refer to all existing alkyl benzoates. On the other hand, the quantity indications of C12 and C14 alkyl benzoates directly follow the definition of the linear C4-C22 alkyl residues, and moreover, the term ""C12-alkyl benzoates"" is defined in paragraphs [0010] and [0012] of the description as compounds of formula (I), even though there is no restriction to linear residues. It is therefore quite unclear to which type of alkyl benzoates the quantity limitations in the claim refer.

The opposition division has stated this in point 15 of their decision and recognized a lack of clarity caused by the introduced amendment. The Board agrees with this assessment for the reasons stated above.

4.3 The appellant argued that the claim is clear since the quantity indications do not contain a reference to formula (I).

The Board cannot agree with this. The claim can be read in two ways. The defined ""sum of C12 and C14 alkyl benzoates"" could generally refer to all possible alkyl benzoates, or it could refer to the directly previously defined compounds (I) with linear alkyl residues with C4 to C22 carbon atoms. The absence of a direct reference would support the first reading. The fact that the quantity indication directly follows the definition of the linear alkyl residues and the statement in the description in paragraphs [0010] and [0012], that alkyl benzoates are those of formula (I), even if there is no restriction to linear residues, would support the second reading.

4.4 Furthermore, the appellant argued that even if two interpretations of the claim are possible, this does not constitute a clarity issue, as it only involves a broader and a narrower interpretation of the claim.

The Board cannot agree with this either.

According to Article 84 EPC, the claims must clearly define the subject matter for which protection is sought. If a skilled person cannot determine how a feature (in this case, the quantity indications of C12 and C14 alkyl benzoates) limits a claim due to various possible interpretations of the claim, such a claim cannot be granted under Article 84 EPC.

4.5 The patent cannot therefore be maintained on the basis of the main request.

Auxiliary Request

5. Admissibility

5.1 The admissibility of the auxiliary request is governed by the transitional provisions in Article 25 of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA) 2020 according to Article 12(4) RPBA 2007. The auxiliary request was submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal. According to Article 12(4) RPBA 2007, it is at the discretion of the Board to not admit requests into the appeal proceedings that could have been presented during the opposition proceedings.

5.2 Claim 1 of the auxiliary request is a combination of the granted claims 1 and 4. It does not contain any restriction regarding the presence of compounds (I) with linear aliphatic alkyl residues.

The restriction to compounds (I) with linear aliphatic alkyl residues was a consistent part of the appellant's submissions in the opposition proceedings. Both the main request in the opposition response dated January 19, 2017, and the later sets of claims submitted on July 28, 2017, as well as during the oral proceedings, included this restriction. This feature was consistently the subject of discussion in the opposition proceedings, as the appellant defended novelty and inventive step based on this feature.

The Board believes that a request that removes a restrictive feature introduced at the beginning of the opposition proceedings and consistently maintained from the main claim, thereby rendering the submissions of the parties in the opposition proceedings and the opposition decision largely obsolete, cannot be submitted for the first time in the appeal proceedings. Such a request should have been submitted during the opposition proceedings.

5.3 The non-admission of the auxiliary request was announced in the Board's communication pursuant to Rule 100(2) EPC. The appellant has not presented any arguments on this point either in the statement of grounds of appeal or thereafter.

5.4 The auxiliary request is therefore not admitted into the appeal proceedings.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,INNOSPEC LIMITED,"INNOSPEC LIMITED Innospec Manufacturing Park Oil Sites Road Ellesmere Port, Cheshire CH65 4EY / GB","Appleyard Lees IP LLP, et al, et al 15 Clare Road Halifax HX1 2HY / GB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The present decision concerns the appeal of the patent holder (appellant) against the decision of the opposition division (challenged decision) regarding the revocation of European Patent No. 2 247 577 (patent in dispute).

II. In the opposition proceedings, the opponent (respondent) requested the revocation of the patent in dispute in its entirety based on the grounds for opposition according to Article 100 a) EPC (lack of novelty and lack of inventive step), Article 100 b) EPC, and Article 100 c) EPC.

D9    Experimental Description (submitted by the

respondent with their submission of

August 23, 2017)

IV. The challenged decision is based on the set of claims of the main request submitted with the letter dated March 13, 2017, and the sets of claims of auxiliary requests 1 and 2 submitted with the letter dated August 23, 2017. The opposition division particularly decided that the subject matter of the main request does not involve an inventive step over a combination of D8 with D4 and/or D6.

V. In relation to an auxiliary request submitted by the appellant during the appeal proceedings, both parties submitted further documents. However, these are not relevant to the present decision, as the claims of the main request are allowable (see below).

VI. Upon request, both parties were summoned to an oral hearing. In preparation for this, the board issued a communication pursuant to Article 15 (1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal 2020.

Subsequently, both parties withdrew their auxiliary request for an oral hearing and announced that they would not attend the oral hearing. The board then canceled the scheduled date for the oral hearing.

VII. The requests relevant to the present decision are as follows.

The appellant requests the annulment of the challenged decision and the maintenance of the patent in dispute in amended form based on the set of claims of the main request submitted with the letter dated March 13, 2017.

The respondent requests the dismissal of the appeal.

VIII. The arguments of the appellant relevant to the present decision can be summarized as follows.

As already stated in the challenged decision, the amendments in the claims of the main request are allowable. Furthermore, the subject matter of the main request is sufficiently disclosed and novel.

D3 is the closest prior art. The subject matter of claim 1 differs from D3 in that the acrylic acid derivative of formula (II) has a different leaving group A and that it is reacted not with a hydrazine but with the N-alkyl-hydrazone of formula (III) in claim 1. The objective technical problem must be seen in finding alternative access routes to the desired compounds. The compounds reacted with hydrazones in D4 and D6 are structurally different from those reacted with hydrazines in D3. Thus, the skilled person could not have assumed that the hydrazines in the reaction described in D3 could be replaced by the hydrazones described in D4 or D6. Therefore, the subject matter of the claims of the main request involves an inventive step.

IX. The arguments of the respondent relevant to the present decision can be summarized as follows.

The definitions of the residues R**(8) and R**(9) in the claims of the main request would, contrary to the originally submitted documents, include hydrogen. Furthermore, the definitions of the leaving group A and the residue R**(1) have been restricted. Overall, the claims of the main request would therefore impermissibly be based on a selection from at least two lists. Additionally, in contrast to the corresponding original claims, the residue R**(9) is now defined in claims 11 and 12 of the main request. The residues R**(9), R**(10), and R**(11) in claim 13 of the main request are also indefinite. The requirements of Article 123 (2) EPC are therefore not fulfilled.

The group X is not defined in the residues Y and Z in claims 1 to 13 of the main request. Furthermore, a technical teaching described as essential in the priority application is not included in the patent in dispute. The invention of claims 1 to 13 is therefore not executable across the entire claimed range. This is also confirmed by the experiments in D9.

The subject matter of claims 1, 11, and 12 is not novel over D8.

The subject matter of claims 1 to 13 does not involve an inventive step starting from D3 or D8 as the closest prior art in combination with D4 and/or D6.","Reasons for the Decision

3. Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

3.1 Claim 1

Compared to the application in its originally filed version (hereinafter ""original application""), specifically its claim 1, the definitions of the leaving group A and the residues R**(1), R**(8), and R**(9) have been changed in claim 1 of the main request.

These changes affect steps (A) or (B) and (C) in different ways. In step (A), both reactants are affected, namely the acrylic acid derivative of formula (II) containing the leaving group A and the N-alkyl hydrazone of formula (III) containing residues R**(1), R**(8), and R**(9). In contrast, in steps (B) and (C), only one of the two reactants is affected, namely the acrylic acid hydrazone of formula (VI) containing residues R**(1), R**(8), and R**(9). Therefore, steps (A) or (B) and (C) are considered separately.

3.1.1 Step (A)

The broader definition of the leaving group A contained in the original claim 1

""A is a leaving group selected from OR**(12), SR**(12), NR**(12)R**(13), wherein R**(12) and R**(13) are independently selected from [...]""

has been restricted in claim 1 of the main request to

""A is a leaving group NR**(12)R**(13), wherein R**(12) and R**(13) are independently selected from [...]"".

Since the definitions of the residues R**(12) and R**(13) contained in the leaving group NR**(12)R**(13) have not been changed, the leaving group A in claim 1 of the main request is still generically defined.

Regarding the N-alkyl hydrazone of formula (III) and the residues R**(1), R**(8), and R**(9) contained therein, the original application initially discloses a general form (page 16, lines 11 to 27) and directly thereafter a preferred embodiment (page 16, line 28 to page 17, line 7). The original claim 1 is directed to the general embodiment. In claim 1 of the main request, this has been replaced by the preferred embodiment. Although the preferred embodiment is broader in that it includes the additional possibility that R**(8) and/or R**(9) can be hydrogen atoms, the context established in the original application between both embodiments provides a sufficient basis for replacing the general embodiment contained in the original claim 1 with the preferred embodiment that it does not fully encompass. The opponent's argument that claim 1 of the main request includes this possibility, while the original claim 1 does not, resulting in an impermissible amendment, is therefore unconvincing.

In summary, in step (A) of claim 1 of the main request, the generic definition contained in the original claim 1 for the leaving group A is merely restricted in scope but remains generic in nature. Furthermore, the replacement of the definitions for residues R**(1), R**(8), and R**(9) in the original claim 1 with those in claim 1 of the main request can be directly and immediately derived from the original application. In particular, the definitions for R**(1), R**(8), and R**(9) included in claim 1 of the main request remain generic and, together with the change made to the leaving group A, do not lead to a ""singling-out"" of certain (not otherwise disclosed) combinations. The changes made in step (A) of claim 1 of the main request are therefore allowable in light of Article 123(2) EPC.

3.1.2 Steps (B) and (C)

As stated in the previous point, for the N-alkyl hydrazone of formula (III), the combination of definitions for R**(1), R**(8), and R**(9) contained in claim 1 of the main request is disclosed as preferred in the original application. Although the original application does not provide definitions for R**(1), R**(8), and R**(9) regarding the acrylic acid hydrazone of formula (VI), it refers to the fact that this can be obtained from the N-alkyl hydrazone of formula (III) (page 20, f., Schemes 7 and 8). The skilled person would deduce from this that the preferred combination of definitions for R**(1), R**(8), and R**(9) for the N-alkyl hydrazone of formula (III) is also preferred for the acrylic acid hydrazone of formula (VI). This implies, for example, that for the acrylic acid hydrazone of formula (VI), there is also the possibility that R**(8) and/or R**(9) can be hydrogen atoms. Contrary to the argument presented by the opponent in this context (see above), this is entirely consistent with the rest of the disclosure of the original application, as it mentions among the acrylic acid hydrazones of formula (VI) designated as preferred on page 18, lines 8 ff. and page 22, lines 1 ff. those that contain a 1-methyl-2-(phenylmethylidene)hydrazinyl group in the molecule, where R**(8)/R**(9) = Ph/H. For steps (B) and (C), the changes made can therefore be directly and immediately derived from the original application.

3.2 Further Claims

Claims 2 to 10 are based on claims 2 to 10 of the original application. The list of acrylic acid derivatives of formula (II) in original claim 8 has been restricted in claim 8 of the main request to those for which A = NR**(12)R**(13).

Claims 11 and 12 are based on original claims 11 and 12. The fact that R**(9) is not defined in original claims 11 and 12, but is now stated to have ""the previously described meaning"" together with R**(1) and R**(8), does not go beyond the content of the original application, as the acrylic acid hydrazones of formulas (VII) (claim 11) and (VIIa) (claim 12) are formed from the N-alkyl hydrazones of formula (III) or the acrylic acid hydrazones of formula (VI), see Schemes 3, 4, 6 of the original application as well as page 14, lines 1 ff.

Claim 13 is based on original claim 13. The now additional specification of the ""anion**(-)"" and its definition is disclosed on page 14, lines 3 to 8 of the original application. The fact that in claim 13 the residues R**(9), R**(10), and R**(11) are undefined does not go beyond the subject matter of the original application, as this was already the case in original claim 13. For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that an objection in this regard under Article 84 EPC would be inadmissible, as claim 13 is identical to granted claim 14 (see G 3/14, OJ EPO 2015, A102, decision formula).

3.3 In summary, the claims of the main request meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

4. Disclosure of the Invention (Article 83 EPC)

4.1 The opponent argued that ""X"" in the variable groups Y and Z in claims 1-13 of the main request is not defined, which is why the subject matter of claims 1-13 of the main request is not executable across the entire claimed scope (Opponent's response, page 6, paragraph 3).

In claim 1, a definition of the group X occurs only in steps (B) and (C). However, the absence of such in step (A) cannot call into question the executability of the same, as the contested patent defines this group in paragraph [0020] as ""halogen,"" i.e., as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. This is, moreover, the same definition as in steps (B) and (C) in claim 1.

4.2 The opponent also referred to D9. The experiments described therein would demonstrate that the method according to claim 1, if it concerns step (A), is not executable across the entire breadth.

In D9, the reaction of 2-(difluoromethyl)-3-(pyrrolidine-1-yl)acrylic acid ethyl ester with the hydrazone formed from methylhydrazine and acetone is investigated. These reactants correspond to formulas (II) and (III) in claim 1 (Y = (C=O)OEt; A = pyrrolidine-1-yl; Z = O; R**(2) = CHF2; R**(1) = Me; R**(8) = R**(9) = Me). The formation of a 1-alkyl-3-haloalkyl-pyrazol-4-carboxylic acid derivative of formula (I) is observed only in small amounts and with low regioselectivity. Furthermore, the formation of an intermediate according to formula (VII) is not observed.

Now, claim 1 neither requires that a product according to formula (I) be obtained in a certain amount/yield nor that it must be formed with a certain regioselectivity. Claim 1 also does not require that an intermediate according to formula (VII) be formed. Paragraph [0047] of the contested patent rather indicates that these may be possible intermediates. Thus, the formation of a product according to formula (I) demonstrates that the method according to claim 1 is sufficiently disclosed.

Although claim 2 of the main request refers to the formation of an intermediate of formula (VII) (for the structure, see claim 11 above under point 2.2), the non-observation of such in D9 also cannot call into question the executability of the method according to claim 2. In example 1 of the contested patent, the reaction of 2-(difluoroacetyl)-3-(dimethylamino)acrylic acid ethyl ester with 2-methyl-1-phenylhydrazone is described, i.e., two compounds that also correspond to formulas (II) and (III) in claim 1 (Y = (C=O)OEt; A = NMe2; Z = O; R**(2) = CHF2; R**(1) = Me; R**(8)/R**(9) = H/Ph). The product depicted in paragraph [0103] of the contested patent, an intermediate according to formula (VII) in the contested patent (Scheme 3), is obtained from this reaction. In this context, the teaching of the contested patent is sufficient for the skilled person to obtain an intermediate according to formula (VII) without undue effort. If, as described in D9, other reactants do not seemingly react to form a corresponding intermediate, this cannot be readily concluded to indicate a lack of executability. Evidence of an undue burden for the skilled person would have been required, particularly evidence that the reaction of the reactants of D9 under the reaction conditions described in the contested patent would not have led to an intermediate according to formula (VII) - as the reaction conditions mentioned in the contested patent are fundamentally different from those in D9 (e.g., solvent: toluene in the contested patent vs. acetone in D9; catalyst: potassium hydrogen sulfate in the contested patent vs. none in D9; reaction temperature: 35-40 °C in the contested patent vs. room temperature in D9). There is therefore no reason to doubt that with these fundamentally different reaction conditions disclosed in the contested patent, the ""failure"" of D9 could have been avoided.

4.3 Finally, the opponent also pointed out that a technical teaching described as essential in the priority application is not contained in the contested patent, and that the method according to claim 1, if it concerns step (A), is not executable across the entire breadth.

The chamber cannot agree with this either. From the alleged fact that a technical teaching described as essential in a priority application is not contained in the subsequent application or the contested patent, one cannot necessarily conclude a lack of disclosure. For example, this technical teaching may have turned out to be incorrect or unnecessary at the time of filing the subsequent application or granting the contested patent. Furthermore, in the present case, the technical teaching of the priority application referred to by the opponent (paragraph [0042])

""A complete transamination of 2-acyl-3-amino-acrylic acid derivatives with hydrazones occurs only in the presence of catalysts [...] It should be noted that the reaction should take place as much as possible in the absence of water to prevent deacylation.""

does not allow the conclusion that carrying out the respective reaction without catalysts or in the presence of water would lead to no product at all.

4.4 In summary, the objections raised by the opponent under Article 83 EPC do not hold, and the chamber therefore considers the claimed invention of the main request to be sufficiently disclosed.

5. Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

The only novelty objection of the opponent was based on D8.

5.1 D8 discloses (page 5, line 24 to page 6, line 12):

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

According to D8, the hydrazine derivatives of the above formula (IV) are preferably methylhydrazine (R**(4) = Me; page 6, lines 23 to 26). D8 also discloses a list of possible aprotic solvents that can be used in the above reaction. Among these solvents, acetone is mentioned (page 7, lines 15 to 22). By way of example, D8 mentions the reaction of 2-(dichloroacetyl)-3-(dimethylamino)acrylic acid ethyl ester with methylhydrazine (page 6, line 28 to page 7, line 1):

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

5.2 The compound disclosed as formula (I) in the above passage of D8 corresponds to the 2-acylated acrylic acid derivative (II) required in step (A) of claim 1.

The product obtained, for example, by the reaction of 2-(dichloroacetyl)-3-(dimethylamino)acrylic acid ethyl ester with methylhydrazine in D8 corresponds to the pyrazole of formula (I) required in claim 1.

Nevertheless, the method of claim 1 differs from D8 in that, according to the claim, in step (A) an N-alkyl hydrazone (R**(9)R**(8))C=N-NH-R**(1) of formula (III) is used, while in D8 the hydrazine derivative R**(4)-NH-NH2 (IV) is used.

5.3 The opponent argued in this context that when carrying out the above reaction at a temperature of -50 to 0 °C and using the preferred methylhydrazine, a hydrazone according to formula (III) in claim 1 would inevitably be formed if acetone is chosen as the solvent. In particular, the hydrazone CH3-NH-N=C(CH3)2 would form from the hydrazine CH3-NH-NH2 and acetone (CH3)2(C=O). Thus, when choosing acetone as the solvent using the preferred methylhydrazine, a reaction would occur as described in claim 1. In addition to the method according to claim 1, this would also preemptively destroy the novelty of the compounds of claims 11 and 12.

The chamber cannot agree with this. The opponent's argument is based on the selection of acetone as the solvent and essentially relies on the assertion that at any reaction temperature, which must also be chosen from the temperature range disclosed in D8 of -50 to 0 °C,

a) the corresponding hydrazone is formed from methylhydrazine and acetone

b) the hydrazone formed in a) reacts with the compounds of formula (I) in D8, and

c) the intermediate obtained from b) is further cyclized to form compounds of formula (V) in D8.

The chamber acknowledges that methylhydrazine and acetone can react to form a corresponding hydrazone. However, it cannot be substantiated by a mere reference to general technical knowledge that they would do so readily at such low temperatures as, for example, -50 °C. Already regarding a), there are therefore legitimate doubts. Even if one assumes in favor of the opponent that the formation of the hydrazone would readily occur even at -50 °C, there would still be significant doubts regarding the subsequent reactions b) and c).

Regarding b): How would it be explained that at -50 °C the reactive methylhydrazine does not react with compounds of formula (I), but the hydrazone formed from methylhydrazine, which is less reactive than methylhydrazine, does?

Regarding c): Even if one further assumes that compounds of formula (I) react with the hydrazone formed from methylhydrazine and acetone at -50 °C, how would the final ring closure to the pyrazole be conceivable? For this ring closure, it is necessary that the hydrazine-NH2 group introduced into the molecule as a hydrazone is released again. However, if under the conditions of D8 a hydrazone is supposedly formed spontaneously (see a) above), why would its hydrolysis occur spontaneously?

For the reasons mentioned above, D8 does not disclose a method according to claim 1 or compounds according to claims 11 and 12 directly and unambiguously. The subject matter of claims 1, 11, and 12 is therefore novel over D8.

6. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

6.1 The opponent considered D3 or D8 as the closest prior art and argued that the claimed subject matter of the main request does not involve an inventive step over a combination of either of these documents with D4 and/or D6.

6.2 D8 as Closest Prior Art

6.2.1 Claims 1 to 10

As already noted above, the method according to claim 1 differs from the method disclosed in D8 (see, for example, the above-mentioned reaction of 2-(dichloroacetyl)-3-(dimethylamino)acrylic acid ethyl ester with methylhydrazine) only in that in step (A) the acrylic acid derivative of formula (II) is reacted with an N-alkyl hydrazone of formula (III) in claim 1 and not with a hydrazine according to formula (IV) in D8.

The contested decision, which the opponent referred to, states that the above distinguishing feature is not associated with any technical effect. In favor of the opponent, it is assumed that this is correct. The objective technical problem can therefore be seen as providing an alternative synthesis method for the pyrazole derivatives according to formula (I) in claim 1.

Regarding the obviousness, the opponent again referred to the contested decision. According to this, the skilled person could have derived from D4 and/or D6 that hydrazones are suitable for reactions with acrylic acid derivatives similar to hydrazines to obtain pyrazole compounds. The chamber cannot agree with this for the following reasons.

D4 discloses the reaction of the hydrazone (compound 16) formed from methylhydrazine and acetone with 3-ethoxymethylene-pentan-2,4-dione to form compound 17 (step ii). From the latter, the pyrazole 9e is obtained by reaction with HCl in ethanol (step iii):

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

Similarly, D6 discloses the reaction of the hydrazone formed from methylhydrazine (R = Me) and benzaldehyde with beta,beta-bis(trifluoroacetyl)vinyl-i-butylether (compound 1) to form compound 8. From this, the corresponding pyrazole 4a is obtained by reaction in aqueous trifluoroacetic acid:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

The above-described pyrazole syntheses of D4 and D6 are the only ones that start from hydrazones that are N-alkyl hydrazones according to formula (III) in claim 1 (D4: the hydrazone formed from methylhydrazine and acetone; D6: the hydrazone formed from methylhydrazine and benzaldehyde). It is noteworthy that their respective reaction partners, namely 3-ethoxymethylene-pentan-2,4-dione (D4) and beta,beta-bis(trifluoroacetyl)vinyl-i-butylether (D6, compound 1), fundamentally differ from the compounds that are reacted with hydrazines in D8. A significant difference is that the compounds of D4 and D6 are diketones, while those in D8 are beta-keto carboxylic acid esters. Furthermore, the compounds of D4 and D6 have entirely different leaving groups with alkoxy groups (D4: ethoxy; D6: i-butoxy) than the compounds of D8, which have amino groups. In this context, the skilled person could not have assumed that the reaction described in D8 with hydrazines could also be carried out in the same way with the hydrazones described in D4 and D6. Therefore, the subject matter of claim 1 and its dependent claims 2 to 10 involves an inventive step according to Article 56 EPC.

6.2.2 Claims 11 to 13

The subject matter of claims 11 to 13 relates to the acrylic acid hydrazones of formulas (VII), (VIIa), or (VIIb). Since these acrylic acid hydrazones represent intermediates that are accessible according to step (A) in claim 1, the above argumentation also applies correspondingly to the subject matter of these claims. Thus, starting from D8, the subject matter of claims 11 to 13 also involves an inventive step.

6.3 D3 as Closest Prior Art

D3 (claim 1) essentially relates to a method for producing 1-substituted 3-fluoroalkylpyrazol-4-carboxylates of the following formula (3)

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

by reacting 2-alkoxy-methylene-fluoroacylacetates of formula (1)

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

with hydrazines of the formula R**(5)NHNH2 (the exact meaning of the residues R**(1) to R**(5) is not relevant here).

The method according to claim 1 of the main request thus differs from D3 at least in that in step (A)

i) the acrylic acid derivative of formula (II) has a different leaving group (namely NR**(12)R**(13) instead of OR**(4), see compound of formula (1) in D3)

ii) the reaction in step (A) is carried out with an N-alkyl hydrazone of formula (III) and not with a hydrazine.

In favor of the opponent, it is assumed that the above distinguishing features are not associated with any technical effect and that consequently the objective technical problem is merely to provide an alternative synthesis method for the pyrazole derivatives according to formula (I) in claim 1.

To arrive at the subject matter of claim 1 starting from D3, the skilled person would first have had to replace the leaving group OR**(4) contained in the compounds of formula (1) in D3 with one that corresponds to the definition in claim 1 (i.e., NR**(12)R**(13)). Even if one assumes, again in favor of the opponent, that this is exactly what would have been done, the skilled person would still have faced the same situation as starting from D8, namely the assessment of a possible reaction of

- beta-keto carboxylic acid esters (see the structure of the compounds of formula (1) in D3) containing an amino group as a leaving group (see the mental exchange of the leaving group OR**(4) for a leaving group according to claim 1)

with

- the hydrazones of D4 and/or D6, which are reacted in those documents with entirely different compounds (see above).

For the reasons already stated above, the skilled person could not have assumed that such a reaction could be carried out. Therefore, the subject matter of claim 1 involves an inventive step. The above argumentation applies mutatis mutandis to the remaining claims 2 to 13 starting from D8.

6.4 In summary, the claimed subject matter of the main request involves an inventive step according to Article 56 EPC. The main request is allowable.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2.

I. The appeal of the appellant (opponent) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to maintain European Patent EP 2 070 907 in amended form under Article 101(3)(a) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged on the basis of Article 100(a) for lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC) and lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC), as well as under Article 100(b) and (c) EPC.

III. Among other things, the following documents were cited, which are also relevant for the present decision:

D1: EP 0 156 199 A1

D3c: US 6,288,289 B1

D6: EP 1 291 078 A2

IV. In the opposition proceedings, the respondent (patent holder) defended its patent in amended form. The opposition division considered the submitted requests (main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 3) to be admissible. It further concluded that the amendments made in the main request met the requirements of Article 123(2) and (3) EPC, that the claimed subject matter was clear within the meaning of Article 84 EPC, and that it was disclosed in a manner sufficiently enabling for the skilled person in accordance with Article 83 EPC. Furthermore, the claimed process was novel over the disclosure of document D3c (Article 54 EPC). It also involved an inventive step based on the technical teachings of documents D1 or D3c (Article 56 EPC).

V. The opponent filed an appeal against this decision in a timely manner.

VI. In its response to the appeal, the respondent (patent holder) presented arguments regarding the admissibility and patentability of its main request - the main request defended in the opposition proceedings - as well as concerning the admissibility and patentability of the auxiliary requests 1 to 5 submitted with the same letter. Auxiliary requests 1 to 3 had already been submitted during the opposition proceedings.

VII. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the Board communicated its preliminary opinion to the parties. At the same time, the parties were summoned to an oral hearing.

VIII. In response to the Board's communication, both parties submitted further written statements with additional arguments regarding the admissibility and patentability of the requests.

IX. An oral hearing took place on November 4, 2021, in the form of a video conference.

X. The present main request contains an independent claim with the following wording:

Process for the continuous production of nitrobenzene by adiabatic nitration of benzene with a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid, characterized in that the reaction mixture obtained during nitration is separated into an aqueous and an organic phase, from which water is subsequently evaporated from the aqueous phase, and the concentrated sulfuric acid obtained in the process is partially returned to the nitration, and additionally sulfuric acid with a concentration greater than 65 wt.% is introduced into the nitration, such that the sum of the concentrations of metal ions forming poorly soluble metal sulfates in the reaction zone is less than 900 mg/l, with calcium being below 100 mg/l and iron being below 300 mg/l, each based on the volume of the aqueous phase containing sulfuric acid.

XI. Claim 1 of the first auxiliary request relevant for the present decision has the following wording (additions compared to claim 1 of the main request are highlighted by the Board):

Process for the continuous production of nitrobenzene by adiabatic nitration of benzene with a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid, characterized in that the reaction mixture obtained during nitration is separated into an aqueous and an organic phase, from which water is subsequently evaporated from the aqueous phase, and the concentrated sulfuric acid obtained in the process is partially returned as circulating acid to the nitration, and additionally sulfuric acid with a comparable or greater concentration than that of the circulating acid, namely a concentration greater than 65 wt.%, is introduced into the nitration, such that the sum of the concentrations of metal ions forming poorly soluble metal sulfates in the reaction zone is less than 900 mg/l, with calcium being below 100 mg/l and iron being below 300 mg/l, each based on the volume of the aqueous phase containing sulfuric acid.

XII. Claim 1 of the second auxiliary request, also relevant for the present decision, has the following wording (additions compared to claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 are highlighted by the Board):

Process for the continuous production of nitrobenzene by adiabatic nitration of benzene with a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid, characterized in that the reaction mixture obtained during nitration is separated into an aqueous and an organic phase, from which water is subsequently evaporated from the aqueous phase, and the concentrated sulfuric acid obtained in the process is partially returned as circulating acid to the nitration, and additionally sulfuric acid with a comparable or greater concentration than that of the circulating acid, namely a concentration greater than 65 wt.% and a content of metal ions forming poorly soluble metal sulfates of 100 mg/l or less, is introduced into the nitration, such that the sum of the concentrations of metal ions forming poorly soluble metal sulfates in the reaction zone is less than 900 mg/l, with calcium being below 100 mg/l and iron being below 300 mg/l, each based on the volume of the aqueous phase containing sulfuric acid.

XIII. In her statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

The main request and auxiliary requests 1 and 2 should be ""excluded from the proceedings or not admitted and rejected."" The requests were submitted late in the first instance and were also formally inadmissible. Features had been included that were originally disclosed only in the description. Furthermore, not all objections raised by the opposition division in the ""summons decision"" had been addressed or resolved with the requests.

The submitted requests did not meet the requirement of Article 123(2) EPC. The amendments made compared to the originally filed application included features in the respective claims 1 without considering that these features had originally been disclosed only in combination with other features. The resulting new combinations of features found no support in the originally filed application.

The amendments made also led to clarity deficiencies, thus violating the requirements of Article 84 EPC.

The claimed subject matter was not sufficiently disclosed and therefore not executable by the skilled person within the meaning of Article 83 EPC.

Auxiliary requests 1 and 2 also did not meet the requirements of Rule 80 EPC, as not all amendments made were prompted by grounds for opposition.

Finally, the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request and of auxiliary request 1 was not novel, particularly in view of the disclosure of document D3c (Article 54 EPC), and the subject matter of all requests did not involve an inventive step, particularly based on the disclosure of documents D1 or D3c (Article 56 EPC).

XIV. In her response to the appeal and in the further proceedings, the respondent essentially argued as follows:

The admissibility of the submitted requests is not to be questioned, as they were already presented in the opposition proceedings, both in a timely manner and in response to a raised objection.

A basis for all amendments made can be found in the originally filed claims as well as in the description.

The clarity deficiencies raised should not be considered, as they relate to features already included in the granted patent claims.

Similarly, the objections regarding lack of enablement should be dismissed, as they concern at most clarity issues.

All amendments made in the auxiliary requests were necessary, particularly in response to the objections of lack of novelty and lack of inventive step, without leading to additional objections.

Novelty should be recognized for the subject matter of the submitted requests, as well as inventive step. In particular, the examples contained in the contested patent demonstrate technical effects that are not derivable for the skilled person from the considered prior art.

XV. Requests of the Parties

The appellant (opponent) requests that the patent be revoked, setting aside the contested decision.

The respondent (patent holder) requests that the appeal be dismissed (main request), or alternatively, that the patent be maintained in amended form based on one of auxiliary requests 1 to 5.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Admission and Consideration of the Main Request and Auxiliary Requests 1 and 2

The Board does not follow the request of the appellant for non-admission for the following reasons:

1.1 The present main request as well as auxiliary requests 1 and 2 were submitted during the opposition proceedings, namely in response to the preliminary opinion of the opposition division, which had been communicated to the parties in the annex to the summons for oral proceedings. The opposition division admitted the requests into the proceedings. It justified this by stating that the actions of the patent proprietor/respondent were a direct reaction to the points raised regarding lack of inventive step only mentioned in the summons for oral proceedings. Therefore, in the opinion of the opposition division, the requests could not have been submitted earlier. Although the amendments were taken from the description, this alone is not a reason to refuse admission of a request. Furthermore, the amendments are by no means particularly extensive, complex, or surprising.

1.2 In the annex to the summons for oral proceedings before the opposition division, it was explained that the presence of inventive step could not be recognized for the subject matter of claim 1. The reason given was that due to the missing information regarding the concentrations of calcium and iron in the claim, it was not shown that the technical problem was solved across the entire breadth of the claim (see page 7, second paragraph). Subsequently, the patent proprietor/respondent submitted requests that were intended to address the objection by including the mentioned features. Since these requests were also submitted within the time limit set by the opposition division under Rule 116(1) EPC, it is not apparent how the opposition division could have exercised its discretion to admit the requests incorrectly. Therefore, the Board sees no reason to grant the appellant's request for non-admission of the mentioned requests.

Main Request

2. Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

2.1 Claims 1, 3, and 4 of the originally filed application have the following wording:

1. A method for the continuous production of nitrobenzene by adiabatic nitration of benzene with a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid, characterized in that the sum of the concentrations of the insoluble metal sulfate-forming metal ions in the reaction zone is less than 900 mg/l, based on the volume of the aqueous phase containing sulfuric acid.

3. The method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the reaction mixture obtained during nitration is separated into an aqueous and an organic phase, from which water is subsequently evaporated from the aqueous phase, and the resulting concentrated sulfuric acid is at least partially returned to the nitration.

4. The method according to claim 3, characterized in that the concentrated sulfuric acid obtained from the evaporation of water is partially returned to the nitration, and additionally sulfuric acid with a concentration of greater than 65 wt.% is introduced into the nitration.

2.2 Claim 1 of the main request differs from the originally filed claim 1 initially by the following features:

""... that the reaction mixture obtained during nitration is separated into an aqueous and an organic phase, from which water is subsequently evaporated from the aqueous phase,

and the resulting concentrated sulfuric acid is partially returned to the nitration,

and additionally sulfuric acid with a concentration of greater than 65 wt.% is introduced into the nitration, ...""

In addition, the features were included that the concentration of the insoluble metal sulfate-forming metal ions in the reaction zone ""is below 100 mg/l for calcium and below 300 mg/l for iron.""

2.3 The amendments made thus particularly relate to the partial return of concentrated sulfuric acid and the introduction of additional sulfuric acid into the nitration. These two measures must be carried out according to the claim wording ""to an extent"" such that ""the sum of the concentrations of the insoluble metal sulfate-forming metal ions in the reaction zone is less than 900 mg/l and for calcium is below 100 mg/l and for iron is below 300 mg/l, each based on the volume of the aqueous phase containing sulfuric acid.""

2.4 As a basis for the added features, the respondent referred to dependent claims 3 and 4, as well as additionally to page 5, lines 3 to 15 of the description of the original application.

2.5 The mentioned passages do not provide sufficient support for the amendments for the following reasons:

2.5.1 From the original claims 3 and 4, it is evident, among other things, that the concentrated sulfuric acid ""obtained at least partially from the nitration is returned to the nitration"" (claim 3), and that ""additionally sulfuric acid with a concentration of greater than 65 wt.% is introduced into the nitration"" (claim 4) after the phase separation of the reaction mixture obtained during nitration and evaporation of water from the separated aqueous phase.

2.5.2 However, the mentioned claims do not disclose to what extent the return of concentrated sulfuric acid and the introduction of additional sulfuric acid into the nitration must be carried out. Furthermore, the limits for calcium (below 100 mg/l) and iron (below 300 mg/l) are not disclosed therein.

2.5.3 A disclosure of these features per se can be found in the passages of the description cited by the respondent (page 5, lines 3 to 15). In lines 9 to 12, it is described that the sulfuric acid ""is discharged and renewed to an extent"" such that the mentioned concentrations of metal ions preferably remain below the limits specified in the amended claim, particularly for calcium and iron.

2.5.4 However, this disclosure must be read in conjunction with the preceding paragraph (lines 3 to 8 of page 5). This is evident from the fact that the paragraph begins in line 9 with ""In this context, the sulfuric acid is discharged and renewed ..."". This establishes a connection between the extent of discharge and renewal (from line 9) and the sulfuric acids used for this purpose (lines 3 to 8).

However, the sulfuric acids described in the paragraph of lines 3 to 8 are fresh, metal ion-poor sulfuric acids.

In amended claim 1, however, the additionally introduced sulfuric acid is only limited by the feature contained in the original claim 4, namely that it has a concentration of greater than 65 wt.%. The condition that the sulfuric acid must also be metal ion-poor was not included in the amended claim 1. As explained above, this feature is only disclosed in combination with the feature that defines the extent of renewal of the sulfuric acid. However, the amended claim 1 also relates to a method in which the additionally introduced sulfuric acid does not have to be metal ion-poor. Since this method variant is not disclosed in the original application documents, the amendment made does not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

3. Since the main request is not allowable for this reason alone, there is no need to address the further objections of the appellant.

Auxiliary Request 1

4. Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

4.1 Claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 differs from claim 1 of the main request in that the returned sulfuric acid is ""returned as circulating acid"" to the nitration, and that for the additionally introduced acid, sulfuric acid ""with a comparable or greater concentration than that of the circulating acid, namely (...)"" is used.

4.2 However, the claim also does not contain a feature stating that the supplied sulfuric acid is ""metal ion-poor,"" as in claim 1 of the main request. Therefore, the assessment of the admissibility of the amendments made does not change, and the request does not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC for the same reasons as the main request.

4.3 Since auxiliary request 1 is also not allowable, there is no need to address the further objections of the appellant regarding this request.

Auxiliary Request 2

5. Requirements of Rule 80 EPC

5.1 The appellant particularly argued that the inclusion of the feature ""as circulating acid"" as well as the feature relating to the concentration of the introduced sulfuric acid, concluded by ""namely,"" was not prompted by a ground for opposition. They merely led to a clarification of the features already present in the claim. However, objections under Article 84 EPC do not constitute a ground for opposition, and therefore these amendments were not prompted by a ground for opposition and are thus inadmissible under Rule 80 EPC.

5.2 The respondent pointed out that the objection was raised late and was therefore inadmissible. Furthermore, these amendments were made to avoid clarity objections related to features that had been included in the claim due to previously raised objections.

5.3 This objection is not convincing, regardless of its admissibility:

In claim 1 of the amended main request, the claimed method was initially restricted compared to the granted version in that ""additionally sulfuric acid with a concentration of greater than 65 wt.% is introduced into the nitration."" The two features mentioned under point 5.1 of this decision were added to claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 in addition to this condition.

By the feature concluded with ""namely,"" a connection is established between the concentration of the introduced sulfuric acid and the circulating acid. The introduced sulfuric acid must now not only have a concentration of greater than 65 wt.%, but it must also have a comparable or greater concentration than that of the circulating acid. The inclusion of this feature thus represents an additional restriction regarding the introduced sulfuric acid.

According to the explanations of the respondent, the inclusion of the feature ""as circulating acid"" was intended to preempt a potential objection of lack of clarity. This defines the expression ""the circulating acid"" introduced into the claim in advance. This is convincing.

Overall, the actions of the respondent can be seen as at least an attempt to counter the objections of the appellant regarding lack of novelty and lack of inventive step by including further, limiting features, and to do so in such a way that no additional deficiencies arise. Thus, the inclusion of the features was prompted by a ground for opposition raised by the appellant.

5.4 Therefore, the requirements of Rule 80 EPC are fulfilled.

6. Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

6.1 Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 differs from claim 1 of the originally filed version initially by all additional features of auxiliary request 1 (see under points 2.2 and 4.1 of this decision). Furthermore, the claim includes the stipulation that the additionally introduced sulfuric acid has a ""content of insoluble metal salt-forming metal ions of 100 mg/l or less.""

6.2 The requirements of Article 123(2) EPC for this request can be considered fulfilled for the following reasons:

6.2.1 In contrast to claim 1 of the preceding requests, claim 1 of this request contains a feature that addresses the objection of impermissible amendment discussed under point 2.5.4 of this decision. Specifically, the feature has been added that the additionally introduced sulfuric acid is metal ion-poor in that it has a ""content of insoluble metal salt-forming metal ions of 100 mg/l or less.""

This feature is disclosed in the originally filed description on page 8, lines 22 to 30, as well as in original claim 6.

A basis for the remaining amendments concerning this request can be found in the original description, namely in line 3 of page 8 (partial return of the concentrated sulfuric acid ""as circulating acid""), in lines 22 to 30 of page 8 (introduction of additional sulfuric acid ""with a comparable or greater concentration than that of the circulating acid, namely""), as well as in lines 9 to 15 of page 5 (""and for calcium is below 100 mg/l and for iron is below 300 mg/l"").

6.2.2 The appellant argued that the combination of selected features resulted in a new technical teaching for which there is no basis in the original application documents.

6.2.3 This view cannot be upheld.

First, it is evident from lines 22 to 30 of page 8 that the freshly supplied sulfuric acid should have both a comparable or higher concentration of H2SO4 and significantly fewer metal ions than the circulating acid. Preferred values are given for this, namely greater than 65 wt.% and 100 mg/l or less. These are the features included in the claim. Their combination is therefore disclosed. The mentioned passage on page 8 refers to the sulfuric acid disclosed in lines 7 to 8 of page 5 of the original description (see under point 2.5.4 of this decision). This combines the features relating to the content of metal ions in the supplied sulfuric acid (100 mg/l or less) and the concentration of this sulfuric acid (comparable or greater concentration than that of the circulating acid) with those of the concentrations for calcium and iron (below 100 mg/l and below 300 mg/l) on page 5 in combination and in relation to the claimed method. That the concentrated sulfuric acid is returned ""as circulating acid"" to the nitration is unambiguously evident to the skilled person in combination with the further features of the claimed method.

7. Clarity (Article 84 EPC)

7.1 The appellant particularly raised the following points, which they believe lead to a violation of the requirements of Article 84 EPC:

i) the feature of the unit mg/l used for the concentration is temperature and pressure dependent,

ii) the concentration values regarding calcium and iron are each based on the volume of the aqueous phase containing sulfuric acid, but there is no aqueous phase present in the reaction zone,

iii) by specifying the concentration values for calcium and iron, it remains open which other metal ions form the difference of 500 mg/l resulting from the amendment,

iv) the solubility of salts in sulfuric acid depends on its water content; without specifying the water content of the sulfuric acid, the phase ratio between nitric acid and organic phase, and the temperature in the nitration mixture, it is not possible for the skilled person to distinguish whether the effect of preventing the precipitation of insoluble metal sulfates can be achieved across the entire claimed breadth,

v) the solubility limits of insoluble sulfates other than calcium and iron are not specified, thus essential features of the invention are missing in the claim,

vi) without specifying determination methods, the concentration specification of the sulfuric acid introduced into the nitration is neither comprehensible nor reproducible for the skilled person; it is also unclear what is meant by a ""comparable"" concentration to that of the circulating acid,

vii) the term ""circulating acid"" is unclear to the skilled person.

7.2 These objections cannot convince.

7.2.1 Initially, while the objections raised relate to features that were added to claim 1 during the opposition proceedings (concentrations in mg/l of the metal ions calcium and iron, as well as the metal ions of the supplied sulfuric acid), the concentration specification for the metal ions was already indicated in the granted claims in the same unit. Therefore, the treatment of the objections raised under points i) and ii) above, as already noted by the opposition division, is not possible in light of the decision G 3/14 when examining the requirements of Article 84 EPC.

7.2.2 Regarding the features mentioned under points iii) to vii), no clarity deficiency can be recognized for the following reasons:

For a definition of the claimed method, the nature of the additionally present ions is as irrelevant as the specification of the solubility limits of calcium and iron in the claim.

The question of whether the mentioned effect occurs or not is not connected to the clarity of the subject matter defined in the claim. In particular, the effect is not mentioned in the claim.

The skilled person can determine for a given sulfuric acid whether it is present in a concentration of greater than 65 wt.%. Furthermore, the concentration of the additionally introduced sulfuric acid must necessarily be ""greater than 65 wt.%"" according to the claim. Thus, there is also no clarity deficiency in connection with the requirement for a ""comparable"" concentration.

Finally, the skilled person is already clear about what is meant by the term ""circulating acid"" used in the claim. Moreover, the term is explained both in the patent itself (paragraph [0031]) and in the passages of the prior art cited by the respondent (for example, D1: page 5, line 12).

7.2.3 Therefore, the request meets the requirements of Article 84 EPC.

8. Sufficiency of Disclosure (Article 83 EPC)

8.1 The opposition division dismissed the objection of lack of sufficiency of disclosure regarding the main request in its decision.

In the appeal proceedings, the appellant maintained their objection also regarding auxiliary request 2. They based their argumentation essentially on the following points:

i) Claim 1 does not contain all essential measures required to achieve the desired result of the maximum concentration for the sum of the insoluble metal sulfate-forming metal ions of 900 mg/l; thus, the feature is merely a statement of a result to be achieved,

ii) the features of the maximum concentration of 900 mg/l as well as the concentrations of calcium and iron are not reproducible, as they relate to a reaction zone, but such a reaction zone is not part of the claimed method,

iii) there is no aqueous phase containing sulfuric acid in the reaction zone, thus the skilled person cannot see how they should relate concentration specifications to the volume of this non-existent aqueous phase containing sulfuric acid,

iv) the features relating to the maximum concentration as well as the concentrations of the sulfates of calcium and iron are merely the specification of parameters that are not customary in the art, and the patent lacks a specification of a measurement or determination method for their clear, unambiguous, and reproducible determination, particularly considering the temperature and pressure dependence of these parameters and the lack of specification regarding the exact location and reaction time of their determination; the use of parameters is only permissible for defining the subject matter of the claim if no other definition is possible,

v) the term ""insoluble metal sulfates"" is relative, thus the skilled person cannot recognize which specific metal sulfates are included,

vi) the skilled person cannot distinguish the teaching of the patent from the prior art,

vii) the continuous separation of small amounts of sulfuric acid from a sulfuric acid circuit of an adiabatic nitration of benzene is technically complex to nearly impossible in a pipe reactor.

8.2 The Board agrees with the assessment of the opposition division for the following reasons:

8.2.1 Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 is directed to a method for the continuous production of nitrobenzene by adiabatic nitration of benzene with a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid. To carry out the claimed method, the skilled person must be able to perform a method in which nitrobenzene can be produced through the process steps specified in the claim, using the information provided in the patent and their general technical knowledge. The knowledge necessary for the skilled person must also be sufficient to reproduce the method across the entire breadth of the claim without undue burden. To establish a lack of sufficiency of disclosure, serious doubts must exist that are substantiated by verifiable facts.

8.2.2 The claimed method particularly requires a process in which the return of concentrated sulfuric acid and the introduction of fresh sulfuric acid of certain quality into the nitration must be carried out ""such that the sum of the concentrations of the insoluble metal sulfate-forming metal ions in the reaction zone is less than 900 mg/l and for calcium is below 100 mg/l and for iron is below 300 mg/l, each based on the volume of the aqueous phase containing sulfuric acid."" Whether further effects are achieved is not relevant to the question of sufficiency of disclosure, as such potential effects are not part of the definition of the claimed method. However, it must be ensured that the specified concentrations are not exceeded.

8.2.3 The appellant particularly doubted that the skilled person would be able to measure the concentrations of the insoluble metal sulfate-forming metal ions in the reaction zone. They assumed that conducting such a measurement is necessary for carrying out the claimed method.

8.2.4 The Board first notes that at least one example is disclosed in the description of the patent that shows that a method for producing nitrobenzene was carried out, in which a concentration of insoluble metal sulfate-forming metal ions is specified, namely in the aqueous phase containing sulfuric acid in the reaction zone (see example 3, particularly the last sentence in paragraph [0048]). The specified concentration is 400 mg/l, which is below the maximum value of 900 mg/l claimed. It was apparently measured after continuous operation over a period of 6 weeks. It is not explicitly stated in this example whether the claimed limits for the concentrations of calcium and iron are also adhered to. However, the appellant has not provided any factual submissions as to why this should not be the case. Thus, it can be assumed that the patent itself provides at least one way to carry out the claimed method.

8.2.5 According to the information in the description of the patent (see particularly paragraphs [0041], [0043], and [0046]), the measurement of the metal ion concentrations is carried out using atomic absorption spectrometry. According to the further explanations of the respondent in their response to the appeal, the skilled person would have no problems taking a sample from the reaction zone explained in the description (see paragraphs [0004] and [0024]) and examining the ion concentrations using a commonly used atomic absorption spectrometer after cooling to room temperature and the resulting phase separation.

This argumentation is convincing. Even if the actual measurement takes place outside the reaction zone, the obtained values should relate to the conditions within the reaction zone. The specification of a concentration in the unit mg/l is also familiar to the skilled person. Furthermore, in the description, in addition to calcium and iron, other metal ions are mentioned that form insoluble metal sulfates with sulfate in sulfuric acid (see paragraph [0009]).

8.2.6 The respondent also explained that achieving or exceeding the claimed maximum values can be avoided by appropriately adjusting the amount of already used sulfuric acid and the amount of fresh sulfuric acid supplied (see under point b) on page 10 of the response to the appeal). This is also evident from the description of the patent (see particularly paragraphs [0017] and [0018] as well as example 3, paragraph [0048]).

8.2.7 The skilled person also learns from the description of the patent what additional measures can be taken to ensure that the claimed maximum value is not exceeded (see particularly paragraphs [0029], [0031], and [0034]).

8.2.8 The appellant's argument that the skilled person cannot recognize a difference from the prior art is not convincing, as this is irrelevant to the question of sufficiency of disclosure of the currently claimed method.

8.2.9 The appellant has not presented any evidence for the mere assertion that carrying out the claimed method would be technically complex or nearly impossible. While certain requirements may be placed on its realization, it is already shown in the description of the patent that this is indeed possible (see under point 8.2.4 of this decision).

8.3 The arguments presented by the appellant are therefore not suitable to demonstrate a lack of sufficiency of disclosure in the sense of Article 83 EPC.

9. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

Closest Prior Art

9.1 The parties argued inventive step based on documents D1 and D3c. Both of these documents are suitable as starting points for assessing inventive step. Both documents deal, like the patent in suit, with nitration processes for producing nitrobenzene from benzene using a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acid.

Distinguishing Features

9.2 Neither D1 nor D3c provide values for the concentrations of insoluble metal sulfate-forming metal ions, particularly calcium and iron, in the reaction zone. Furthermore, the mentioned documents do not disclose a content of insoluble metal sulfate-forming metal ions in the introduced sulfuric acid. This was undisputed between the parties.

9.3 The appellant argued, referring to calculations regarding the process disclosed in D3c, that the values of the metal ions specified in the claim would automatically adjust in D3c, as the volume flows are the same as in the claimed process. Thus, there is no distinguishing feature in the metal ion concentrations.

9.4 This argument is not convincing. Even assuming that the volume flows are identical, it does not necessarily follow that the claimed concentrations are achieved. In particular, neither the quality of the acids used nor the formation of metal sulfates, which according to document D1 enter the sulfuric acid due to corrosion (D1: page 6, lines 12 to 13), are taken into account.

9.5 The appellant further argued that the skilled person would undoubtedly only use acids of the best quality. Therefore, these would not be contaminated with metal ions.

9.6 This assertion is also not convincing. While the skilled person will use starting materials of sufficient quality for each process whenever possible, they are not necessarily compelled to use the best possible quality, as they must also consider the economic aspects of the process being carried out.

9.7 Therefore, even with comparable amounts of supplied or removed sulfuric acid, it cannot be assumed that the claimed concentrations are necessarily adhered to in the processes described in D1 or D3c. Thus, it cannot be assumed that the mentioned features are at least implicitly realized in the mentioned processes.

9.8 Thus, the claimed method differs from the known methods from both D1 and D3c primarily by the concentrations of insoluble metal sulfate-forming metal ions, particularly calcium and iron, in the reaction zone, as well as by the content of insoluble metal sulfate-forming metal ions in the introduced sulfuric acid. Furthermore, the return of concentrated sulfuric acid and the introduction of additional sulfuric acid into the nitration occurs to an extent that the mentioned ion concentrations in the reaction zone are below the values specified in the claim.

Technical Problem and Proposed Solution

9.9 The parties held differing views on the technical effect caused by the distinguishing features. According to the appellant, the solved technical problem could only be seen as providing an alternative, as the examples contained in the patent do not allow for a comparison with the closest prior art.

9.10 The Board does not follow this view. The patent in suit provides examples indicating that only by adhering to the claimed concentrations of calcium (below 100 mg/l) and iron (below 300 mg/l), as well as by partially returning the concentrated sulfuric acid and additionally introducing fresh sulfuric acid, which also meets the claimed feature of a content of insoluble metal sulfate-forming metal ions of 100 mg/l or less, can deposits on the heat exchanger of the nitration plant be avoided over a period of 12 weeks (examples 2 and 3).

For example 3, the concentrations of calcium and iron in the circulating acid are 90 and 100 mg/l, respectively, with a total content of metal ions in the reaction zone of 200 mg/l, and the content of metal ions in the supplied sulfuric acid is 50 mg/l. Furthermore, the total ion content is specified as 400 mg/l, which is established within the first 6 weeks, starting from 200 mg/l.

In contrast, according to example 2, the use of circulating acid with metal ion concentrations outside the claimed range (660 mg/l iron, total ion content in the reaction zone 905 mg/l) leads to deposits on the plate heat exchanger that require its removal and cleaning, even with a content of insoluble metal sulfate-forming metal ions in the reaction zone below the claimed maximum value (675 mg/l). Unlike example 3, no fresh sulfuric acid, particularly not with the claimed qualities, was introduced according to example 2.

9.11 The appellant can be agreed with in that the examples in the patent do not allow for a direct comparison with the processes according to D1 or D3c. Nevertheless, they allow the conclusion that a reduction of deposits on the heat exchanger can be achieved over a longer period if the claimed concentrations of metal ions are adhered to.

9.12 The argument of the respondent is understandable in that attempts to make a direct comparison with the processes described in D1 or D3c would be poorly feasible, as these documents do not disclose concentrations for the relevant metal ions.

9.13 Thus, the solved technical problem can be seen as providing an improved nitration process, wherein the improvement consists in that fewer deposits caused by insoluble metal sulfates occur in the nitration plant, as indicated in paragraph [0016] of the patent in suit.

9.14 To solve this problem, it is proposed in the claim to partially replace the sulfuric acid contained in the circulating acid with fresh sulfuric acid that has a defined concentration and a maximum content of insoluble metal sulfate-forming metal ions, such that the claimed concentrations of metal ions in the reaction zone are not exceeded.

Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

9.15 The prior art cited by the opponent, documents D6, D7a, and D10, does not provide the skilled person with any hints towards the claimed solution to the posed technical problem. It should be considered not only whether the distinguishing features as such are known from the prior art, but whether the skilled person would have modified the processes disclosed in documents D1 or D3c in such a way that the posed technical problem is solved, i.e., that deposits caused by insoluble metal sulfates in the nitration plant are avoided.

In documents D6 and D7, reference is made to the partial replacement of discharged sulfuric acid. However, according to the teaching of these documents, this serves either to avoid the accumulation of by-products (D6: paragraph [0022]) or to keep the level of impurities low (D7: page 3, lines 43 to 44). However, the skilled person would not understand by-products and impurities in nitration reactions to mean metal sulfates, but rather organic products (see D7, page 3, lines 45 and 57 to 58). Furthermore, none of these documents refers to the deposition of metal sulfates in the nitration plant.

Document D10 discusses the solubility behavior of metal salts, but it relates to the issue of processing waste sulfuric acids (page 1, column 1, first paragraph) and therefore does not provide any hints towards the solution of the posed problem according to the patent in suit.

9.16 Thus, the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 involves an inventive step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC.

10. In summary, it can be stated that none of the reasons presented by the appellant against the admission and grant of auxiliary request 2 can prevail.

I. Against the decision of the Opposition Division regarding the revocation of European Patent 2 190 425, which was posted on November 27, 2017, the representative of the patent owner (appellant) submitted a notice of appeal dated January 24, 2018, on January 25, 2018. In this notice, the appellant requested the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent in its granted form, and alternatively requested an oral hearing. The appeal fee was duly paid on the same day.

II. In a communication pursuant to Article 108 sentence 1 and Rule 101 (2) sentence 1 EPC dated February 7, 2018 (EPO Form 3045), the appellant was informed that a deficiency had been identified in the notice of appeal, as it did not contain the name and address of the appellant contrary to the provision of Rule 99 (1) a) EPC. The appellant was given a period of two months to rectify the deficiency. According to the return receipt, the appellant received the communication on February 12, 2018.

III. On March 23, 2018, the statement of grounds of appeal and a copy of the notice of appeal were submitted. These documents also did not contain the missing information.

IV. In a communication dated October 15, 2018, the Board informed the parties that the appeal was likely to be rejected as inadmissible and requested clarification from the appellant as to whether they wished to maintain the request for an oral hearing.

V. In a submission dated December 4, 2018, the representative of the appellant provided the name of the appellant as well as their address and confirmed that the request for an oral hearing would be maintained.

VI. The Board then summoned the parties to an oral hearing for December 4, 2019, indicating that the question of the admissibility of the appeal would be the sole subject of the hearing.

VII. On November 26, 2019, the appellant withdrew their request for an oral hearing. The date for the oral hearing was subsequently canceled.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal was filed in a timely manner on January 25, 2018, in accordance with Article 108 sentences 1 and 2 in conjunction with Rules 126 and 131 EPC.

2. However, the notice of appeal lacked the information required by Rule 99 (1) a) EPC regarding the name and address of the appellant as stipulated in Rule 41 (2) c) EPC.

3. Within the two-month period for remedying the deficiencies, which was set by the chamber's request under Rule 101 (2) sentence 1 EPC and which expired on April 17, 2018 (Rules 126 (2), 131 (1), (4) EPC), submissions were made by the appellant, but these did not contain the missing information.

4. Only on December 4, 2018, and thus after the expiration of the period set under Rule 101 (2) sentence 1 EPC, were the missing details communicated. However, this does not change the fact that the deficiency was not remedied in a timely manner within the meaning of Rule 101 (2) EPC.

5. Therefore, the appeal must be rejected as inadmissible in accordance with Rule 101 (2) sentence 2 EPC.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed as inadmissible.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,Oystershell N.V.,Oystershell N.V.

III. In its decision, the opposition division concluded that the claims of the granted patent and the first auxiliary request before it were not novel in view of D1. The claims of the second auxiliary request were novel and also inventive based on D4 as the closest prior art.

IV. In her statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant argued that the compositions claimed in the maintained form of the patent were suggested to the skilled person starting from D4. Furthermore, they were also suggested starting from D2, which was a more suitable closest prior art than D4. In any case, the claims did not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC. The patent should therefore be revoked.

V. In her response to the appeal, the respondent essentially argued that the arguments of the opposition division were correct. D4 was the closest prior art. The claimed compositions were not suggested to the skilled person starting from D4.

VI. In a communication pursuant to Rule 100(2) EPC dated August 27, 2020, the board communicated its preliminary opinion on the facts and legal situation to the parties. It stated that, in its view, D1 was the document representing the closest prior art. Starting from D1, the claimed compositions were not suggested to the skilled person.

VII. The parties did not submit any further substantive submissions. In a letter dated December 15, 2020, the appellant withdrew her request for oral proceedings made in the statement of grounds of appeal and requested to remain in the written procedure.

VIII. The appellant requests that the contested decision be overturned and the patent be revoked.

The respondent (patent proprietor) requests that the appeal be dismissed. Alternatively, she requests oral proceedings.

IX. Claim 1 of the request underlying this decision reads:

Cosmetic or dermatological preparation comprising hydrolyzed milk protein, one or more citrus oils, and additionally one or more fragrance oils that include the citrus oils, characterized in that the proportion of citrus oils is in the range of 0.01 to 0.1 wt.%, based on the total mass of the preparation, the citrus oils are present in an amount of up to 30 wt.%, based on the total mass of fragrance oil, and the citrus oils are chosen to be orange oil and bergamot oil.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. The auxiliary request for oral proceedings was made only by the respondent. Since, as will be explained further, the higher-ranking request for rejection of the appeal is granted, a decision in written proceedings is permissible.

3. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

3.1 The patent claims cosmetic or dermatological preparations containing hydrolyzed milk protein and additionally citrus oils. The independent claim underlying the decision restricts the citrus oils to orange oil and/or bergamot oil in a specific proportion.

The only disputed point is whether these compositions were suggested to a skilled person by the prior art.

3.2 The appellant essentially argues as follows:

In the contested decision, D4 represents the closest prior art. In D4, milk proteins are stabilized by ascorbic acid. In the present case, stabilization is achieved through citrus oils.

The patent contains no data regarding the stabilizing effect of the citrus oils on the milk proteins. The effect was considered credible in the decision, as the antioxidant effect of citrus oils is generally known from the prior art. This is contradictory because if this effect was known, the claims could not be based on inventive step.

An effect of selecting the claimed citrus oils in the claimed concentration ranges has not been demonstrated, although this is necessary for selection inventions. Reference was made to the Guidelines for Examination.

A skilled person would therefore have used citrus oils as alternative antioxidants to stabilize milk proteins starting from D4.

Furthermore, D2 is a more suitable starting point for assessing inventive step.

3.3 The respondent essentially argues that the arguments of the opposition division are correct. D4 is the closest prior art. Starting from D4, the stabilization of milk proteins by bergamot and orange oil in the claimed concentration is not obvious.

3.4 The Board does not find the arguments of the appellant convincing for the following reasons:

3.4.1 The patent claims cosmetic or dermatological preparations containing hydrolyzed milk protein and additionally citrus oils. The independent claim underlying the decision restricts the citrus oils to orange oil and/or bergamot oil in a specific proportion.

3.4.2 The patent addresses the problem of providing cosmetic preparations with milk proteins that do not have stability issues and remain unaffected in their olfactory design, see paragraph [0007] of the patent. The instability of hydrolyzed milk proteins leads to odor impairments (see paragraph [0006] of the patent).

3.4.3 The parties cited D2 and D4 as the closest prior art; the opposition division based its decision on D4. It justified this by stating that D4 deals with the oxidation of milk and the associated bad odor and suggests preventing this by adding antioxidants.

3.4.4 However, the Board is of the opinion that only D1 among the cited documents qualifies as the closest prior art, for the following reasons:

D1 is a document that lies in the field of the claimed invention, as it describes cosmetic preparations containing hydrolyzed milk proteins. This moisturizes the skin. Additionally, it contains essential oils, for example, citrus oils, which serve aromatherapy (see, for example, page 3, lines 15-20).

A skilled person aiming to produce certain cosmetic preparations containing hydrolyzed milk proteins would initially refer to a document that contains such preparations. Otherwise, they would not even become aware of the problem addressed in the patent.

D2 does not deal with cosmetic preparations, milk, or citrus oils and is therefore not suitable as the closest prior art.

D4 is a review article on the influence of singlet oxygen on the stability of food. This document also refers to the stability of milk under light and oxygen influence (page 66) and explains how the sour taste of milk arises. At the end of the section on milk, it concludes that the addition of ascorbic acid as a singlet oxygen quencher can prevent the souring of milk. Such a document may play a role as a secondary document in the discussion of inventive step. However, a skilled person would not start from D4 if they wanted to produce stabilized cosmetic compositions. Cosmetic or dermatological compositions are not mentioned in D4.

3.4.5 Starting from D1, the skilled person faced the problem mentioned in paragraph [0007] of the patent, which is to produce cosmetic compositions that do not have stability issues. In particular, the degradation of the milk protein should be prevented.

The claimed solution to the problem consists of using compositions in which bergamot oil or orange oil is contained in a specific proportion.

3.4.6 The appellant does not dispute that the addition of the oils as claimed can achieve such stabilization. The Board also does not harbor such doubts. Although the patent contains no data, the problem posed is therefore considered solved.

3.4.7 However, the appellant believes that the claimed solution is obvious to a skilled person and refers to D1, D2, D4, and D6-D9.

3.4.8 The Board comes to a different conclusion.

D1 itself does not deal with the stabilization of milk protein. Stability considerations in D1 relate to the stability of emulsions, see, for example, page 8, line 6ff. Therefore, D1 does not provide the skilled person with any indication to add bergamot or orange oil in the claimed concentrations to avoid stability and odor problems. Although these two ingredients are mentioned (page 6), they are included in a long list of possible essential oils that is by no means limited to citrus oils.

None of the cited documents discloses that citrus oils are suitable for stabilizing milk proteins. In the cited documents, it is not even disclosed that hydrolyzed milk proteins can or must be stabilized by antioxidants in cosmetic preparations.

D4 discloses that the ""light taste"" of milk arises from singlet oxygen oxidation of methionine, which can be prevented by ascorbic acid (see the last paragraph on page 66). To what extent this finding is applicable to cosmetic preparations containing hydrolyzed milk proteins is not mentioned, nor are any properties of orange and bergamot oil as singlet oxygen quenchers.

D6-D9 generally describe the antioxidant properties of various citrus oils. A property as a singlet oxygen quencher is not described. In cases where the antioxidant mechanism is mentioned (D8, page 77, second column, D9 page 3391, first column), it concerns properties as radical scavengers, not singlet oxygen. A skilled person had no reason to use this knowledge to stabilize hydrolyzed milk proteins in cosmetic preparations, let alone by means of the two specifically claimed oils in the claimed concentration ranges.

D2 is equally unhelpful to the skilled person, as it does not describe either milk proteins or citrus oils.

3.4.9 The appellant's statements regarding selection inventions miss the core of the matter. This is not a selection invention in which a fundamentally known effect would need to be demonstrated in a special way through comparative tests. Neither in the closest prior art (D1) nor in any other document is a stabilizing effect of orange or bergamot oil on hydrolyzed milk proteins described.

It is also not a contradiction, as claimed by the appellant, to accept the alleged stabilizing effect as given and at the same time consider the use of the claimed citrus oils as inventive. Even if an antioxidant effect of citrus oils was known in other contexts, the inventive step lies in utilizing it to prevent odor changes in cosmetic preparations containing hydrolyzed milk proteins. This is not suggested by the prior art.

3.5 Starting from D1 as the closest prior art, the above-defined technical problem was therefore solved in a manner not obvious to the skilled person. Inventive step is present.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,appeal dismissed,Henkel AG & Co.

I. The appeal is directed against the decision of the examining division to refuse European patent application 08759205.1 under Article 97(2) EPC.

II. The patent application in question relates to mixtures of linear, odd-numbered hydrocarbons used as base materials for cosmetic formulations.

III. The decision of the examining division is based on document D6:

D6: WO2007/068371

The examining division found that the valid priority date for the present application is April 3, 2008, so that D6 is relevant under Article 56 EPC.

The examining division concluded in its decision that the skilled person would have found the hydrocarbon mixtures claimed in the examination procedure in search of alternatives to the components of cosmetic formulations described in D6 without inventive effort. Mixtures of defined odd-numbered hydrocarbons are suggested in D6 as components of cosmetics. The selection of the claimed mixtures from the general teaching of D6 does not require inventive action.

IV. In her statement of appeal, the appellant argued that the objection of lack of inventive step is unfounded. A skilled person would not have derived from D6 the teaching that any mixtures of odd-numbered hydrocarbons are suitable for the cosmetics industry. The selection of specific mixtures made in the claims would therefore not have been suggested to the skilled person. Furthermore, she submitted comparative tests which, in her opinion, demonstrate an improved sensory quality of the claimed mixtures compared to D6.

V. On October 1, 2019, the board issued a communication under Article 15(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal 2007, in which it presented its preliminary view of the factual and legal situation. The board was particularly of the opinion that the claimed mixtures would have been suggested to the skilled person by D6 and that the submitted comparative tests did not demonstrate an improvement of the claimed mixtures over D6.

VI. In a letter dated March 12, 2021, the appellant submitted two sets of amended claims as main and auxiliary requests. She argued that the comparative tests submitted with the statement of appeal demonstrated an improvement in sensory properties of the now claimed mixtures.

VII. An oral hearing took place on March 23, 2021, which was conducted as a video conference with the consent of the appellant due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.

VIII. The appellant requested the annulment of the contested decision and the grant of a patent based on the main request, or alternatively based on the auxiliary request, both submitted with the letter dated March 12, 2021.

The arguments presented in detail by the appellant during the proceedings are reproduced below in the reasons for the decision.

IX. The independent claim of the main request reads:

Hydrocarbon mixture comprising a hydrocarbon mixture with at least two different hydrocarbons, wherein the two different hydrocarbons are selected from linear C15 and linear C17 hydrocarbons, and wherein these two different hydrocarbons comprise at least 70 wt.-% based on the total of the hydrocarbons.

The independent claim of the auxiliary request reads:

Hydrocarbon mixture comprising a hydrocarbon mixture with at least two different hydrocarbons, wherein the two different hydrocarbons are selected from linear C15 and linear C17 hydrocarbons, and wherein these two different hydrocarbons comprise at least 99 wt.-% based on the total of the hydrocarbons.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

Main Request

2.1 Closest Prior Art

2.1.1 D6 is undisputedly the closest prior art. Although D6 was published after the first claimed priority date, the claimed subject matter is undisputedly only disclosed in the priority applications filed on April 3, 2008. D6 was published earlier, namely on June 21, 2007, and is therefore prior art under Article 54(2) EPC and can thus be used for the assessment of inventive step.

2.1.2 D6 addresses the issue of how to avoid the disadvantages of petroleum-based cosmetic bases (in particular ""light emollients""), which usually consist of mixtures of various linear and branched hydrocarbons.

D6 proposes to produce and use linear hydrocarbons of defined length; a new manufacturing process for these compounds is described. In this way, various properties can be specifically influenced, such as spreading behavior, see the first four paragraphs on page 1, the second complete paragraph on page 2, or the first complete paragraph on page 5.

Furthermore, it is described that particularly odd-numbered hydrocarbons are suitable for this purpose; this is evident from the third and fourth paragraphs on page 4. There, odd-numbered C7-C23 alkanes and their mixtures are generally mentioned, with specific examples being C9, C11, C13, and C17. In the examples, either C11 or C13 is used. In claim 6 (in conjunction with claims 8 and 10), a carbon range of C11-C15 is indicated as particularly preferred.

2.1.3 The claims of the present main request differ from the disclosure of D6 in that mixtures are claimed that specifically contain a mixture of linear C15 and C17 hydrocarbons; the sum of these two should constitute at least 70% of the contained hydrocarbons.

2.2 Problem and Solution

2.2.1 According to the appellant, the technical problem was solved by the mixtures defined in claim 1, starting from D6, to find hydrocarbon mixtures as a base, particularly for decorative cosmetics, that exhibit improved properties in terms of sensory perception compared to the closest prior art. Improved sensory perception involves the interaction of various factors. To demonstrate the improved sensory properties, reference was made to the two comparative tests.

2.2.2 According to the Board, the submitted comparative tests do not demonstrate such a multifactorial improvement in sensory perception compared to the prior art.

The first of the two submitted tests compares a 1:1 mixture of C15/C17 hydrocarbons with a reference that contains 50% of such a mixture, alongside 50% of a 35:15 mixture of C11/C13 hydrocarbons. The second test compares a 1:1 mixture of C15/C17 hydrocarbons with 100% C11.

In the first test, a number of properties change. In the second test, only the spreadability decreases, while all other measured properties remain the same. The first test shows significantly more differences in the tested mixture compared to the reference than the second, even though the reference substance in the first case already consists of 50% of the mixture defined in the claim. In the second case, however, the reference substance is structurally much further away. This fact alone already shows that the comparative tests are not suitable to demonstrate an effect on the complex sensory perception due to the structural differences, i.e., the selection of C15/C17 hydrocarbons, as claimed by the appellant.

From the submitted tests, it can at most be derived that a mixture of C15/C17 hydrocarbons shows a lower tendency to spread than shorter-chain hydrocarbons such as the tested C11.

2.2.3 The technical problem solved by the claimed mixtures containing C15/C17 hydrocarbons was therefore to find mixtures with less pronounced spreading behavior based on the compositions specifically disclosed in D6.

2.3 Obviousness of the Solution

2.3.1 This technical problem was solved in an obvious manner.

D6 explicitly describes the possibility of producing linear hydrocarbons of defined chain length and mixing them in a targeted manner according to the modular principle to achieve specific properties, such as spreading behavior (page 5, first complete paragraph). D6 also provides the skilled person with indications as to which types of linear hydrocarbons should be used, namely those with 7 to 23, 9-17, or 11-15 carbon atoms (claim 6 or third and fourth paragraphs on page 4). The skilled person therefore knows which types of hydrocarbons they can mix and also knows that spreading behavior is influenced by the selection and mixing of hydrocarbons. A mixture that exhibits a desired spreading behavior can therefore be found through routine experimentation. The skilled person does not need to engage in inventive activity to solve the posed problem.

2.3.2 The arguments of the appellant are not convincing.

It was argued that D6 contains no indications on how to proceed when selecting certain hydrocarbons to achieve specific results. In particular, the examples in D6 use pure substances rather than mixtures. Mixtures are only mentioned as a possibility, and there is a large number of potentially possible mixtures.

However, D6 reveals the possibility of influencing spreading behavior through selection and mixing. The approximate length of the preferred odd-numbered linear hydrocarbons is also described, as stated above. Therefore, D6 provides a possible starting point, pathways for modification, and the parameters to be observed. Should the skilled person wish to modify the spreading behavior starting from the pure C11 or C13 alkanes disclosed in the examples, they would arrive at the claimed result through experimentation within the linear hydrocarbons described as preferred. Furthermore, the appellant has stated in the appeal that a skilled person would not use hydrocarbons with chain lengths below eleven and above nineteen for various reasons in cosmetic applications; thus, the available selection of hydrocarbons is further restricted. A large number of trials is therefore not required, especially since the present claims do not define a specific mixing ratio that would need to be adjusted additionally.

2.4 The main request is therefore not allowable due to lack of inventive step.

Auxiliary Request

2.5 The claims of the auxiliary request differ from those of the main request by the feature that the claimed mixture contains 99 wt.-% based on the sum of the hydrocarbons of the defined C15/C17 mixture, instead of just at least 70%.

This feature does not play a role in the above assessment of the main request. The analysis was made on the assumption that a skilled person would use and mix the hydrocarbons proposed in D6 to solve the posed problem. In the simplest case of mixing two hydrocarbons, these are present in 100 wt.-% based on the sum of the hydrocarbons and therefore also correspond to claim 1 of the auxiliary request. This feature does not contribute to inventiveness.

3. In summary, it can be stated that the lack of inventive step identified in the decision of the examining division also applies to the restricted sets of claims submitted in the appeal proceedings.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",the application has been refused,the application has been refused,appeal dismissed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeal of the patent holder (appellant) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to revoke patent No. 1 393 741 entitled ""Storage-stable, liquid fibrinogen formulation."" Opponents 1 and 2 are respondents I and II.

II. In the contested decision, the opposition division concluded, among other things, that the patent in dispute did not provide a teaching from which storage-stable, liquid or viscous-liquid fibrinogen formulations exhibiting the storage stability required in claim 1 of the main request ""for at least 1 month at storage temperatures between 0 and 30°C"" could be produced across the entire breadth of the claim. Therefore, the subject matter of the main request did not meet the requirements of Article 83 EPC. Since the feature of storage stability was also included in the claim sets of auxiliary requests 1 to 8, the opposition division concluded that these also did not meet the requirements of Article 83 EPC.

III. With the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant submitted claim sets for a main request and twelve auxiliary requests, with the claim set of the main request being identical to that of the main request underlying the contested decision.

VI. The relevant submissions of the appellant can be summarized as follows:

Main Request - Claim 1

Disclosure of the Invention (Article 83 EPC)

The opposition division concluded that the patent in dispute did not contain a teaching with which storage-stable, liquid or viscous-liquid fibrinogen formulations with the feature of storage stability ""for at least 1 month at storage temperatures between 0°C and 30°C"" could be achieved across the entire scope of the claim. Thus, the subject matter of the main request did not meet the requirements of Article 83 EPC.

However, this view is incorrect. To assess whether the claimed invention meets the requirements of Article 83 EPC, the entire content of the application documents must be considered. A successful objection of insufficient disclosure against the patent in dispute requires substantiated doubts supported by verifiable facts, for which the respondents bear the burden of proof. However, the respondents have not presented any verifiable facts that could substantiate such doubts. These principles were already pointed out in the response to the opposition, page 14, and it was argued that the respondents had not submitted relevant evidence. Furthermore, documents D8a and D10 could not substantiate these doubts. They do not show that a fibrinogen formulation containing divalent metal ions and a complexing agent, but no arginine, does not exhibit the stability required in claim 1.

In the contested decision, the opposition division criticized that the results of Tables 1 and 2 were contradictory to the teaching of claim 1 of the main request (see the paragraph spanning pages 9 and 10 of the decision). However, this statement of the opposition division is not correct. It is true that all three formulations tested in Table 1 exhibited a residual content of coagulation protein of over 90% after one month of storage at 30°C. The test confirms that formulation 3, with a residual content of 99.7%, is particularly stable after one month. However, it is incorrect to state that this example constitutes evidence of lack of enablement. The fact that comparative formulations 1 and 2 also exhibited a comparatively high content of coagulation protein after one month does not contradict the enablement of the invention claimed in claim 1.

The claimed formulations are stable in the temperature range specified in claim 1 of between 0 and 30°C for at least one month. In the examples, temperatures of 2 to 8°C and 30°C were used, meaning it was shown that the formulations according to the invention exhibit the necessary stability at both temperatures that lie within the lower range of the claimed temperature range and at the highest possible storage temperature. Accordingly, the skilled person would have no doubts that the stability indicated in the claim would be achieved at all temperatures. The respondents have not demonstrated that the claimed stability is not achieved.

The data in Tables 3 and 4 are also not contradictory. They disclose several examples of formulations that fall under the wording of claim 1 and are stable. The feature of stability has been defined in the patent, and the skilled person has an easily reproducible method available to verify this feature.

The invention claimed in claim 1 can be implemented with any divalent metal ions and complexing agents. Furthermore, the skilled person knows from the disclosure in the patent or the application and from their general technical knowledge that proteases, e.g., plasminogen, can impair the storage stability of fibrinogen. Therefore, they know that fibrinogen in the claimed fibrinogen formulation should be purified or isolated from proteolytically active components. These measures do not impose an unreasonable burden on the skilled person.

The patent contains sufficient information to determine the concentrations of the divalent metal ions and the complexing agent. The patent also discloses what purity the fibrinogen formulation must have to achieve the required stability.

Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

The respondents have expressed the opinion that the main request does not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. In particular, they have argued that the application only discloses the claimed subject matter in connection with the feature that the complexing agent is present in a higher concentration than the divalent metal ions.

This interpretation of the disclosure of the application is incorrect. On page 10, lines 6 to 20, the patent application describes the complexing agent in more detail. Among other things, the application discloses possible suitable concentrations of the complexing agent. One possibility is to use the complexing agent in a higher concentration than the divalent metal ions. However, other possibilities are also disclosed, namely to use the complexing agent in a concentration of up to 150 mM, up to 50 mM, or up to 25 mM.

The combination of the two features (""complexing agent in a concentration of up to 25 mM"" and ""the complexing agent is present in a higher concentration than the divalent metal ions"") is a possible but purely optional embodiment of the invention, as indicated by the term ""preferably"" on page 10, lines 16 and 17. There is no indication that both features must necessarily be linked.

Claims 20 to 23

Rule 80 EPC (Amendment of the European Patent)

Respondent II has argued that the main request violates Rule 80 EPC, as the amendments to claims 20 and 22 were allegedly not prompted by a ground for opposition under Article 100 EPC. However, in the proceedings before the opposition division, the granted claims 21 and 23 (which correspond to the current claims 20 and 22) were challenged by respondent I under Article 53(c) EPC. The amendments made were therefore prompted by a ground for opposition under Article 100(a) EPC and are thus permissible under Rule 80 EPC.

Exceptions to Patentability (Article 53(c) EPC)

Respondent II claimed that claims 20 and 22 of the main request violated Article 53(c) EPC, as they do not relate to a substance or mixture of substances for use in a therapeutic procedure.

However, the subject matter of claims 20 and 22 is a fibrinogen formulation, i.e., a product and not a procedure or the use of a fibrinogen formulation for the treatment of fibrinogen deficiency states. Thus, the objection under Article 53(c) EPC is not justified.

Disclosure of the Invention (Article 83 EPC)

Claim 23 relates to the use of the fibrinogen formulation as a diagnostic. It is common practice for fibrinogen solutions to be used as a standard for fibrinogen determination. Another application is the use of fibrinogen in thrombin determination. Here, the coagulation time of fibrinogen was measured after the addition of thrombin (see document D28, page 945, right column, section ""Value determination,"" lines 5 to 7).

Thus, the subject matter of claim 23 is also fully disclosed.

VII. The relevant submissions of the respondents can be summarized as follows:

Main Request - Claim 1

Disclosure of the Invention (Article 83 EPC)

The state of the art illustrates the sensitive balance between the specific nature of fibrinogen formulations and the resulting stability profile. For example, the formulations in Example 3 of document D10 (see page 11) meet all structural requirements of claim 1. Whether they also meet the functional (stability) requirements depends on whether they contain tranexamic acid and arginine or not. The conclusion of document D10 is that tranexamic acid and arginine are important for success. However, tranexamic acid is not mentioned in the patent or application, and there are no other indications of how a failure can be turned into success. The skilled person is left unclear about how stability can be achieved within the structural features of claim 1.

Document D8a also teaches that arginine is needed to prevent gelling (see, for example, paragraph [0030] of D8a). The exemplary formulations of the patent also contained arginine. However, it would be an unreasonable burden for the skilled person to determine how much arginine is required to stabilize the formulations at a certain temperature and concentration of divalent metal ions.

Furthermore, the patent in dispute or the application does not disclose how compositions could be produced that are storage-stable across the entire claimed range. In particular, the patent does not disclose any examples of fibrinogen formulations in which the divalent metal ion is not calcium chloride and in which the complexing agent is not citrate. Moreover, the exemplary formulations mentioned contain 0.5, 1.5, or 2.5 mM calcium chloride and always citrate. However, the claims cover all divalent metal ions up to a concentration of 100 mM and all complexing agents up to a concentration of 25 mM. The patent also does not discuss whether a minimum purity of fibrinogen is required. Therefore, the skilled person would have had to conduct experiments to distinguish success from failure.

In the statement of grounds of appeal (see page 12, paragraph 4), the appellant admitted that not all fibrinogen formulations containing up to 100 mM divalent metal ions and up to 25 mM complexing agents are stable and also that the patent does not contain a general teaching on how the skilled person could arrive at such stable compositions.

Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

The opposition division's finding that the claims of the main request comply with Article 123(2) EPC is incorrect, as there is no basis in the application as originally filed for the specific combination of divalent metal ions in a concentration of up to 100 mM and a complexing agent in a concentration of up to 25 mM.

The basis for the specification of the concentration of the complexing agent is found on page 10, lines 18 and 19 of the application, where it states, ""The complexing agent may be present in concentrations of up to 150 mM, preferably up to 50 mM, and particularly preferably up to 25 mM."" This statement must be read in conjunction with the immediately preceding sentence, i.e., on page 10, lines 16 and 18 of the application, ""The complexing agent is preferably present in a higher concentration than the divalent metal ions in the formulation according to the invention."" Since the claim does not reproduce this feature, it violates Article 123(2) EPC.

Claims 20 to 23

Rule 80 EPC (Amendment of the European Patent)

The amendments made in claims 20 to 22 were not prompted by a ground for opposition. For example, the amendment in claim 20 from ""use of a fibrinogen formulation [...] as a preparation for the treatment of fibrinogen deficiency states"" to ""fibrinogen formulation [...] for use as a preparation for the treatment of fibrinogen deficiency states"" leads to a subject matter that is excluded from patentability under Article 53(c) EPC. Thus, the amendments violate Rule 80 EPC, according to which the patent claims may only be amended to the extent that the amendments are prompted by a ground for opposition under Article 100 EPC.

Claim 21 (which corresponds to granted claim 22) does not violate Article 53(c) EPC in its granted form, as a use as ""a component of a fibrin adhesive"" is not a procedure for surgical or therapeutic treatment. Therefore, the amendment of this claim from a ""use"" to a ""product"" is not prompted by a ground for opposition.

Claim 22 in its granted form also does not violate Article 53(c) EPC. In contrast, the amended claim encompasses a subject matter that is excluded from patentability under Article 53(c) EPC.

Exceptions to Patentability (Article 53(c) EPC)

Claims 20 to 23 do not meet the requirements of Article 53(c) EPC because they do not relate to a substance or composition for use in a treatment procedure. Rather, they relate to a formulation for use as a product or as a component. Furthermore, it is questionable whether the use as a component for producing a fibrin matrix is directed towards the treatment of a specific disease.

Disclosure of the Invention (Article 83 EPC)

In paragraph [0024] of the patent, it states that depending on the specific medical use, different fibrinogen formulations according to claims 20 to 23 are required. It would therefore be an unreasonable burden for the skilled person to determine which specific formulation is suitable for each of the uses mentioned in claims 20 to 23.

Regarding claim 23, the patent does not provide any information on how the claimed fibrinogen formulations could be used as a diagnostic, so this claim also violates Article 83 EPC for another reason.

VIII. The parties were summoned to the oral proceedings as requested. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) VOBK 2020, the board communicated its preliminary assessment to the parties.

IX. At the end of the oral proceedings held on June 14, 2022, the chair announced the decision of the board.

X. The appellant requested that the contested decision be overturned and that the patent be maintained in amended form based on the claim set of the main request, or alternatively based on one of the claim sets of auxiliary requests 1 to 12. In the event that a submitted claim set meets the requirements of Rule 80, Article 123(2), Article 123(3), Article 83, and Article 84 EPC, a referral back to the opposition division for examination of the requirements of Articles 54 and 56 EPC was requested. Furthermore, it requested the admission of documents D28 and D29 into the proceedings and the non-admission of documents D24, D25, D26, and D27 submitted by respondent I.

XI. Respondent I requested the dismissal of the appeal.

XII. Respondent II requested the dismissal of the appeal. It also requested a referral back to the opposition division should it become necessary to examine the requirements of Articles 54 and 56 EPC. Furthermore, auxiliary requests 1 to 12 should not be admitted into the proceedings.","Reasons for the Decision

Main Request - Claim 1

Disclosure of the Invention (Article 83 EPC)

1. According to Article 83 EPC, the invention must be disclosed in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for a person skilled in the art to carry it out.

2. The respondents argued that the contested patent or application does not disclose how compositions can be produced that are storage-stable across the entire claimed range. In particular, they stated that no examples of fibrinogen formulations are disclosed where the divalent metal ion is not calcium chloride and where the complexing agent is not citrate. Furthermore, the exemplary formulations mentioned contained 0.5, 1.5, or 2.5 mM calcium chloride and always citrate. However, the claims covered all divalent metal ions up to a concentration of 100 mM and all complexing agents up to a concentration of 25 mM.

3. The respondents further argued that the appellant admitted in its statement of grounds of appeal that not all fibrinogen compositions containing up to 100 mM divalent metal ions and up to 25 mM complexing agents are stable and that the contested patent does not contain a general teaching on how to achieve such stable compositions.

4. Regarding the objection that the examples in the patent or application were limited to formulations containing 0.5, 1.5, or 2.5 mM calcium chloride and 4, 12, or 20 mM citrate, the Board notes that this fact does not prove that the invention cannot be carried out across the entire claimed range. As stated in decision T 617/07 (see point 46 of the reasoning), a sufficient disclosure is not necessarily denied when only a single example of carrying out the invention is provided. Rather, an objection of insufficient disclosure requires (i) serious doubts substantiated by verifiable facts and (ii) depends on the respective evidence.

5. In the present case, the Board has no verifiable facts before it that support the respondents' statements that the claimed invention cannot be carried out. Furthermore, the respondents have not provided evidence that the appellant's assertion that all claimed embodiments are stable is incorrect.

6. Furthermore, the Board notes that the appellant did not concede that not all fibrinogen formulations containing up to 100 mM divalent metal ions and up to 25 mM complexing agents are stable (see statement of grounds of appeal, point 6.7). On the contrary, it maintains that all fibrinogen formulations structurally covered by the claim exhibit the stability defined in the claim. The statement that ""not all fibrinogen compositions containing up to 100 mM divalent metal ions and up to 25 mM complexing agents are stable"" (point 6.7 of the statement of grounds of appeal) referred to cases where the composition, for example, contains additional components (components with proteolytic activity, such as plasminogen) or exhibits extreme pH values.

7. The Board believes that such cases cannot serve as evidence that the skilled person cannot generally carry out the invention, as it is undisputed that the skilled person knew to avoid proteolytically active components and extreme pH values.

8. In the contested decision, the opposition division justified its negative decision on sufficiency of disclosure by stating that stability studies were conducted exclusively with fibrinogen formulations containing Na-citrate, CaCl2, and L-Arg x HCl/pH 7.2. The opposition division also based its decision on the disclosure in Tables 1 and 2, and in Tables 3 and 4, which, in its view, contained contradictory results regarding the claims.

9. The Board cannot follow the opposition division's assessment. Firstly, as argued by the appellant, the examples in the patent do not demonstrate that any of the claimed formulations do not exhibit the claimed stability. Rather, Tables 1 and 2 show that even non-claiming formulations can be stable.

The results disclosed in Tables 3 and 4 are also not contradictory to the claims or to each other. Table 3 shows that both claimed (formulation 5) and comparative formulations (formulation 4) are stable for one month at 30°C. Table 4 shows that the three claimed formulations (5 to 7) are significantly more stable after one month of storage at 30°C than the control formulation (>70.5% remaining fibrinogen compared to about 50% remaining fibrinogen). The results in Table 4 are not contradictory to those in Tables 1 to 3, as they show that the claimed formulations are stable according to the definition in the patent (see paragraph [0015]), which includes the following statement: ""The loss of activity is preferably determined by the method for detecting coagulated protein, as described in the fibrin adhesive monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia (3rd edition (1997), pages 944-946)."" Thus, the data in Tables 3 and 4 are not contradictory, as any differences in measured stability may be attributed to the use of different testing methods.

10. The opposition division's conclusion that the results stated in the patent should be regarded as contradictory, and therefore the skilled person would have to work out through a research program which fibrinogen formulations, selected from a multitude of possible combinations of divalent metal ions and complexing agents, would exhibit the desired stability, cannot be followed, as the Board sees no contradiction in the data present in the patent. Furthermore, the patent also discloses hints at preferred embodiments that should be considered in case of any failures, see e.g. paragraphs [0022] and [0023].

11. Ultimately, the respondents did not raise any serious doubts substantiated by verifiable facts that would demonstrate that the invention cannot be carried out across the entire claimed range.

12. Respondent II further objected that the skilled person would be faced with an unreasonable burden in determining i) the minimum purity of fibrinogen required to achieve a stable fibrinogen formulation, and ii) the specific formulations that are stable at all temperatures between 0 and 30°C.

The Board cannot follow these objections, as no serious doubts substantiated by verifiable facts were raised for these either.

13. According to the respondents, documents D10 and D8a show that tranexamic acid or arginine is necessary to stabilize fibrinogen formulations.

14. The Board cannot follow this view either. Document D10 indicates that tranexamic acid is added as a protease inhibitor (see page 2, last paragraph). As mentioned before, the skilled person knew how to deal with potentially harmful proteases or how to avoid them. The data in Example 3 of document D10 do not support the respondents' argument either, as they relate to attempts to determine stability at 70°C, while the claim requires stability for at least one month at 30°C.

15. The respondents' assertion that document D8a proves that arginine is necessary to stabilize fibrinogen formulations and that the skilled person does not know in what amount it is needed is also unconvincing.

16. Document D8a indicates that arginine is used as a gelling inhibitor (see paragraph [0013]), suggesting that it is not necessarily required for stabilization.

17. In light of the above considerations, the Board concludes that neither the opposition division in the contested decision nor the respondents in their submissions have convincingly demonstrated that the claimed invention does not meet the requirements of Article 83 EPC.

Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

18. The respondents were of the opinion that the main request does not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, as there is no basis in the application as originally filed for the specific combination of divalent metal ions in a concentration of up to 100 mM and a complexing agent in a concentration of up to 25 mM (see section VII.).

19. The Board is not convinced by this argument. In the application, in the section where divalent metal ions are explained (see page 9, last paragraph), it is disclosed that these can have a concentration of up to 100 mM. In the section that contains details about the complexing agent (see page 10, first paragraph), a preferred concentration of up to 25 mM is specified for this.

20. While respondent II rightly noted that the preceding line of the first paragraph on page 10 states that the complexing agent is preferably present in a higher concentration than the divalent metal ions in the formulation according to the invention, the Board interprets the use of ""preferably"" as indicating that this feature is not disclosed as essential. Even in the absence of this feature, the subject matter of the claim is directly and unambiguously disclosed. The claim meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

Claims 20 to 22

Rule 80 EPC

21. Respondent II argued that the amendments made in claims 20 to 22 do not eliminate the objection of non-patentability under Article 53(c) EPC. In the case of claim 21, the amendments are unnecessary as they aim to avoid an objection under Article 53(c) EPC that does not apply to the subject matter in question. Similar objections apply to claim 22.

22. However, the Board believes that Rule 80 EPC only requires that the amendments are prompted by a ground for opposition, which need not be justified, and the amendments do not have to successfully overcome the ground for opposition. In the present case, it is evident that the amendments were made in response to the objections raised by respondent I in its statement of opposition (paragraph 4) against claims 21 to 24. They are therefore not objectionable under Rule 80 EPC.

Article 53(c) EPC

23. The respondents objected to the subject matter of claims 20 to 22 as not conforming to Article 53(c) EPC.

24. Article 53(c) EPC excludes methods for surgical or therapeutic treatment of the human or animal body as well as diagnostic methods performed on the human or animal body from patentability, but also provides that this does not apply to products, in particular substances or mixtures of substances, for use in any of these methods.

25. Claim 20 is a purpose-limited product claim according to Article 54(5) EPC. The mixture is a fibrinogen formulation according to one of claims 1 to 18, and the specific therapeutic application is the treatment of fibrinogen deficiency states. The subject matter of claims 21 and 22 is a fibrinogen formulation, thus a mixture of substances. Since the subject matter of claims 20 to 22 is not methods but mixtures of substances (albeit in the case of claim 20 a purpose-limited one), it cannot fall under the exceptions of Article 53(c) EPC.

Claims 20 to 23

Disclosure of the Invention (Article 83 EPC);

Claim 23

Exceptions to Patentability (Article 53(c) EPC)

26. Respondent II objected to claims 20 to 23 as not conforming to the requirements of Article 83 EPC. Furthermore, respondent I objected that the subject matter of claim 23 is also not in conformity with Article 53(c) EPC. However, the opposition division did not address these issues in the contested decision. The Board therefore decided that these questions should also be addressed by the opposition division, as the case was already referred back to the opposition division for further decision based on other considerations (see point 32 below).

Referral Back (Article 111(1) EPC)

27. The appellant requested that the matter be referred back to the opposition division for further decision should the Board conclude that a submitted set of claims meets the requirements of Rule 80, Article 123(2), Article 123(3), Article 83, and Article 84 EPC.

28. A Board of Appeal acts under Article 111(1) EPC either within the competence of the body that issued the decision or refers the matter back to that body for further decision. Whether the Board decides the case itself or refers the matter back to the opposition division for further decision (Article 111(1) sentence 2 EPC) is to be determined at its discretion.

29. The contested decision only addressed the objections under Article 83 EPC against claim 1 of the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 9, as well as objections against claim 1 of the main request under Article 123(2) EPC and objections under Article 53(c) EPC against claims 20 to 22 and under Rule 80 EPC against claims 20 to 22 of the main request.

30. If the Board were not to refer the matter back to the opposition division, it would have to address all other requirements of the EPC for the first time. This goes beyond the task of judicial review of the contested decision by the Board, as is now explicitly evident from Article 12(2) RPBA 2020. Furthermore, both the appellant and respondent II requested the referral back, and respondent I did not oppose it.

31. In light of this, there are special reasons within the meaning of Article 11 RPBA 2020 that justify referring the matter back to the opposition division for further decision.

32. Therefore, the matter is referred back to the opposition division for further decision, including the consideration of the questions of novelty and inventive step of the subject matter of claim 1, and the remaining aspects of sufficient disclosure and exceptions to patentability (Article 53(c) EPC).","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1.

I. In the decision posted on November 29, 2017, it was established that, taking into account the amendments made by the patent holder during the opposition proceedings according to the then applicable auxiliary request 6, European Patent No. 1 459 701 and the invention it concerns meet the requirements of the Convention.

II. Claim 1 of the auxiliary request 6 underlying the maintenance is directed to a dental set suitable for sulcus retraction.

In contrast, the opposition division had concluded that the method claim of the then auxiliary request 5, which is directed to the use of this dental set, contains a surgical procedure and therefore violates Article 53(c) EPC.

Claim 1 of the then auxiliary request 5 corresponds to Claim 1 of auxiliary request 1a, which the Board 3.3.02 had considered to comply with the provisions of Article 123(2) EPC in a first appeal procedure (see decision T 2450/09, point 4 of the reasons). The matter was then referred back by Board 3.3.02 to the opposition division for further decision (T 2450/09, point 5 of the reasons and point 2 of the decision formula), in particular to clarify whether the claimed subject matter should be considered as excluded from patentability under Article 53(c) EPC in light of the subsequently issued decision G 1/07.

III. The patent holder (appellant) has filed an appeal against the decision of the opposition division in a timely and proper manner.

IV. The appellant is the only party to the proceedings, as the opponent withdrew their opposition by letter dated September 20, 2017, prior to the oral proceedings in the opposition procedure.

V. The appellant requests:

The maintenance of the patent in the scope of the former auxiliary request 2 (now main request, see letter received on March 27, 2019) with a correspondingly adapted description (see letter dated January 29, 2020), alternatively the scheduling of oral proceedings (letter received on March 27, 2019), in case the new main request cannot be granted in the written procedure contrary to expectations.

Claim 1 of this new main request corresponds again to the claim that Board 3.3.02 considered to be compliant with Article 123(2) EPC in decision T 2450/09 (Claim 1 of the then auxiliary request 1a).

VII. Claim 1 according to the main request reads:

""Use of a dental set suitable for sulcus retraction, comprising a hardenable impression material (3) for creating an impression (8), in particular a dental impression (8), and at least one hardenable silicone compound (5), characterized in that the silicone compound (5) exhibits a volume expansion of at least 20%, preferably at least 35% compared to the original volume of the non-hardened compound during curing, wherein a dental impression is first made with the hardenable impression material (3), which is removed after curing, the silicone material (5) is applied to the boundary area between the tooth and the gum margin, and the previously made dental impression is placed back onto the teeth, whereby this impression forms a unilateral boundary for the expansion of the silicone material (5), so that the expansion of the silicone material (5) can only occur towards the sulcus and detaches it from the tooth neck.""

VIII. To support its request, the appellant essentially argued the following:

Article 53(c) EPC

The subject matter of the use claim does not relate to a method excluded from patentability under Article 53(c) EPC.

Documents D4-D6 rather show that the sulcus retraction according to the invention is a non-invasive, non-traumatizing procedure that falls within the competence of dental assistants. As can also be seen from D8 submitted in the appeal proceedings, the cord-free retraction systems lead to atraumatic pressure conditions in the sulcus, so that their application does not cause injury to the marginal epithelium or penetration into the underlying connective tissue. The procedure merely effects a temporary opening of the sulcus. Gingival recessions have not occurred in the context of the application of the procedure. Furthermore, the procedure does not require special medical expertise and is mostly performed in practice by dental assistants, so that the core of the medical profession is not affected.

In summary, the criteria that are supposed to affirm the surgical character of a procedure according to G 1/07 are not fulfilled in the case of the sulcus retraction procedure in question, and the claimed subject matter is therefore not excluded from patent protection.

Novelty

Document D1 discloses a method for sulcus retraction, which also employs an expanding silicone compound. In contrast to the present invention, however, the previously created impression is subsequently processed in such a way that it does not laterally encompass the gum. This results in the expanding silicone material exerting a slight pressure on the gum, which, however, is explicitly insufficient to widen the sulcus. Instead, the patient must generate pressure by biting down after the material has cured to widen the sulcus, which is perceived as very uncomfortable.

Documents D2 and D3 do not disclose any dental set with a hardenable impression material and a silicone mass that cures with volume expansion for widening the sulcus.

The claimed subject matter is therefore novel over the disclosures of documents D1 to D3.

Inventive Step

Document D1 discloses, like the present invention, a method for sulcus retraction and thus represents the closest prior art.

Although the essentially same components are used, the claimed method differs from the teaching of D1 in the points mentioned above.

In particular, no post-processing of the cured impression material is necessary, and the patient does not have to inflict pain on themselves, as is required for sulcus retraction according to D1 by biting down. Instead, sulcus retraction occurs through the volume expansion of the silicone compound.

The objective problem can thus be seen as developing a simpler, time-saving, and more pleasant method for sulcus retraction that also finds greater acceptance among patients.

There is no indication in the prior art for the inventive solution - namely, to efficiently and directly utilize the expansion of the silicone compound for sulcus retraction. The post-processing of the cured impression material disclosed in D1 rather makes this impossible and teaches away from the invention.

Therefore, the subject matter of claim 1 involves an inventive step.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Article 123(2)

In decision T 2450/09, point 4 of the reasons for the decision, the board 3.3.02 found that claim 1 of the present main request complies with the provisions of Article 123(2) EPC. This finding has res judicata effect in the present appeal proceedings.

The subject matter of the dependent claims is based on dependent claims 10-12 as filed.

The requirements of Article 123(2) EPC are thus fulfilled.

2. Article 123(3) EPC

Claim 1 as granted is directed to a dental set suitable for sulcus retraction. Claim 1 of the present main request claims a specific use of a dental set that has all the properties of the dental set according to claim 1 as granted. The change in category does not lead to an extension of the scope of protection (cf. G 2/88).

The requirements of Article 123(3) EPC are therefore fulfilled.

3. Article 53(c) EPC

3.1 Board 3.2.08 has already dealt (in a different composition) with a method for sulcus retraction in case T 2699/17, where the retraction of the sulcus is achieved by the expansion of an elastomeric material in a confined space. The evidence D4, D8, and D8.1-D8.4 presented in this case was thoroughly evaluated (there referred to as D1 and D2.1-D2.5, see T 2699/17, point 1 of the reasons for the decision). The board sees no reason to deviate from the assessment made in T 2699/17, according to which such a method is not excluded from patentability under Article 53(c) EPC.

The arguments supporting the contrary view of the opposition division are discussed below:

3.2 The opposition division initially argues that the patent holder has provided no evidence that the claimed method is inherently safe. The appellant has addressed this accusation at the latest by submitting D8.

3.3 In D8, the managing senior physician and a ""Senior Scientist"" from the University Clinic for Prosthetic Dentistry and Conservative Dentistry in Innsbruck report on their own clinical experiences with the product Magic Foam Cord. Additionally, several relevant scientific papers are discussed. Magic Foam Cord is a curable silicone compound used in the method defined in claim 1.

According to the authors' own clinical experiences in D8, Magic Foam Cord has never caused bleeding throughout the observation period. Gingival recessions, which are more frequently observed after the application of retraction cords, did not occur during the application of Magic Foam Cord (D8, page 2, penultimate paragraph).

3.4 The scientific papers cited in D8 further show that the pressure occurring during the introduction and expansion of the material Magic Foam Cord, averaging 9.0 and 32.8 kPa (D8.2, Benani et al., Table 1), is about two orders of magnitude below the pressure of 2400 kPa recommended in another study for probing periodontal pockets without damaging the periodontal connective tissue fibers (Van der Velden, D8.1, page 112, left column, 2nd paragraph: 0.75N at 0.63 mm probe diameter corresponds to about 2400 kPa; see also D8.2, page 164, first paragraph). It is therefore anatomically/physiologically convincing that the examined expanding material does not cause damage to the periodontal connective tissue during its expansion. Due to the large pressure difference of about two orders of magnitude, extrapolation to other expanding materials covered by the claim is also justified.

3.5 These anatomical observations are confirmed by further clinical studies. In D8.3 (Phatale et al.), teeth on which sulcus retraction with Magic Foam Cord was performed were histopathologically examined after extraction (the teeth showed no periodontal disease but had to be extracted for other reasons). It was found that the sulcus retraction performed using Magic Foam Cord leaves the periodontium intact (D8.3, Abstract, Conclusion) and, in most cases, also the junctional epithelium (D8.3, discussion, 3rd paragraph). Studies on healthy subjects (D8.4, Al Hamad et al, Material and Methods, first paragraph) also confirm the mentioned histopathological findings: The probing depth of the pockets, and thus the connection of the periodontal fibers to the tooth, remained essentially unchanged during sulcus retraction with the material Magic Foam Cord (D8.4, Table 3, ""PD"" and p. 1056, left column, items 6-9). Although there was some gingival irritation, it completely resolved after 7 days (Table 3, ""Gingival Index""). No bleeding occurred when using Magic Foam Cord.

3.6 In light of the evidence presented, the board is of the opinion that the claimed use involves only a minimally invasive step that does not constitute a significant physical intervention on the body and whose execution is not associated with a substantial health risk.

3.7 As an example of a particular risk, the opposition division referred to the disclosure of D4 (decision, page 14, third paragraph). According to D4, page 65, left column, lines 10-15 and page 66, left column, the first two paragraphs under Figure 4, it is essential that no residue of ""FoamCord"" material remains in the sulcus. The gingival sulcus is highly sensitive, and such residual material could lead to periodontal diseases.

D4, page 65, lines 10-15 indeed points out that the sensitive gingiva must not be traumatized to the extent that it results in a lasting retraction. However, this remark is related to the techniques previously used in the prior art, particularly the chemical-mechanical method (inserting a retraction cord with a vasoconstrictor agent). Magic Foam Cord is presented as a new method that does not traumatize the gingiva (see D4, Results and Discussion).

The further mentioned passage (the first two paragraphs under Figure 4) indicates that the setting of the material must be waited for before subsequently (""after proper setting"") the set material and limitation can be removed in one piece. An explicit warning about the danger of periodontal diseases due to residual material remaining in the sulcus is not found here. Rather, it is to be assumed that with the required professional care and competence (cf. G 1/07, headnote 1), removal will occur in one piece, and thus no health risk is posed by residual material in the sulcus.

In the last paragraph of point 6.2 of the reasons for the decision, the opposition division refers to what it considers risks associated with sulcus retraction, such as permanent detachment of the gingiva, inflammation of periodontal pockets, and further consequences up to tooth loss. Such side effects are known for the ""classical"" methods of sulcus retraction (cf. D8.3, page 2, 3rd paragraph or D4, page 65, lines 12-16), but their occurrence for the claimed method remains an unproven assertion. In contrast, the appellant provides convincing evidence with D8 and the scientific publications discussed therein D8.1-D8.4 that such health risks are not observed in the claimed method.

3.8 Delegability / Core Activity of the Medical Profession

Both decision G 1/04 (reasons 6.3) and decision G 1/07 (reasons 3.4.1.) explicitly state that the exclusion of a specific method from patentability cannot depend on who performs that method. The delegability of a method cannot therefore be solely decisive for the assessment of whether a specific method is to be excluded from patentability. It may at most indicate whether a specific method is to be considered part of the ""core activity of the medical profession.""

According to G 1/07, the definition of the term ""surgical treatment"" should cover the types of interventions that ""constitute the core activity of the medical profession, i.e., interventions for which the medical profession is specifically trained and for which doctors assume special responsibility (point 3.4.2.3 of the reasons for the decision).""

However, sulcus retraction is merely a preparatory step for making an impression, typically for creating a crown. The method thus falls within the realm of prosthetic dentistry and not the actual core area of dental practice.

Moreover, the claimed use requires no more than applying the expanding material to the boundary between the tooth and the gingival margin, not an injection into the sulcus. The actual retraction occurs self-regulating, determined by the expansion of the material and the impression held by the opposing dental arch of the patient as a limitation. The person performing the procedure neither actively intervenes in the retraction process nor can they assess how the expansion and the resulting retraction occur, as the expanding material is located inside the impression that limits the expansion. Thus, it is not one of the interventions ""for which the medical profession is specifically trained and for which doctors assume special responsibility.""

Furthermore, according to G 1/07, reasons 3.4.2.3 second paragraph, ""interventions that constitute the core activity of the medical profession"" refer specifically to ""physical interventions on the body"" that require medical expertise and that, even when performed with the required professional care and competence, are associated with a health risk. Such a narrow interpretation ""excludes methods from the scope of the exception that are uncritical and involve only a minimal intervention and no substantial health risk when performed with the required care and competence.""

From the context in point 3.4.2.4 of G 1/07, it follows that the criterion ""interventions that constitute the core activity of the medical profession"" should not be understood as an independent criterion for exclusion from patentability as a surgical method. To justify such an exclusion, the intervention, even if it belongs to the type of interventions that constitute the core activity of the medical profession, must be associated with a substantial health risk. In other words, it must still exhibit a ""surgical character"" to be considered a method for the surgical treatment of the human or animal body within the meaning of Article 53(c) EPC. Interventions that are uncritical and involve only a minimal intervention and no substantial health risk when performed with the required care and competence are not intended to be covered by G 1/07.

Since it is demonstrated in D8 and the works cited therein D8.1-8.4 that there is no substantial health risk for the claimed method, the method cannot be excluded from patentability as a surgical method.

As merely a preparatory step for making an impression, the method is also not to be regarded as a method for the therapeutic treatment of the human or animal body.

4. Novelty

4.1 D1 discloses the making of an impression and the application of silicone material to the boundary between the tooth and the gingival margin, with the reapplication of the produced dental impression onto the teeth.

However, the dental impression is first processed so that space is created laterally in the impression, and no forces are exerted by the impression on the sulcus when it is reapplied (D1a page 2, penultimate paragraph, particularly line 20). The silicone material expands after the processing of the impression in the method described in D1, but unlike the invention, it cannot only expand towards the sulcus but also into the previously created recess of the impression. The expansion of the silicone material does not explicitly cause retraction of the sulcus (D1, translation submitted on March 18, 2008, page 2, lines 18-21: ""...during its volumetric expansion, it [i.e. the polymerizing Gengifoam material] exerts a small thrust onto tissues, though not to a sufficient extent to cause an appreciable shift of gingival margins""). The retraction of the sulcus is rather produced only after the expansion of the silicone material by biting down (the expansion merely creates a well-fitting impression), see D1, translation submitted on March 18, 2008, page 8, line 21 - page 9, line 13).

The method according to D1 thus differs from the claimed method, where the impression forms a unilateral limitation for the expansion of the silicone material, so that the expansion of the silicone material can only occur towards the sulcus and detach it from the tooth neck.

4.2 The method according to D2 also uses an expanding silicone compound (""foam"", Figure 6, 7, No. 9), but without first making a dental impression with a curable impression material, which is then removed and only after applying the expanding material is reapplied to the teeth to act as a unilateral limitation for the expansion. Instead, an ""appliance"" (column 6, lines 30ff), a ""dental spatula"" (column 6, last sentence), or ""carrier 20"" (column 7, 2nd paragraph or column 2, lines 56-65) is used to hold the expanding material in place and create counterpressure with a finger or the opposing dental arch, which then leads to the desired sulcus retraction (column 7, lines 19-27).

4.3 The method for sulcus retraction according to D3 uses an impression and a ""flowable material."" Unlike the invention, the ""flowable material,"" e.g., vinyl polysiloxane, is not applied to the boundary between the tooth and the gingival margin but into the impression. Furthermore, although curing of the ""flowable materials"" is disclosed, there is no disclosure of a volume expansion of the material of at least 20%. Rather, the mentioned example material, vinyl polysiloxane, is known for minimal dimensional change during polymerization (see D9, page 428, right column, second paragraph: ""There is minimal dimensional change during this polymerization....""). The sulcus retraction is primarily achieved by the astringent present in the ""flowable material,"" which leads to a retraction of the sulcus from the tooth neck due to tissue contraction.

4.4 Therefore, none of documents D1 to D3 are detrimental to the novelty of the claimed method.

5. Inventive Step

5.1 D3 as the closest prior art in combination with the teaching of D2 (cf. Notice of Opposition, point 4)

Document D3 is acknowledged in the patent itself (paragraph [0003]) as the closest prior art.

As discussed in point 4.3, the claimed method differs from that disclosed in D3 in that the curable material does cure, but does not exhibit a volume expansion of at least 20% compared to the original volume as claimed, and is introduced into the impression rather than applied to the boundary between the tooth and the gingival margin.

According to paragraph [0004] of the patent, the direct application of the curable material avoids smearing when inserting the impression, and the material can be better dosed quantitatively at the boundary than in an impression.

The objective of the invention can therefore be seen - in line with the objective formulated in the patent, paragraph [0005] - as avoiding the disadvantages of applying the curable material in the impression and providing an alternative method for exposing the tooth neck.

D2 indeed discloses an alternative method for exposing the tooth neck, for which an expanding material is used. However, due to the large expansion rate of at least 150%, there is no reason to limit the material as in D3 by a previously cumbersome impression of the dental arch. A ""spatula"" or ""carrier"" as described in D2 suffices. The skilled person would therefore, in search of an alternative method for exposing the tooth neck, possibly apply the teaching of D2, but would arrive at a method without using a previously made impression with a curable impression material. The contrary argumentation in the Notice of Opposition is based on a retrospective view.

5.2 D1 as the closest prior art

The distinguishing feature mentioned in point 4.1, whereby the dental impression forms a unilateral limitation for the expansion of the silicone material, so that the expansion of the silicone material can only occur towards the sulcus and detach it from the tooth neck, is not found in D2 or D3.

As discussed in point 5.1, no impression is used as a limitation for the expanding material in D2, but rather a ""carrier"" or an ""appliance."" A combination with the teaching of D2 cannot therefore lead to the invention according to claim 1. Similarly, a combination with the teaching of D3 does not lead to the invention, as no curable silicone compound with a volume expansion of at least 20% is disclosed there.

The subject matter of claim 1 thus also involves an inventive step over the combination of the teachings of D1 with D2 or D3.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2.

I. The appeal of the appellant (opponent) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to reject the opposition against patent EP 2 470 496 under Article 101(2) EPC.

II. In the course of the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged under Articles 100(a) and 100(b) EPC for lack of novelty, lack of inventive step, and lack of sufficiency of disclosure.

The patent claims a process for the production of crystalline methylglycine-N,N-diacetate derivatives (MGDA). The opposition division concluded in the contested decision that the claimed process is sufficiently disclosed (Article 83 EPC). Novelty over D2 is given (Article 54 EPC). The claimed process also involves an inventive step starting from D3 as the closest prior art (Article 56 EPC). The auxiliary request submitted by the patent proprietor was therefore not further considered.

III. The following documents were cited in the proceedings:

""Experimental Report I"", ""Experimental Report II"": Experimental reports submitted on October 17, 2017, in the opposition proceedings|

IV. In her appeal and in further proceedings, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

The process claimed in the patent is not novel over D2 (Article 54 EPC). In particular, D2 discloses the characteristic feature of the claimed process, namely the provision of crystalline material. The characteristic feature of the process defined in the patent proprietor's auxiliary request, namely the use of an aqueous solution as the starting product, is also described there. Furthermore, the claimed process lacks inventive step starting from D3 (Article 56 EPC). Moreover, the process is not described in a manner that allows it to be carried out (Article 83 EPC). To support her arguments, the appellant referred to document D11 submitted in the appeal proceedings, to documents D9 and D10 submitted in the opposition proceedings, as well as to the experimental reports, which she believes were wrongly not admitted into the proceedings by the opposition division.

V. In her appeal and in further proceedings, the respondent essentially argued as follows:

The decision of the opposition division is correct. The characteristic feature of the process defined in the granted patent is not disclosed in D2, nor is that of the auxiliary request. Starting from D3, the claimed process is not suggested. The process is described in a manner that allows it to be carried out; the late-submitted documents and experimental reports in the opposition proceedings were rightly not considered. Document D11 submitted in the appeal proceedings should not be admitted into the proceedings.

VI. On August 12, 2020, the Board issued a communication under Rule 100(2) EPC, informing the parties of the preliminary assessment of the factual and legal situation.

The Board was preliminarily of the opinion that the novelty of the independent claim of the granted patent over D2 is not given. In contrast, the process claimed in the auxiliary request is novel. Regarding inventive step and sufficiency of disclosure, the Board provisionally agreed with the opinion of the opposition division and considered both to be given. The question of the admission of the documents and experimental reports submitted in the opposition proceedings does not seem to be decisive.

VII. In letters dated December 21, 2020, and December 16, 2020, the parties responded to the Board's communication. The appellant submitted document D11 to support her arguments regarding Article 83 EPC. The respondent presented arguments for the novelty of the claims of the granted patent.

VIII. On January 20, 2021, the Board summoned the parties to oral proceedings on November 9, 2021.

IX. The oral proceedings took place on November 9, 2021. The final requests of the parties were as follows:

The appellant requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of European Patent No. 2 470 496 in its entirety. Furthermore, she requested the admission of documents D9, D10, D11, and the experimental reports into the proceedings.

The respondent requested the dismissal of the appeal, i.e., the dismissal of the opposition as the main request, alternatively the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent in amended form based on auxiliary request 1 submitted with the letter of March 14, 2017, and re-submitted with the response to the appeal on September 14, 2018.

Additionally, she requested that documents D9, D10, D11, and the experimental reports not be admitted into the proceedings.

X. At the end of the oral proceedings, the decision was announced.

XI. The independent claim of the contested patent reads as follows:

""Process for the production of a crystalline solid, which - based on the solid content - comprises 70 to 99.9 wt.% methylglycine-N,N-diacetate derivatives of the general formula I

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

wherein each M independently means hydrogen, alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium in the corresponding stoichiometric amounts, whereby the solid retains its consistency as granulate during open storage at below 25°C and a relative humidity of 76% over a period of at least one day,

characterized in that at least one crystalline compound of formula I is provided and a spray granulation is carried out with at least one compound of formula I.""

The independent claim of the auxiliary request differs from this in the characterizing part as follows:

""characterized in that at least one crystalline compound of formula I is provided and a spray granulation is carried out with [deleted: at least] an aqueous solution of a compound of formula I.""","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Admission of documents and experimental reports into the proceedings.

2.1 D11

D11 was submitted during the appeal proceedings in response to the communication issued under Rule 100(2) EPC within the set deadline. The admission of this document into the appeal proceedings is therefore at the discretion of the Board in accordance with Article 13(1) RPBA 2020.

D11 is a post-published document and was submitted to reinforce the objection under Article 83 EPC. D11 is intended to show that a product marketed by the patent holder, which the appellant believes was produced according to the method claimed in the contested patent, does not meet the stability parameters defined in claim 1 of the contested patent.

The appellant argues that D11 was found in the context of a supplementary search for experimental data regarding particular compositions of MDGA. This search became necessary after the appellant became aware of the preliminary opinion of the Board, as the Board did not follow the objection raised in the statement of grounds of appeal under Article 83 EPC.

The Board sees no justification for submitting D11 only at this stage of the proceedings. The opposition division had already expressed in its summons to the oral proceedings on April 21, 2017, the preliminary opinion that the objections of the then-opponent were not substantiated. By this time at the latest, the appellant should have acted if it wanted to conduct further investigations. The opposition division then confirmed its preliminary opinion in the contested decision. The fact that the Board aligned itself with the assessment of the opposition division in its preliminary opinion does not introduce any new facts that could justify a new presentation by the appellant using new evidence according to Article 13(1) RPBA 2020.

Furthermore, D11 does not mention anywhere that the product referred to therein, Trilon® SG, was produced according to the method claimed in the contested patent. The appellant cannot therefore claim that this document is prima facie relevant to the present decision.

D11 is therefore not admitted into the appeal proceedings.

2.2 D9, D10, and the experimental reports from the opposition proceedings

These documents were submitted by the appellant during the opposition proceedings but were not admitted into the proceedings by the opposition division. As explained below, these documents are irrelevant for the present decision, see points 6.2 and 6.4 below. Whether these documents were wrongly not admitted into the opposition proceedings, as claimed by the appellant, remains open.

Main Request - Patent as Granted

3. Novelty

3.1 D2 was published one day after the priority date of the contested patent and is prior art under Article 54(3) EPC. This was undisputed.

3.2 D2 discloses the production of granules from methylglycine-N,N-diacetic acid derivatives (MGDA) by spray granulation. The products are free-flowing and only slightly hygroscopic (see page 10, lines 4-9). Details of the claimed method are described from page 8, line 18 onwards. Example 1 details such a method; in the course of this method, MGDA powder is added at the beginning as seed particles. According to the appellant, D2 is therefore detrimental to the novelty of claim 1 of the granted patent.

3.3 According to the opposition division and the respondent, the novelty-defining feature compared to D2 is that D2 does not present a ""crystalline compound of formula I,"" as required in claim 1 of the contested patent.

The respondent argues that D2 does not disclose the provision of a compound I, let alone the provision of crystalline material.

3.3.1 The respondent believes that the claim requires the provision of crystalline material in the granulator itself and therefore (implicitly) a two-step process, i.e., the provision of a compound I as a crystallization seed in the granulator before the actual spray granulation. It refers, in addition to general usage, to paragraph [0009] of the patent, which states two alternatives, namely the generation of the seeds in situ or their provision. A provision of material in the granulator before the start of spray granulation is not disclosed in D2. Any addition of seed particles in D2 refers to the addition to the suspension used in the granulation.

The Board, however, agrees with the appellant that a two-step process is not required by the claim. The claim does not require that the crystalline material be provided in powder form, nor that the provision must occur as a separate process step in the granulator before the actual spray granulation.

On page 8, line 18 to page 9, line 9 of D2, it is generally disclosed that crystalline suspensions are used as starting materials for the process. In the Board's view, this approach is compliant with the claim even without the further addition of seed particles, as the claim does not define how the crystalline material should be provided. Furthermore, it is explicitly described in D2 (page 9, lines 4-6) that the product is formed by solvent evaporation when small amounts of the starting suspension are sprayed onto the seed particles while they are in the fluid state in the warm gas stream. The seed particles are therefore provided in the gas stream in the granulator, as required by the claim.

Moreover, it is explicitly stated in Example 1 that seed particles are added at the beginning of the process. This corresponds to the provision required by the claim, as the claim does not further define the manner of provision.

Furthermore, as pointed out by the appellant, the respondent itself, when assessing the prior art during the examination proceedings, indicated in paragraph [0004] of the patent, referring to D2, that MGDA powder is provided as a seed.

3.3.2 The respondent further argues that D2 does not explicitly disclose that the provided material is crystalline, as required by the claim.

The Board finds this argument unconvincing.

Firstly, D2 does describe, as stated above, the use of crystalline suspensions as the starting material for granulation. Since, as also stated above, this is compliant with the claim, there is no doubt about the crystallinity of the particles; this is explicitly described in D2.

Moreover, Example 1 states verbatim: ""At the start a small quantity of MGDA powder was added as seed particles."" This powder must also be regarded as at least partially crystalline. It is true that its crystallinity is not explicitly disclosed. The respondent has argued that it could also be amorphous material. It referred to several places in D2 where the term ""powder"" is mentioned in connection with hygroscopic powders, for example, page 1, line 29 or page 3, line 27.

Nevertheless, the Board considers the assumption that the powder used in Example 1 is entirely amorphous material to be unrealistic. Amorphous MGDA is hygroscopic and therefore cannot be stored as powder (see D2 page 1, last paragraph, see also the present patent paragraphs [0002] and [0003]). The production of such amorphous powder immediately before spray granulation for the purpose of seeding is not mentioned in D2. The references cited by the respondent to the term ""powder"" in D2 refer to amorphous products obtained by spray drying from the prior art, not to powders used as seed particles in the context of D2.

Furthermore, D2 explicitly describes the purpose of the seed particles as crystallization seeds (page 8, lines 30ff.). The term ""seed particles"" for crystal growth implies, as correctly pointed out by the appellant, a certain crystallinity of the particles under normal circumstances. This is even more true in the present case, where the instability of amorphous powder is well known.

3.4 Claim 1 of the granted patent is therefore not novel over D2.

Auxiliary Request

4. Novelty

4.1 Claim 1 of the auxiliary request additionally requires that the spray granulation is carried out with an aqueous solution of a compound of formula (I).

4.2 In the Board's opinion, this feature is not disclosed in D2. D2 does not use solutions, but suspensions (""slurry"") are spray granulated, see for example claim 1.

4.3 The appellant has argued that a suspension always contains a solution, in addition to an insoluble solid.

While this may be correct in itself, ""solution"" and ""suspension"" are terms that denote two different things for the skilled person. The claim requires that the process is carried out with a solution. This is not the case in D2.

4.4 The appellant specifically referred to Example 1, which explicitly states in the introductory sentence that aqueous solutions (""aqueous solutions"") are used for granulation.

However, the Board agrees with the respondent that this sentence must be read in conjunction with the rest of the text of the example and also with the general teaching of D2.

From the general teaching of D2, it is evident that the process described there concerns the spray granulation of suspensions, see claim 1. This is also stated in the description, see page 8, lines 18ff. In Example 1, it is described after the sentence cited by the appellant that a suspension (""slurry"") is heated and spray granulated. The appellant has argued that when heating the suspension, the material would go into solution, so that in truth a solution would be spray granulated. However, there is no support for such an interpretation of the process in D2. There are also no solubility data available from which such behavior could be inferred.

A spray granulation of aqueous solutions is therefore not disclosed in D2.

4.5 The process defined in the claims of the auxiliary request is therefore novel over D2.

5. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

5.1 D2 is not prior art under Article 56 EPC. This was undisputed.

5.2 The opposition division and the parties consider D3 to be the closest prior art. The Board agrees with this.

D3 discloses the production of crystalline, non-hygroscopic MGDA. A crystallization process is used for this. D3 also discloses that, in contrast to crystallization, the use of a classical spray drying process and a spray drying process followed by compaction and addition of benzoic acid does not yield a stable product (comparative examples A and B in D3).

5.3 The objective problem can be seen as finding an alternative production method for crystalline, non-hygroscopic MGDA.

The claimed solution to the problem is the use of the spray granulation process defined in claim 1 of the auxiliary request.

5.4 The appellant has objected that the patent does not show that such a product is actually obtained, as in the example of the patent the stability parameter defined in the claim was not determined.

The Board does not agree with this objection. The example states that the product is obtained ""in the desired quality."" Since this quality is defined in paragraph [0017] in accordance with the patent claim, it must be assumed until proven otherwise that this is the case.

The appellant has also argued that the example refers only to a specific compound, while the claim extends to derivatives with various cations M. It has not been proven that the process also leads to products with the desired properties with other salts.

This objection is equally unconvincing. There are neither convincing technical arguments nor data presented that would show that the process is not feasible with other salts.

Therefore, the Board assumes that the technical problem has been solved.

5.5 The question to be decided is whether a skilled person could assume that spray granulation would, like the crystallization described in D3, be a suitable technique to obtain non-hygroscopic, stable, crystalline MGDA.

Spray granulation is itself an undisputed known process, as described for example in D4 or D8. The appellant has argued that the application of this known process to the compounds (I) does not require inventive step.

5.5.1 The contested decision states that D3 advises against spray processes because they would lead to amorphous products (column 1, lines 10ff.). The Board finds this argument unconvincing. The passage in D3 refers to spray drying, not to spray granulation, and does not specifically refer to the product MGDA, but is a general summary of the prior art.

The cited passages of D3 would therefore not deter the skilled person from using spray granulation.

5.5.2 Nevertheless, the Board is convinced that a skilled person searching for a solution to the technical problem of producing crystalline, non-hygroscopic MGDA could not assume that the claimed spray granulation process would be an alternative to the crystallization process of D3. As stated in the contested decision, MGDA is a substance with problematic crystallization behavior, see D3, column 1, lines 25ff. There is no indication in the cited documents that the technique of spray granulation with the provision of crystalline material would yield MDGA in the desired form. The documents cited by the appellant, D4 and D8, provide general descriptions of spray granulation; the appellant has not highlighted any passages that could give the skilled person a hint that this method would be promising in the case of hygroscopic or otherwise difficult-to-crystallize substances.

5.6 The process defined in claim 1 of the auxiliary request is therefore based on inventive step starting from D3.

6. Sufficiency of Disclosure (Article 83 EPC)

6.1 The appellant has raised a number of reasons why, in its opinion, the claimed process is not sufficiently disclosed.

6.2 It was argued that the claim contains poorly defined features. In particular, reference was made to the purity degree concerning the solid content of 70-99.9%, the stability parameter (one day of consistency maintenance at 76% humidity), and the feature ""provided."" In connection with the purity degree, reference was made to D9, D10, and the experimental report ""Experimental Report I,"" all of which were submitted in the opposition proceedings but, according to the appellant, were wrongly not admitted into the proceedings. It was also criticized that the claim sometimes refers to crystalline ""solid,"" and at other times to crystalline ""compound.""

The Board cannot agree with this. Article 83 EPC requires that the skilled person can carry out the claimed invention, here the claimed process, and arrive at the products defined in the claim. This is evidently possible, as shown in the example.

The question of how exactly the solid content is defined, to which the purity of the product refers, concerns the question of whether a specific process falls under the claims or not. This is a question of clarity under Article 84 EPC and is not subject to discussion according to G 03/14. The same applies to the question of how the feature ""provided"" is to be interpreted, and whether a specific material meets the stability properties defined in the claim or not. Furthermore, a skilled person knows what is meant by the terms ""solid"" and ""compound."" These so-called ""poorly defined features"" do not in any case lead to a situation where a skilled person cannot carry out the claimed process.

A decision on whether the non-admission of D9, D10, and ""Experimental Report I"" by the opposition division was justified or not is therefore unnecessary.

6.3 The appellant has stated that the example of the patent only concerns a specific salt of MGDA, namely the trisodium salt. For no other salt has the feasibility been demonstrated.

While this is correct, the appellant has also not presented any data or substantiated technical arguments as to why the process should not work with other salts of formula (I). This objection is therefore not convincing.

6.4 The appellant has complained that various process parameters are not sufficiently described in the patent, which is why the claimed process is not executable for the skilled person. To illustrate, the experimental report ""Experimental Report II,"" which the appellant submitted in the opposition proceedings but was not admitted there, is cited.

The Board notes the following: The patent generally defines the relevant parameters (see paragraph [0011]). The example reveals specific values for these parameters in paragraph [0027], which the skilled person can refer to. A skilled person can therefore carry out the claimed process without having to start a research program, as argued by the appellant. Individual failures are inconsequential as long as the skilled person can refer to the teaching of the patent and their general technical knowledge to achieve success.

Regardless of whether ""Experimental Report II"" should have been admitted by the opposition division or was rightly not admitted, the Board notes that this report does not specify various parameters listed in paragraph [0011] of the patent (e.g., temperature and pressure of the spray air, temperature of the spray solution) at all. It is therefore unclear whether the process carried out there follows the indications of the contested patent or not. This report is thus not suitable to show that the claimed process is not executable.

A decision on whether the non-admission of ""Experimental Report II"" by the opposition division was justified or not is therefore unnecessary.

6.5 The question raised by the appellant regarding whether essential features are specified in the claim is clearly a question of clarity, as this condition is mentioned in Rule 43(3) EPC, which implements Article 84 EPC. Article 83 EPC requires that the claimed process must be described in an executable manner for the skilled person, and not that all necessary information must be specified in the claim. This question is therefore not subject to the proceedings according to G 03/14.

6.6 The objections raised under Article 83 EPC do not therefore preclude the maintenance of the patent.

7. Referral for Adaptation of the Description

7.1 The amended claims in the form of the auxiliary request meet the relevant requirements of the EPC. The patent is therefore to be maintained on the basis of the claims of the auxiliary request under Article 101(3)(a) EPC.

I. The present decision concerns the appeal of the opponent (appellant) against the interim decision of the opposition division (challenged decision), which found that the main request pending before the opposition division meets the requirements of the EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the appellant requested the revocation of the contested patent in its entirety based on the grounds for opposition under Article 100 a) EPC (lack of novelty and lack of inventive step), Article 100 b) EPC, and Article 100 c) EPC.

III. In the oral proceedings before the opposition division, the appellant submitted the following two documents:

D24    US 2008/0260736 A1

D25    WO 2004/024159 A1

The opposition division admitted D24, but not D25, into the proceedings. The opposition division decided that the main request pending before it

- meets the requirements of Articles 123 (2), 84, 83, and 54 EPC

- is based on an inventive step starting from D24 as the closest prior art.

IV. In its statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant requested

- the annulment of the challenged decision and the revocation of the contested patent in its entirety

- the admission of D25 into the proceedings.

Furthermore, an oral hearing was requested.

In its response to the appeal, the patent proprietor (respondent) requested the dismissal of the appeal.

V. In preparation for the oral hearing scheduled at the request of the appellant, the Board issued a communication pursuant to Article 15 (1) RPBA 2020.

VI. By letter dated May 11, 2021, the appellant withdrew its request for an oral hearing and announced that it would not attend. The Board then canceled the oral hearing.

VII. The relevant arguments of the appellant for the present decision can be summarized as follows.

The reasoning provided in the challenged decision regarding the requirements of Articles 83 and 56 EPC, as well as regarding the non-admission of D25 into the proceedings, is incorrect.

The contested patent does not contain sufficient information for the skilled person regarding when a connection should be considered as a Hepcidin antagonist. Furthermore, the contested patent does not specify the exact mechanism of action responsible for the antagonistic effect. Therefore, the invention according to the claims of the main request is not sufficiently disclosed.

Document D25 is prima facie relevant and should therefore be admitted.

The claimed subject matter of the main request does not involve an inventive step in view of a combination of D24 as the closest prior art with D25.

VIII. The relevant arguments of the respondent for the present decision can be summarized as follows.

The reasoning in the challenged decision is to be agreed with, and the appeal should therefore be dismissed.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The main request of the respondent is directed towards the rejection of the appeal and thus implies the maintenance of the contested patent in the version deemed allowable by the opposition division, i.e., in the form of the main request pending before the opposition division.

The independent claims of this main request have the following wording.

Claim 1

""Hepcidin antagonists of the general formula (I')

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

wherein

X has the meaning of C-R**(1), wherein

R**(1) is selected from the group consisting of:

- Hydrogen,

- Halogen,

- optionally substituted alkyl,

- optionally substituted alkoxy

R**(2) and R**(3) are the same or different, and are each selected from the group consisting of:

- Hydrogen,

- Hydroxyl,

- Halogen,

- Carboxyl,

- Sulfonic acid residue (-SO**(3)H),

- optionally substituted aminocarbonyl,

- optionally substituted aminosulfonyl,

- optionally substituted amino,

- optionally substituted alkyl,

- optionally substituted acyl,

- optionally substituted alkoxycarbonyl,

- optionally substituted acyloxy,

- optionally substituted alkoxy,

- optionally substituted alkenyl,

- optionally substituted alkynyl,

- optionally substituted aryl,

- optionally substituted heterocyclic;

R**(4) and R**(5) are the same or different, and are each selected from the group consisting of:

- Hydrogen,

- optionally substituted amino,

- optionally substituted alkyl, aryl, or heterocyclic sulfonyl,

- optionally substituted alkyl,

- optionally substituted alkenyl,

- optionally substituted alkynyl,

- optionally substituted acyl,

- optionally substituted aryl,

- optionally substituted heterocyclic or

- wherein R**(4) and R**(5) together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bound form a saturated or unsaturated, optionally substituted 3- to 8-membered ring, which may optionally contain further heteroatoms;

or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,

for use in the treatment of iron deficiency diseases and/or iron deficiency anemias.""

Claim 6

""Composition comprising one or more of the Hepcidin antagonists as defined in one or more of claims 1 to 5, as well as one or more pharmaceutical carriers and/or excipients and/or solvents, for use in the treatment of iron deficiency diseases and/or iron deficiency anemias.""

Claim 7

""Combination preparation comprising one or more of the Hepcidin antagonists as defined in one or more of claims 1 to 5, as well as at least one further compound for the treatment of iron metabolism disorders and the associated symptoms, preferably an iron-containing compound, for use in the treatment of iron metabolism disorders.""

Thus, these claims relate to second medical uses of the Hepcidin antagonists of formula (I') (claim 1) as well as a composition or combination preparation containing them (claims 6 and 7). The actual medical indications are iron deficiency diseases and/or iron deficiency anemias (claims 1 and 6) or iron metabolism disorders (claim 7).

The mechanism of action of Hepcidin in the organism is based on its binding to Ferroportin, i.e., the protein responsible for the transport of iron from enterocytes into the blood (contested patent, paragraphs [0008] and [0013]). The complex resulting from the binding is transported into the cell (internalized) and degraded there. This reduces the release of iron into the blood. If there is too much Hepcidin present, this can lead to anemia due to the resulting iron deficiency in the blood.

2. Sufficient Disclosure

2.1 The appellant argued that the invention of the claims of the main request is not sufficiently disclosed because the contested patent does not provide the skilled person with adequate information on when a compound can be considered a Hepcidin antagonist, i.e., up to what IC50 upper limit antagonism can still be claimed.

Furthermore, various possible mechanisms of action for Hepcidin antagonists are listed in paragraph [0020] of the contested patent. However, it is not clear from the contested patent which specific mechanism the antagonistic effect is based on, i.e., for example, whether the compounds of formula (I') bind to Hepcidin or Ferroportin.

2.2 The Board does not find these arguments convincing, essentially for the reasons already stated in the contested decision.

The contested patent (paragraphs [0020] and [0021]) defines Hepcidin antagonists as compounds that

- bind to Hepcidin or Ferroportin, thereby inhibiting the binding of Hepcidin to Ferroportin, and thus preventing the inactivation of Ferroportin by Hepcidin,

- prevent the internalization of the Hepcidin-Ferroportin complex even when Hepcidin is bound to Ferroportin, and thereby prevent the inactivation of Ferroportin by Hepcidin.

In short, these are compounds that prevent the degradation of Ferroportin initiated by internalization. Using the assay described in the contested patent (paragraphs [0174] to [0178]), such compounds can now be identified that can block the Hepcidin-induced internalization of Ferroportin. Thus, this assay allows determining whether the compound in question is a Hepcidin antagonist in the sense of the contested patent or not. For the question of sufficient disclosure, it is therefore irrelevant what extent the antagonistic effect has (i.e., what order of magnitude the IC50 value is) or which mechanism it is based on at the molecular level.

Moreover, the appellant has not demonstrated that not all compounds according to formula (I') are Hepcidin antagonists. The burden of proof in this regard would have rested with her (case law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, ninth edition, 2019, II.C.9). Therefore, the Board has no reason to doubt that all compounds according to formula (I') are Hepcidin antagonists.

In summary, the invention of the claims of the main request meets the requirements of Article 83 EPC.

3. Admission of D25

3.1 In the oral proceedings before the opposition division, the appellant submitted D24 and D25. Since these were late-filed documents, their admission was at the discretion of the opposition division (Article 114 (2) EPC). The opposition division assessed both documents regarding their relevance and decided to admit D24, but not D25.

In her statement of appeal, the appellant again referred to D25 and explained why the opposition division's decision not to admit this document was incorrect. She accordingly requested that this document be admitted into the proceedings.

3.2 Regarding first-instance discretionary decisions, the principles established in G 7/93 (OJ EPO 1994, 775; No. 2.6 of the reasons) apply. A Board of Appeal should only override the manner in which the first instance exercised its discretion if it concludes that the first instance did not exercise its discretion according to the correct criteria or in an unreasonable manner, thereby exceeding the discretion granted to it.

3.3 In deciding on the admission of the late-filed document D25, the relevance criterion applied by the opposition division is the correct criterion.

Regarding the question of whether this criterion was exercised in an unreasonable manner, the appellant argued that the opposition division had clearly misjudged the value of D25. D24 reveals that Hepcidin antagonists can be used for the treatment of iron deficiency diseases and that this effect can be induced by antagonists of members of the TGF-β superfamily. Since D25 discloses compounds that are antagonists of members of the TGF-β superfamily and fall under formula (I') in claim 1, the subject matter of claim 1 arises in an obvious manner from a combination of D24 and D25. D25 is therefore prima facie relevant and should be admitted.

In its communication pursuant to Article 15 (1) VOBK 2020, the Board explained why this reasoning does not align with the disclosure of D24. Contrary to the appellant's assertion, D24 does not disclose that antagonists of members of the TGF-β superfamily act as Hepcidin antagonists. Rather, D24 (paragraphs [0012] and [0057]) discloses the use of members of the TGF-β superfamily and their agonists to reduce Hepcidin activity, and thus that members of the TGF-β superfamily and their agonists can act as Hepcidin antagonists. Accordingly, according to the teaching of D24, only members of the TGF-β superfamily and their agonists are suitable for the treatment of iron deficiency diseases (paragraphs [0014] and [0017]). Starting from D24, the skilled person would therefore have had no reason to turn to the antagonists of members of the TGF-β superfamily disclosed in D25. As already noted by the opposition division, the Board also does not consider document D25 to be prima facie relevant. The Board therefore sees no reason to overturn the opposition division's discretionary decision and admit this document into the proceedings (Article 25 (2) VOBK 2020 in conjunction with Article 12 (4) VOBK 2007).

4. Inventive Step

4.1 The only objection of the appellant regarding a lack of inventive step was based on D24 as the closest prior art. Although the claimed subject matter of the main request differs from D24 in terms of the structure of the Hepcidin antagonists, corresponding compounds are disclosed in D25. A combination of D24 and D25 would therefore lead in an obvious manner to the claimed subject matter of the main request.

4.2 Since the above objection is based on a combination of documents, one of which (D25) has not been admitted into the proceedings (see point 3), it cannot succeed.

4.3 The opposition division recognized inventive step starting from D24 in the contested decision. In the absence of further objections from the appellant, the Board also concludes that the claimed subject matter of the main request is based on an inventive step. The main request is therefore allowable.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,appeal dismissed,Syngenta Crop Protection AG,Syngenta Crop Protection AG Rosentalstrasse 67 4058 Basel / CH,SYNGENTA IP WRO B8-Z1-30 Rosentalstrasse 67 4058 Basel / CH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. European Patent No. 2 023 888 was granted with 14 claims. Claim 1 of the patent reads as follows:

""1. Cosmetic oil-in-water emulsion that does not constitute a microemulsion, comprising

a) 0.5 - 6.5 wt.% oil or fat phase, comprising at least one liquid oil component at 20 °C, selected from

II. An opposition was filed against the grant of the patent. The grounds for opposition cited were lack of novelty and lack of inventive step (Article 100 a) EPC), insufficient disclosure (Article 100 b) EPC), and impermissible extension of content (Article 100 c) EPC). The ground for opposition under Article 100 b) EPC was withdrawn during the opposition proceedings.

III. The opposition division decided to revoke the patent. This decision was based on the granted patent as the main request and two auxiliary requests submitted on December 22, 2016.

In particular, the opposition division stated in its decision that claim 1 of the main request as well as of auxiliary requests 1-2 did not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. The skilled person could not have clearly and directly derived from the original documents that emulsifiers were not to be counted towards the oil or fat phase.

IV. The patent proprietor (appellant) filed an appeal against the above decision.

With the statement of grounds of appeal dated July 2, 2018, the appellant submitted two further auxiliary requests (auxiliary requests 3 and 4).

V. The following evidence relevant to the decision was submitted by the parties during the appeal proceedings:

a) Evidence submitted by the respondent (opponent) with the response to the appeal:

O20: Excerpt from the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary and Handbook, Volume 2, 9th edition, 2002, pages 1374 and 1377

O21: Excerpt from Wikipedia on Jojoba Alcohol, published on April 21, 2006

b) Evidence submitted by the respondent on February 2, 2021:

O23: Teaching document Lingolia, EINFACH BESSER IN SPRACHEN, German Grammar, Article (Determiner), 2017

VI. An oral hearing took place before the board on March 5, 2021.

VII. The appellant (patent proprietor) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent in the granted version (main request). Alternatively, it requested the maintenance of the patent based on one of the auxiliary requests 1 and 2 submitted with the letter of December 22, 2016 or the auxiliary requests 3 and 4 submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal dated July 2, 2018.

VIII. The respondent (opponent) requested the dismissal of the appeal and, alternatively, the referral of the matter back to the opposition division in case any of the requests met the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

IX. The relevant arguments of the appellant for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

The feature introduced in claim 1 of the main request, that ""the emulsifiers do not count towards the oil or fat phase by definition,"" was literally based on the text passage on page 7, lines 1-2 of the original application. This feature referred in the original application as well as in the present claim to the same subject matter, namely all possible emulsifiers. Therefore, the present claim 1 met the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

X. The relevant arguments of the respondent for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

The feature disclosed on original page 7, lines 1-2, that ""the emulsifiers do not count towards the oil or fat phase by definition,"" referred to emulsifiers in general. In the present claim 1, however, the corresponding introduced feature should be interpreted as referring exclusively to the emulsifiers defined under points e) and f) in the present claim 1. Other emulsifiers could therefore now count towards the oil or fat phase. Such compositions went beyond the originally disclosed content of the application, so that the amendment made constituted a violation of Article 123(2) EPC.

This interpretation of the feature in the present claim was justified for the following reasons:

a) According to German grammar, the use of the definite article ""the"" in the context of the claim required a reference back (see O23). Since only the emulsifiers defined under e) and f) were previously mentioned, linguistically the said feature could only refer to the emulsifiers defined under e) and f).

b) The interpretation of the feature in the context of the claim put forward by the appellant would not make sense. Several oil components defined under claim 1 a) i)-iii) also exhibited emulsifying properties (see O20-O21). Following the appellant's interpretation, such compounds would be excluded from the oil phase, which would not be logical.","Reasons for the Decision

Main Request - Granted Patent

1. Amendments

1.1 Claim 1 is based on original Claim 1, wherein:

(a) several features from the dependent original Claims 5, 13, 16, 20, 21, and 23 have been introduced, and

(b) the feature that ""the emulsifiers do not count towards the oil or fat phase by definition"" has been introduced verbatim from the original description (see page 7, lines 1-2).

1.2 The fulfillment of the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC has not been questioned for the amendments defined under (a).

1.3 Regarding feature (b), the parties agreed that this refers, in the context of the original description (see pages 6-7), to all possible emulsifiers contained in the composition.

1.4 In light of the wording of the present Claim 1, the Board is of the opinion that the said feature refers in the context of the claim to all emulsifiers and is not limited to the emulsifiers defined under points e) and f). The Board believes that the skilled person would interpret Claim 1 in this manner for the following reasons:

1.4.1 The use of the article ""the"" without further qualification (e.g., ""the aforementioned"" or ""the non-ionic"") would not lead the skilled person to interpret it as limited exclusively to the emulsifiers defined under points e) and f). Furthermore, in the present Claim 1, the mentioned non-ionic emulsifiers are listed alongside the oil or fat phase (namely as components a), e), and f)) and are each defined with specific corresponding proportions, which would lead the skilled person to consider these components as separate individual components even without the disputed feature. Consequently, the skilled person would recognize that the disputed feature is intended to have a broader meaning.

1.4.2 Should the skilled person still have doubts regarding the interpretation of the present claim, they would refer to the description, particularly the passage on page 5, line 19 of the contested patent, which corresponds to the passage on page 7, lines 1-2 of the original application. As noted in point 1.3, the parties agree that the said passage refers to all possible emulsifiers contained in the composition. Thus, the skilled person would find confirmation of the interpretation of the disputed feature in the present claim as referring to all emulsifiers.

1.5 The respondent argued that several oil components defined under Claim 1 a) i)-iii) also exhibit emulsifying properties (see O20-O21) and that it would therefore not be logical to exclude such compounds from the oil phase.

The Board notes that the fact presented by the respondent that certain compounds exhibit more than one property is a common and well-known matter in the field of cosmetic compositions. The Board therefore believes that the skilled person would understand the present Claim 1 to mean that only the lipophilic properties of the oil components defined under point a) are relevant in the context of the invention. The skilled person would not consider these oil components as emulsifiers in the context of the present patent. Consequently, the said feature refers to all possible emulsifiers except for the oil components defined under a). In other words, the components defined under a) i)-iii) do not, by definition, constitute emulsifiers. This interpretation is based on the entire content of the present patent and is consistent with the preferred compounds in the examples.

1.6 The respondent's argument regarding a grammatically correct interpretation of Claim 1 is ultimately unconvincing. The respondent argued based on O23 that the use of a definite article implies a reference back. This argument is not entirely accurate. As presented by the appellant, in the present case, the reference is not absolutely the same (""non-ionic emulsifiers"" versus ""the emulsifiers""). Furthermore, the Board notes that according to the established case law of the Boards of Appeal, the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC are to be assessed on the same basis as the other patentability criteria, namely from the perspective of a skilled person on a technical and factual basis without constructed or semantic interpretation (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 9th edition 2019, II.E.1.3.2). In the present case, the skilled person would arrive at a different interpretation for the technical reasons outlined above (see 1.4.1-1.5).

1.7 The Board is therefore of the opinion that the feature that ""the emulsifiers do not count towards the oil or fat phase by definition"" should be interpreted identically in the original application as well as in the present claim. The Board thus concludes that Claim 1 of the main request meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC and that the decision of the opposition division should be overturned.

Referral Back

2. Article 11 of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA 2020) in the version applicable from January 1, 2020 (Official Journal EPO 2019, A63), which applies here in accordance with Article 25 (1) RPBA 2020, states that a Board shall refer a matter back to the instance that issued the contested decision if there are special reasons for doing so.

3. In the present case, the grounds for opposition under Article 100 a) EPC were completely disregarded in the contested decision, and all relevant questions appear not to be decidable by the Board with appropriate effort. In particular, no arguments regarding the grounds for opposition under Article 100 a) EPC were presented by the respondent during the appeal proceedings. A referral back was also requested by the respondent. The appellant had no objections in this regard.

4. Consequently, the Board is convinced that there are special reasons within the meaning of Article 11, sentence 1 RPBA 2020 to refer the matter back to the examining division for further examination of the remaining grounds for opposition under Article 100 a) EPC in accordance with Article 111 (1) EPC.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided:, The contested decision is revoked., The matter is referred back to the opposition division for further decision.",patent revoked,patent revoked,decision under appeal is set aside,Beiersdorf AG,Beiersdorf AG Unnastrasse 48 20253 Hamburg / DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IV. In the opposition proceedings, the patent proprietor defended the patent in a limited form. The Opposition Division concluded in the contested decision that the claims of the main request before it did not contain unlawful amendments (Article 123(2) EPC). The claimed method was novel over D3 (in combination with D1) and D5 (Article 54 EPC). Inventive step was given starting from D1, D2, D3, or D5 as the closest prior art.

V. In their statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the appellants essentially argued that the claimed method was not novel over D3 and D5. Likewise, there was no inventive step starting from D1, D2, or D5. Furthermore, the reasoning of the Opposition Division regarding the issue of unlawful amendments was not convincing.

VI. In response to the statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the respondent essentially argued that the novelty objections were unfounded, as none of the cited documents disclosed all the features of the claimed method. The claimed method was neither suggested starting from D1, nor from D2 or D5. The submissions of the appellants regarding unlawful amendments were unsubstantiated and should therefore be disregarded.

VII. By communication dated September 17, 2020, the parties were informed of the preliminary opinion of the Board (Article 15(1) RPBA 2020).

VIII. All parties had requested oral proceedings as an auxiliary measure. Due to the general situation regarding the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic, the appellants requested that the proceedings be conducted as a video conference, while the respondent requested an in-person hearing. The hearing therefore took place on December 10, 2020, at the direction of the Board in such a way that both the respondent and the Board were physically present in the hearing room, while the appellants were connected via video link.

At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.

IX. The requests of the parties confirmed at the end of the oral proceedings were:

The appellants (Opponents 1 and 2) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

The respondent (patent proprietor) requested the dismissal of the appeals (main request) or, alternatively, the maintenance of the patent based on one of the auxiliary requests 1 and 2, both submitted with the response dated October 26, 2018, to the statements of grounds of appeal.

X. Claim 1 of the present main request has the following wording; the designation of the claim features with letters serves for better clarity and is taken from the contested decision:

a) A method for producing carboxylic acid esters by reacting a carboxylic acid or a carboxylic anhydride or a mixture thereof

b) with an alcohol in the presence of an esterification catalyst selected from alkoxides, carboxylates, and chelate compounds of titanium, zirconium, tin, aluminum, and zinc,

c) in a reaction system consisting of one or more reactors,

d) wherein reaction water is distilled off as an alcohol-water azeotrope with the overhead,

e) the overhead is at least partially condensed,

f) the condensate is separated into an aqueous phase and an organic phase, and

g) the organic phase is at least partially returned to the reaction system,

characterized in that

h) components having a boiling point lower than that of the alcohol are at least partially removed from the returning organic phase,

i) wherein at least a portion of the organic phase is treated by evaporating and/or distilling off components having a boiling point lower than that of the alcohol, and the thus treated organic phase is at least partially returned to the reaction system, and

j) the components having a boiling point lower than that of the alcohol include olefins derived from the alcohol used through dehydration.

Claim 1 of the first auxiliary request differs from this in that feature e) is amended to ""the overhead is condensed.""

Claim 1 of the second auxiliary request differs from claim 1 of the main request in that in the method step i) the manner of removing the light boiling components has been further specified. The feature ""wherein at least a portion of the organic phase is expanded into a relaxation vessel, wherein components having a boiling point lower than that of the alcohol are at least partially evaporated, and the un-evaporated liquid phase is at least partially returned to the reaction system"" has been added.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Right to be heard (Article 113 EPC)

The oral proceedings were conducted in the form requested by the respective party. The appellants were connected via video link, while the respondent was able to present their arguments to the board in the courtroom.

3. Unallowable amendments (Article 123(2) EPC), novelty (Article 54 EPC)

The board has come to the conclusion that the processes defined in the main claims of the present applications are derivable in an obvious manner from the prior art starting from D2 (Article 56 EPC, see below).

The objections raised under Article 123(2) EPC as well as the novelty objections (Article 54 EPC) against D3 and D5 can therefore be disregarded.

Main Request

4. Inventive step (Article 56 EPC)

4.1 A catalytic process for the esterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols is claimed. In this process, the resulting reaction water is azeotropically distilled off with the alcohol, and the alcohol is returned to the reaction after phase separation. The claimed invention is based on the insight that the alcohols used partially release water under the prevailing reaction conditions, and the resulting olefins, which are then azeotropically distilled off together with the water-alcohol mixture and returned to the reaction system with the alcohol, lead to a discoloration of the esters produced over time. These olefins must therefore be removed in a suitable manner, see paragraphs [0007] and [0008] of the description.

4.2 The contested decision addressed inventive step starting from D1, D2, D3, and D5.

The contested patent deals with the problem of removing olefins formed as by-products from the alcohols during esterification.

A document that represents the closest prior art should therefore also address this problem; this problem is not new but has been known for a long time. The board therefore considers D2 to be the closest prior art, as neither D3 nor D5 mention the separation of by-products, and D1 contains only a sentence referring to D2. During the oral proceedings, inventive step was discussed exclusively based on D2 with the consent of the parties.

4.3 D2 discloses a process for the esterification of carboxylic acids with an excess of alcohol. It was noted that mainly low-boiling olefins and aldehydes are responsible for discoloration of the esters, as described on page 2 of D2. In particular, in continuous processes, these substances are problematic as they accumulate due to the constant return of the alcohol (see second paragraph on page 2). As a measure to remove these products, it is proposed to fractionate the distilled alcohol before returning it, discarding a certain portion of the distillate that contains these products (see patent claim or the paragraph spanning pages 1 and 2).

4.4 The claimed process differs from the process disclosed in D2 in several respects, namely in features (b), (e), and (f).

According to the appellants, features (e) and (f) are implicitly disclosed in D2. However, since these features do not contribute to an inventive step, even if they are not explicitly disclosed in D2 (see below), this is irrelevant.

The claimed process uses catalysts (feature (b)); D2 advises against the use of catalysts (last paragraph on page 2).

In the claimed process, the distillate is condensed and separated into an organic and an aqueous phase before the low-boilers are removed from the alcohol phase (features (e) and (f)).

4.5 The patent subjectively sets out to minimize the amount of alcohol that is inevitably removed along with the olefins (see paragraph [0009] of the description).

However, it was not argued that the claimed process achieves an improvement in this regard compared to D2 that would stem from the distinguishing features.

The objective technical problem starting from D2 was therefore to provide an alternative process for the esterification of carboxylic acids.

4.6 It must be decided whether the claimed solution, namely the introduction of features (b), (e), and (f) into the process known from D2, was obvious to the skilled person as a solution to the technical problem.

4.6.1 Feature (b)

At the priority date, it was known that the so-called BASF process (as described in D1 or D2) can be carried out either autocatally or with amphoteric catalysts, such as titanates. This is described in D3, see page 514, second column, last complete paragraph; the catalysts are mentioned on the same page in the first column. The first-mentioned passage contains a reference to D1, and D1 refers back to D2 regarding the removal of low-boilers. D3 is an excerpt from a standard work on industrial chemistry and was therefore known to the skilled person. The use of the catalysts mentioned in feature (b) was therefore an obvious alternative for the skilled person.

It is also not contrary to this that, as emphasized by the respondent, D2 itself advises against the use of catalysts. The encyclopedic reference in D3 would dispel such concerns of the skilled person. There was no prejudice against the use of catalysts in the BASF process.

4.6.2 Features (e) and (f)

These features require that the distillate is at least partially condensed and the condensate is subsequently separated into an aqueous and an organic phase. The disclosure in D2 at this point in the process is not particularly detailed; it merely states that the distilled components, which mainly consist of alcohol, are fractionated, discarding a certain part as a distillate that contains these products.

However, the board believes that a skilled person would sensibly perform a phase separation before distilling the alcohol. This is necessary to avoid returning the water formed in the reaction and carried out with the alcohol back into the reaction. Furthermore, D2 always refers to an alcohol fraction in the distillate to be discarded (see, for example, page 2, line 2, or the second complete paragraph on page 2). If the water were not separated before fractionation, this distillate would be a mixed fraction, as the water/alcohol azeotrope would first be distilled off. Moreover, D2 describes an improvement of a process that is otherwise carried out ""as usual"" (last paragraph on the second page of the description). A usual procedure is shown, for example, in the encyclopedic article in D3 (Figure 3); there, too, a phase separation and removal of water occurs before the alcohol is returned to the reaction vessel.

The process features (e) and (f) therefore do not go beyond a skilled implementation of the process described in D2.

4.7 The technical problem of finding an alternative process for esterification starting from D2 was therefore solved in an obvious manner.

4.8 The arguments of the respondent do not convince the board.

4.8.1 The respondent has argued as a central point that the process described in D2 should be understood differently than the board and the appellants have done.

In their view, D2 does not fractionate the returned alcohol used for removing the water in a continuous process after a phase separation. Instead, the fractionation of the alcohol defined at the end of claim 1 of D2 refers to the excess alcohol remaining in the reaction vessel at the end of a discontinuous process, which is distilled off from the crude ester and cleaned of the by-products formed before being returned to the reaction vessel for possible reuse. They justify this by stating that D2 only refers to the ""distilled components, which mainly consist of alcohol"" (claim 1 and last paragraph of the first page of the description). If this return were to refer to a continuous process, it would have to refer to an alcohol-water mixture that would be fractionated after phase separation.

Based on this understanding of D2, additional differences and advantages of the claimed process compared to D2 would arise that are not suggested by the prior art.

4.8.2 The board does not follow this interpretation of D2.

As argued by the appellants, D2 states at the point where the invention is explained (first complete paragraph on the second page of the description) that the olefins formed do not disturb in a discontinuous operation, but do so in a continuous one, as they accumulate in the process due to the constant return of the alcohol. There is therefore no reason to assume that the proposed improvement in D2 by separating the olefins from the returning alcohol would relate to a discontinuous process in which the olefins formed as by-products are separated at the end of the reaction. Furthermore, the embodiment in D2 ultimately describes a continuous process in which low-boilers are continuously (""per hour"") removed from the returning alcohol.

D2 therefore describes, apart from the differences in features (b), (e), and (f) discussed above, a process corresponding to the present claim 1.

4.9 Claim 1 of the main request therefore lacks inventive step over D2.

Auxiliary Requests

5. The first auxiliary request suffers from the same lack of inventive step as the main request. The respondent has conceded that the amendment in feature (e) of claim 1 has no impact on the assessment of inventive step starting from D2.

6. Claim 1 of the second auxiliary request requires that in process step (i) the organic phase is relaxed in a relaxation vessel for the removal of the olefins, whereby the low-boilers evaporate and the liquid phase is returned.

6.1 The respondent has argued that the removal of the low-boilers by relaxing the liquid organic phase is not mentioned in any of the cited documents; furthermore, such relaxation is advantageous as it is technically easier to implement. The claimed process therefore relies on inventive step.

6.2 The appellants, on the other hand, argued that a skilled person is aware that low-boiling components can alternatively be removed from a mixture by distillation or evaporation. The board agrees with this. A skilled person is also aware of the pros and cons of both methods and can therefore employ them as appropriate.

6.3 Claim 1 of both auxiliary requests therefore also lacks inventive step.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided:, The contested decision is annulled., The patent is revoked.",patent revoked,patent revoked,patent revoked,"OQ Chemicals GmbH, Evonik Operations GmbH",OQ Chemicals GmbH Rheinpromenade 4a 40798 Monheim am Rhein / DE,Michalski Hüttermann & Partner Patentanwälte mbB Kaistraße 16A 40221 Düsseldorf / DE,Evonik Operations GmbH Rellinghauserstrasse 1-11 45128 Essen / DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. European Patent No. 2 822 537 was granted with 15 claims. The independent claims of the patent read as follows:

""1. Combination therapeutic agent in the form of a pharmaceutical composition for use in the topical nasal treatment of rhinitis for the purpose of reducing the systemic absorption of imidazoline-based alpha-sympathomimetics, wherein the pharmaceutical composition comprises, in combination and each in pharmaceutically effective amounts

(a)

(a1) Pantothenol (Dexpanthenol) or its physiologically acceptable esters and/or

(a2) Pantothenic acid or its physiologically acceptable salts;

II. Four opponents filed opposition against the grant of the patent. The grounds for opposition cited were lack of novelty and lack of inventive step (Article 100(a) EPC), insufficient disclosure (Article 100(b) EPC), and impermissible extension of content (Article 100(c) EPC).

III. The Opposition Division decided to revoke the patent. This decision was based on the granted patent as the main request, the auxiliary requests I-X submitted on February 22, 2017, and the auxiliary requests IIA and IIB submitted during the oral proceedings on February 1, 2018, and February 2, 2018.

V. In the contested decision, the Opposition Division reached the following conclusions:

a) The documents submitted with the opposition were deemed to have been validly submitted in the proceedings. Document D48 was admitted into the proceedings.

b) The main request met the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC and did not fall under the prohibition of patentability according to Article 52(2)(a) EPC. However, the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request was not novel over D13. The purpose ""for the purpose of reducing the systemic absorption of imidazoline-based alpha-sympathomimetics"" would not represent a new application.

c) The subject matter of auxiliary requests I and II was not novel over D13 or D15/D24 and D26.

d) The auxiliary request IIA submitted during the oral proceedings was to be admitted into the proceedings. Depending on the interpretation of the introduced feature, claim 1 either did not meet the requirements of Article 83 EPC or Article 54 EPC with respect to D26 and D15/D24.

e) The auxiliary request IIB submitted during the oral proceedings was not to be admitted into the proceedings.

f) The subject matter of auxiliary requests III to VI was not novel over D15/D24.

g) Auxiliary requests VII to X contained the same unclear feature as auxiliary request IIA, which could be interpreted differently. Thus, auxiliary requests VII to X also did not meet the requirements of either Article 83 EPC or Article 54 EPC with respect to D26 and D15/D24.

VI. The patent proprietor (appellant) filed an appeal against the above decision. With their statement of grounds of appeal, they submitted 12 auxiliary requests corresponding to the auxiliary requests I-II, IIA, IIB, and III-X submitted in the first instance proceedings.

VII. The content of the claims on which the present decision is based is as follows:

Claim 1 of auxiliary request I is based on claim 1 of the main request, wherein:

- the component (a) has been limited to Pantothenol (Dexpanthenol) or its physiologically acceptable esters (i.e., the feature ""and/or (a2) Pantothenic acid or its physiologically acceptable salts"" has been deleted),

- the feature ""wherein component (a) is incorporated in the pharmaceutical composition, wherein the composition contains component (a) in an amount of 0.01 to 10 wt-%"" has been introduced after the definition of component (a), and

- the features ""wherein the imidazoline-based alpha-sympathomimetic is xylometazoline"" and ""wherein component (b) is incorporated in the pharmaceutical composition, wherein the composition contains component (b) in an amount of 0.001 to 2 wt-%"" have been introduced after the definition of component (b).

Claim 1 of auxiliary request II is based on claim 1 of auxiliary request I, wherein the feature ""wherein component (a) is used together and/or in combination with component (b) in the pharmaceutical composition with a pH in the range of 5.0 to 6.0 and/or is prepared for administration"" has been introduced at the end of the claim.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request IIA is based on claim 1 of auxiliary request II, wherein the feature ""wherein a vasoconstrictive effect is not extended to the cardiovascular system and side effects selected from hypertension, tachycardia, and reduced blood flow to peripheral body parts are avoided"" has been introduced after the purpose (i.e., after ""for the purpose of reducing the systemic absorption of imidazoline-based alpha-sympathomimetics"").

Claim 1 of auxiliary request IIB is identical to claim 15 of the main request.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request III is based on claim 1 of auxiliary request II, wherein the feature ""wherein at least one chemical buffering system is used to adjust and/or maintain the pH of the pharmaceutical composition, wherein a dihydrogen phosphate/monohydrogen phosphate buffer system is used as the chemical buffering system"" has been introduced at the end of the claim.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request IV is based on claim 1 of auxiliary request III, wherein the feature ""and wherein all active and/or inactive ingredients are incorporated in the pharmaceutical composition, wherein the composition has a content of degradation product(s) of component (b) of at most 2 wt%, based on the active ingredient (b), and a content of degradation product(s) of component (a) of at most 2 wt%, based on the active ingredient (a)"" has been introduced at the end of the claim.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request V is based on claim 1 of auxiliary request IV, wherein the feature ""and even after storage at temperatures in the range of 20 °C to 50 °C, at a pressure of 1,013.25 mbar and at a relative humidity in the range of 50% to 90% for at least 6 months"" has been introduced at the end of the claim.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request VI is based on claim 1 of auxiliary request V, wherein the degradation product(s) of component (b) are specified as ""namely impurity A"" and the degradation product(s) of component (a) as ""namely aminopropanol and/or D-pantolactone.""

Claims 1 of auxiliary requests VII and VIII combine the changes made in claims 1 of auxiliary requests IIA and VI.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request IX is based on claim 1 of auxiliary request VIII, wherein the feature ""wherein component (a) is used together and/or in combination with component (b) in a weight ratio of component (a) to component (b) in the range of 45:1 to 125:1"" has been introduced.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request X is based on claim 1 of auxiliary request IX, wherein the feature ""wherein the dihydrogen phosphate/monohydrogen phosphate buffer system is used with a dihydrogen phosphate/monohydrogen phosphate molar ratio in the range of 5:1 to 110:1"" has been introduced.

VIII. The following evidence relevant for the decision was submitted by the appellant with the letter dated August 22, 2019:

D87: PRAC Guidelines on Xylometazoline

IX. Following the request of opponent 4, the oral proceedings scheduled for July 21, 2021, were postponed to November 23, 2021.

In letters dated August 6, 2020, and August 24, 2020, and September 23, 2021, the appellant and opponent 1 announced their intention to participate in the oral proceedings with three to five and three to four persons, respectively.

In a communication dated November 11, 2021, the Board informed the parties, referring to the internet communication of the Boards of Appeal dated September 22, 2021, that due to the coronavirus pandemic and the associated hygiene measures, participation in the oral proceedings would be limited to two persons per party and that the use of face masks in the hearing room would be required throughout the duration of the proceedings.

In their respective letters dated November 11, 2021, opponent 4 requested that the oral proceedings be conducted as a videoconference, and opponent 1 agreed to this. In a letter dated November 10, 2021, the appellant requested, in response to the communication from the Board dated November 11, 2021, among other things, the postponement of the oral proceedings and, alternatively, if the date of the proceedings was maintained, the conduct of the oral proceedings as a videoconference.

In a communication dated November 16, 2021, the Board informed the parties that the date for the oral proceedings would be maintained and that they would take place as a videoconference.

X. On November 23, 2021, the oral proceedings before the Board took place as a videoconference. This occurred in the absence of opponent 3, who had informed the Board in advance.

XI. The appellant (patent proprietor) requested the annulment of the contested decision, i.e., the maintenance of the patent in the granted form (main request) and, alternatively, the maintenance of the patent based on one of the auxiliary requests I, II, IIA, IIB, and III-X submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal dated July 31, 2018.

Furthermore, the appellant requested:

- the postponement of the oral proceedings to a later date in order to hold them as a ""live hearing,""

- the reimbursement of the appeal fee and, if necessary, the referral of the present matter back to the Opposition Division due to substantial procedural errors in the opposition proceedings,

- not to admit document D48 into the appeal proceedings, and

- to admit document D87 into the appeal proceedings.

XII. The opponents (opponents 1-4) requested the dismissal of the appeal.

Furthermore, opponent 1 requested that auxiliary request IIB and document D87 not be admitted into the appeal proceedings.

Opponent 2 requested, alternatively, that the proceedings not be referred back to the first instance.

Opponent 3 requested in writing the referral of the present matter back to the Opposition Division in the event that the Board would consider the subject matter of the contested patent as novel.

XIII. The appellant and opponents 1 and 4 further requested that a certain number of documents or arguments not be admitted into the proceedings. Since these proved to be irrelevant for the present decision, the corresponding requests are not further considered in this decision.

XIV. The relevant arguments of the appellant can be summarized as follows:

a) Conducting the oral proceedings as a videoconference cannot ensure a fair trial for the appellant in the present case, as there is a risk of exchange between the opponents during the discussions. The present case differs from the case underlying decision G 1/21, so the latter is not applicable. In particular, in the present case, all parties are from the domestic area, and a postponement would be foreseeable for a limited time, as the COVID-19 infection has proven to be seasonal. Therefore, the request for postponement of the oral proceedings should be granted.

b) The Opposition Division committed substantial procedural errors that would unduly disadvantage the appellant, namely:

- the change in the composition of the Opposition Division shortly before the oral proceedings,

- the lack of explanation by the Opposition Division during the oral proceedings as to why it did not consider the feature of reducing systemic absorption as novel, and

- the failure to consider independent claim 15 of the contested patent during the novelty discussion or the non-admission of auxiliary request IIB in the opposition proceedings.

c) D48 is a party expert opinion that should have been submitted earlier. In particular, the late submission of this document in the opposition proceedings deprived the appellant of the opportunity to prepare a counter-expert opinion. D48 should therefore be excluded from the appeal proceedings. D87 should be admitted into the appeal proceedings because it is prima facie highly relevant and directly applicable to proving patentability.

d) The main request meets the requirements of Article 54 EPC. The claimed effect of reducing the systemic absorption of the alpha-sympathomimetic and the associated reduction of systemic side effects leads to a new application. The benefit-risk assessment and thus the treatment with the claimed combination therapeutic agent could indeed be conducted differently with knowledge of the claimed effect (duration of therapy, administered amount, ...). Furthermore, risk patients who were previously excluded from treatment due to systemic side effects can now be treated.

e) Auxiliary requests I, II, and III to VI meet the requirements of Article 54 EPC. Additional features have been introduced in claims 1 of these auxiliary requests that bring the claimed subject matter closer to the embodiments. The combination of features in these claims is not disclosed in the prior art.

f) The feature introduced in claims 1 of auxiliary requests IIA and VI to X does not concern an absolute avoidance of the extension of the vasoconstrictive effect to the cardiovascular system and side effects, but merely a reduction of these. This interpretation is supported by the description of the contested patent. This purpose is thus consistent with the already claimed reduction of systemic absorption of the alpha-sympathomimetic. The requirements of Article 84 EPC are therefore met.

g) The auxiliary request IIB submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal contains only independent claim 15 of the contested patent and should therefore be admitted into the appeal proceedings. Furthermore, auxiliary request IIB meets the requirements of Article 54 EPC. In the claim of auxiliary request IIB, the purpose is specifically attributed to pantothenol and/or pantothenic acid, which cannot be derived from the prior art.

XV. The relevant arguments of the opponents can be summarized as follows:

a) In light of the epidemic situation related to the COVID-19 infection, conducting the oral proceedings as a videoconference is appropriate. Due to high incidence rates and hospital admissions, the situation regarding the pandemic is at least as serious as in the case underlying G 1/21. G 1/21 is fully applicable. Furthermore, conducting the oral proceedings as a videoconference does not disadvantage the appellant, as there is no exchange between the opponents. The theoretical possibility of such an exchange exists in both an in-person hearing and a videoconference. The timeframe for a postponement cannot be determined with certainty, as knowledge regarding a possible seasonal character of the COVID-19 infection is still too limited. The request for postponement of the oral proceedings should be denied.

b) The facts mentioned by the appellant do not constitute substantial procedural errors.

c) D48 is part of the appeal proceedings. D87 has been re-published and is therefore not relevant to the question of novelty. Furthermore, this document is not suitable to clarify the relevant questions regarding novelty. Therefore, D87 should not be admitted into the proceedings.

d) The subject matter of claim 1 of the main request is not novel over the use of the claimed combination therapeutic agent described in the prior art, particularly D13. The reduction of systemic absorption of the alpha-sympathomimetic does not lead to a new clinical situation.

e) Auxiliary requests I, II, and III to VI do not meet the requirements of Article 54 EPC. The additional features introduced in these auxiliary requests and their combination are already disclosed in D15/D24.

f) The feature introduced in auxiliary requests IIA and VII to X results in a clarity deficiency. It is unclear whether the claimed non-extension or avoidance is to be considered absolute or partial.

g) The Opposition Division correctly exercised its discretion not to admit auxiliary request IIB into the proceedings. This auxiliary request does not address any objections and gives rise to new objections. This auxiliary request should not be admitted into the appeal proceedings. Furthermore, the claim of auxiliary request IIB does not substantially differ from claim 1 of the main request and does not define a new application. Therefore, auxiliary request IIB does not meet the requirements of Article 54 EPC.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Request for Postponement of the Oral Hearing

The appellant requests that the oral hearing be postponed to a later date when the epidemic situation has eased, and alternatively, in the event that the hearing date is maintained, that the oral hearing be conducted as a video conference.

The appellant justifies the request for postponement by stating that the oral hearing should take place as an in-person hearing (""in-person hearing""), as a hearing conducted via video conference does not guarantee a fair trial. Furthermore, a postponement does not have to be indefinite.

In its decision G 1/21, the Enlarged Board of Appeal decided that oral hearings can also be held via video conference under certain circumstances, even if not all parties agree. This is permitted when a general state of emergency exists that impairs the ability of the parties to participate in an in-person hearing (see decision formula, as well as reasons 48-51).

It is undisputed that since March 2020, a general state of emergency due to the Covid-19 pandemic has been ongoing, which continued even in November 2021. In the case of an in-person hearing, numerous participants from various parts of Germany would have to travel and would be exposed to an increased risk of infection both during travel and at the hearing itself. In this context, it should also be noted that the appellant vehemently rejected the precautionary measures announced by the Board for the initially planned in-person hearing, which included a restriction on the number of participants and the wearing of masks (see submission dated November 10, 2021). Against this background, conducting the oral hearing as an in-person hearing on November 23, 2021, did not seem appropriate.

It was also undisputed among the parties that a postponement should only occur at a time when the epidemic situation has eased—regarding this, the appellant argued that the COVID-19 situation is seasonal and therefore a postponement would be time-limited.

The Board shares the view of the respondents that the timeframe for a postponement cannot be determined with certainty, as it is unclear how the pandemic will develop further. A postponement is thus not time-bound. Furthermore, it should be considered that the hearing has already been postponed once. The fact that the reason for this was not the pandemic but the prevention of a party is irrelevant to the consideration of whether the hearing should be postponed again, as what matters is that the proceedings are further extended. This, however, contradicts the legitimate interest of the parties and the public in a prompt conclusion of the proceedings.

The Board also does not share the appellant's concern that the format of the hearing would be to their disadvantage and favor the respondents. This is justified by the possibility that the respondents could exchange information during breaks in the hearing as well as during the hearing itself via video link or chat. The Board agrees with the respondents' argument that parties can also exchange information during an in-person hearing via chat during the debate or in person during breaks if they wish. The format of the hearing is irrelevant in this regard. Furthermore, the respondents have assured that they will not engage in any exchanges, making the appellant's argument rather speculative.

The appellant further stated that a difference from the case underlying G 1/21 is that all parties would have to travel from Germany and not from abroad, and that there is no general lockdown. The Board does not consider this to be significant differences in the present case. The respondents expressed during the oral hearing that they reject an in-person hearing at the current time due to the partly long travel distances and the large number of participants. The Board considers the rejection of an in-person hearing at the current time to be justified and believes that the ability of the respondents to participate in the in-person hearing is impaired in the present case.

For the reasons stated above, the Board considers the conditions set out in G 1/21 for conducting an oral hearing via video conference to be met. In particular, it sees no reason why this form of hearing does not represent a suitable alternative to an in-person hearing in the present case. The request for postponement of the oral hearing is therefore denied.

2. Alleged Substantial Procedural Defects

2.1 The appellant requests the reimbursement of the appeal fee due to alleged substantial procedural errors in the first-instance proceedings. The appellant claims to have been unduly disadvantaged, resulting in violations of the legal principle of the right to be heard.

2.2 Regarding the change in the composition of the opposition division shortly before the oral hearing, the Board notes that the opposition proceedings were conducted in writing until the oral hearing. The new chairperson thus had the opportunity to familiarize herself with all submissions presented by the parties prior to her appointment. The composition was not changed thereafter. Therefore, the change in composition before the oral hearing does not constitute a violation of the legal principle of the right to be heard.

2.3 According to the minutes of the oral hearing (see page 3), the appellant asked for a justification after the announcement of the opposition division's opinion on the novelty of the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request. In response to this question, the opposition division stated that ""the feature of reduced absorption would not establish novelty over the prior art."" As can be seen from the minutes of the oral hearing (see pages 2-3), this feature was the central topic of discussion, so this decision cannot have been surprising. The written decision of the opposition division also contains a detailed justification regarding the decision on the novelty of the main request. This is based solely on facts, evidence, and arguments discussed in the opposition proceedings. The Board finally notes that a party does not have a right to a detailed explanation of the reasons for the decision during the oral hearing. The Board therefore sees no reason to conclude that there was a violation of the legal principle of the right to be heard in this regard.

2.4 According to the appellant, they were deprived of the opportunity to comment on the subject matter of independent claim 15 of the main request because this claim was disregarded during the novelty discussion regarding the main request, and auxiliary request IIB, which was restricted to the said claim, was not admitted in the opposition proceedings.

While the scope of the opposition is defined according to Rules 76(2)(c) and 81(1) EPC, Article 101(2) EPC states that the existence of an opposition ground is sufficient to revoke a patent. According to established case law, it is also common practice to assess a request only as a whole. Since the opposition division concluded that the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request was not novel, there was no reason to discuss the further claims, whether dependent or independent. Furthermore, the opposition division exercised its discretion not to admit auxiliary request IIB into the proceedings based on the correct criterion, namely the apparent failure to overcome the existing objection. The Board therefore believes that there was also no violation of the legal principle of the right to be heard in this case.

2.5 The Board thus concludes that there is no substantial procedural defect. The request for reimbursement of the appeal fee is therefore denied (Rule 103(1)(a) EPC).

3. Admission of Evidence

3.1 The document D48 submitted by respondent 1 in the opposition proceedings after the opposition period was submitted during the period according to Rule 116(1) EPC. The admission of document D48 was specifically discussed in the opposition proceedings. Applying the criterion of apparent relevance, document D48 was admitted into the opposition proceedings. The Board notes that the opposition division exercised its discretion using the correct criterion. There is also no indication that this exercise was carried out in an unreasonable manner. In particular, document D48 relates to the issue of the existence of a new patient group or a new clinical situation and is therefore prima facie relevant to the question of novelty. The Board finally notes that the actual persuasive power of the opinion is not decisive for the admission question in the present case. Document D48 is therefore part of the appeal proceedings.

3.2 Document D87 was submitted after the statement of appeal but before the summons to the oral hearing. The admission of this document is therefore to be assessed according to Article 13(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA) 2020.

This document was submitted by the appellant to support their argument regarding a previous exclusion of risk patients from treatment with imidazoline-based alpha-sympathomimetics. Document D87 reveals the updated warning regarding the side effects associated with xylometazoline, particularly for cardiovascular risk patients. Document D87 thus relates to the core issue regarding novelty.

According to the appellant, this document is intended to demonstrate that the claimed reduction in absorption had not been recognized in the prior art up to the priority date. The subsequent publication of the document therefore does not pose an obstacle to its admission in the present case.

Finally, the Board notes that the recommendation expressed in D87 was only adopted on October 31, 2018, so that submission of this document with the statement of appeal on July 31, 2018, was not possible. Its submission on August 22, 2019, therefore does not violate the principle of procedural economy.

Document D87 is thus admitted into the appeal proceedings (Article 13(1) RPBA 2020).

Main Request - Granted Patent

4. Novelty

4.1 Document D13 discloses the use of xylometazoline (i.e., an imidazoline-based alpha-sympathomimetic) together with dexpanthenol for the intranasal treatment of rhinitis (see D13, points 1, 2, and 4.1). The present claim 1 thus concerns the same active ingredient combination for use in the treatment of the same disease via the same administration route as described in document D13. This was not disputed.

4.2 Article 54(5) EPC provides for the patentability of known active ingredient combinations for ""specific use"" if that use does not belong to the prior art. According to G 2/08, a new specific use can exist not only in the form of a new disease but also in the following forms:

a) a new method of administration (route of administration, dosage, dosage instructions, ...)

b) a new patient group or

c) a different effect leading to a truly new application, as defined in T 1020/03.

4.3 In the present case, none of the aforementioned situations applies.

a) It is undisputed that the method of administration is the same as in the use according to document D13.

b) Contrary to the appellant's opinion, the claimed effect of reduced absorption does not necessarily define a new patient group.

While the Board agrees with the appellant that a reduction in absorption should ultimately lead to a reduction in the side effects associated with the systemic absorption of alpha-sympathomimetics, no correlation has been demonstrated between the degree of reduction in absorption and the degree of reduction in the aforementioned clinical side effects. The reduction in absorption in example 3 is indeed small (4 to 17% reduction in Cmax and 8 to 33% reduction in AUC). The appellant argued that a 17% or 33% reduction is significant, making a reduction in systemic side effects credible. The Board notes that these values were not achieved universally and generally, but rather represent the maximum values reached under certain conditions. Furthermore, there is no indication that the degree of absorption reductions is directly transferable to that of the reduction in systemic side effects. In the absence of a specific relationship demonstrated by experimental data or prior art documents between both reductions, it cannot be concluded that a therapeutically relevant reduction in side effects occurs with the claimed combination. The appellant's argument that the necessary tests were ethically unfeasible is unconvincing. Clinical trials are typically conducted during the drug development process and can be adapted to meet the requirements of an ethics committee. Furthermore, it was not demonstrated whether the potentially achieved reduction in systemic side effects is sufficient to treat cardiovascular risk patients, who may have previously been excluded from treatment based on a benefit-risk assessment, now without risk. In this context, it is noted that the patent in dispute does not identify such a patient group and that the claims are not restricted to a specific patient group. On the contrary, the treatment of all patients is considered and claimed. At the same time, cardiovascular risk patients are not absolutely excluded from treatment in document D13, as there is merely a warning. This warning necessitates a benefit-risk assessment in certain cases. However, a clearly defined patient group is not excluded by this. Also, the document D87 cited by the appellant contains only a warning and no exclusion of a specific patient group. Even if individual additional patients could now be treated, there would at least be an overlap of the patient groups treated in the prior art and according to the present claims. Such an overlap would not confer novelty.

c) The newly claimed effect does not lead to a truly new application either.

The appellant argued that the target measure of systemic absorption was not disclosed in the prior art, so that novelty should be recognized based on this new effect. However, the realization of a reduction in absorption alone is not sufficient to justify a new clinical application. As already explained in 4.3 b), it has not been demonstrated that the identified reduction in absorption necessarily leads to a clinically observable and therapeutically relevant reduction in side effects. Even if this were demonstrated, it would still be questionable whether a new therapeutic application would actually arise. The occurrence of systemic side effects due to the low systemic absorption of xylometazoline was already known and therefore to be avoided (see D13 point 5.2 but also e.g., D3). Consequently, the Board believes that a practicing physician would not have changed the nature of their treatment upon learning of the effect claimed in the patent in dispute. In particular, since the expert was aware of the need for a benefit-risk assessment when treating cardiovascular risk patients with Nasic® (see D13, point 4.4), they would have observed the occurrence of systemic side effects in such patients. The warning issued in document D13 actually concerns the combination preparation, even if it was issued due to the side effects of xylometazoline. Therefore, the expert could have already determined the non-occurrence or low occurrence of such side effects using the combinations described in the prior art without knowledge of the patent in dispute. The Board therefore cannot share the appellant's view that the present case differs from the case in T 254/93 because in the present case the claimed indication was not visually recognizable in the prior art, as the side effects are systemic rather than topical and are also very complex. The Board particularly notes that the patent in dispute names hypertension, tachycardia, or reduced blood flow to peripheral body parts as systemic side effects (see e.g., paragraph [0031]). These are all easily monitored and recognized by the expert. The argument presented by the appellant during the oral hearing that knowledge of the effect described in the patent in dispute would lead to a shift in the benefit-risk assessment (e.g., a higher tendency to treat risk patients, as well as longer treatment time or higher dosage) is ultimately unconvincing. Such a shift has not been demonstrated for the reasons given above, and the resulting not clearly defined overlap of applications could not define a truly new application.

4.4 The appellant further argued that the therapy of side effects actually represents an independent therapeutic application and cited the administration of probiotics during antibiotic treatment as an example. The appellant stated that the aim of the present claim 1 is not the treatment of rhinitis as such but the direct therapy of systemic side effects. The Board does not see how this argument should be applicable in the present case, as in the present case there is no therapy of side effects with a new active ingredient but merely their alleged reduction using the known active ingredient combination. Furthermore, the Board notes that the therapy of side effects is not claimed. It was also not experimentally demonstrated that a reduction in systemic absorption necessarily leads to a treatment of side effects.

4.5 The appellant's arguments regarding the effect of pantothenol as a penetration enhancer (see D70-D78 and D44-D47) are unconvincing, as this effect has not been described in connection with an imidazoline-based alpha-sympathomimetic. Contrary to the appellant's opinion, the above documents do not show an abstract principle of the fundamental action of pantothenol.

4.6 Regarding the previous decisions of the Boards of Appeal cited by all parties, the Board notes the following:

In decisions T 290/86, T 836/01, T 1955/09, T 19/86, and T 893/90, the presence of a new application was recognized either based on

- a clearly identifiable new target or therapeutic effect (T 290/86, T 836/01, T 1955/09) or

- a new patient group that is clearly distinguishable from the prior art and defined in the claims (see T 19/86, T 893/90).

For the reasons stated above, the present case does not correspond to these cases.

In contrast, in decisions T 233/96, T 486/01, and T 254/93, a new application was denied because either no new patient group or no new therapeutic use could be clearly identified compared to the known applications. In particular, the case T 254/93 does not fundamentally differ from the present case, as in both cases the claimed effect and the known therapeutic use appear inextricably linked, and the expert could have been aware of the claimed effect.

4.7 The Board thus concludes that claim 1 of the main request does not define a new specific application compared to the use disclosed in document D13. The subject matter of claim 1 of the main request is therefore not novel compared to document D13 (Article 100(a) EPC in conjunction with Article 54 EPC).

Auxiliary Requests

5. Auxiliary Requests I and II

5.1 Each claim 1 of auxiliary requests I and II differs from claim 1 of the main request in that:

- component (a) has been limited to pantothenol (dexpanthenol) and component (b) to xylometazoline, and

- specific amounts of components (a) and (b) in the composition have been defined (namely 0.01 to 10 wt.-% of component (a) and 0.001 to 2 wt.-% of component (b)).

Claim 1 of auxiliary request II further differs from claim 1 of the main request in that a specific pH value (of 5.0 to 6.0) has been defined.

5.2 Document D15 (also designated as D24) discloses the use of xylometazoline together with dexpanthenol for the intranasal treatment of rhinitis (see D15/D24, claims 1 and 6). Furthermore, document D15/D24 describes amounts and pH values that correspond to or are encompassed by the present claimed ranges (see D15/D24, claims 1 and 7-8, page 12 line 18 and formulation 1). In this context, the Board notes that the claims in document D15/D24 are formulated as dependent on each other. Consequently, the combination of features (claim 1 lower pH value of 5.0; claim 6, combination of xylometazoline and dexpanthenol; claims 7-8, weight ranges for each component) is clearly and directly disclosed. Each claim 1 of auxiliary requests I and II thus concerns the same active ingredient combination for use in the treatment of the same disease via the same administration route as described in document D15/D24.

5.3 As already explained for the main request, the Board considers the occurrence of systemic side effects due to the low systemic absorption of xylometazoline to be generally known to the expert and therefore to be avoided (see e.g., D3 and D13). The same argument regarding the absence of a truly new application as for the main request (see points 4.3 to 4.6) also applies in the case of auxiliary requests I and II.

5.4 In this context, the appellant argued that by defining specific properties of the composition in claims 1 of the present auxiliary requests, a further optimization of the reduction of the systemic absorption of xylometazoline and thus the reduction of the correlating systemic side effects has been achieved. Regardless of whether such optimization has actually been demonstrated, it does not change the argument regarding the novelty of the application, which already considers the embodiments according to the present claims 1 of auxiliary requests I and II.

5.5 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary requests I and II is therefore not novel compared to document D15/D24 (Article 54 EPC).

6. Auxiliary Request IIA

6.1 Claim 1 of auxiliary request IIA differs from claim 1 of auxiliary request II in that the feature ""whereby a vasoconstrictive effect is not extended to the cardiovascular system and side effects selected from hypertension, tachycardia, and reduced blood flow to peripheral body parts are avoided"" has been added from the description. This claim now includes as a purpose:

(i) a reduction in the systemic absorption of imidazoline-based alpha-sympathomimetics, and

(ii) the non-extension of the vasoconstrictive effect to the cardiovascular system along with the avoidance of side effects.

6.2 The Board believes that the expert would understand a non-extension or avoidance as absolute and not partially occurring. Furthermore, in light of the patent in dispute, it is clear that a reduction in the aforementioned systemic absorption can only lead to a reduction in the occurrence of side effects (see e.g., paragraph [0081]). Consequently, there is a contradiction between the two purposes (reduction in (i) versus avoidance in (ii)), which does not allow the expert to clearly determine the scope of protection of the present claim 1.

6.3 During the oral hearing, the appellant explained in this regard that the purpose (ii) does not concern an absolute avoidance of the extension of the vasoconstrictive effect to the cardiovascular system and the side effects but merely a reduction of these. The Board cannot share this interpretation. The paragraphs of the patent in dispute cited by the appellant, which are allegedly intended to support this interpretation, are unconvincing. Paragraphs [0026], [0028], [0038], and [0083] refer exclusively to the reduction of systemic absorption and do not even mention the extension to the cardiovascular system or side effects. Paragraphs [0030] and [0088] mention in addition to the reduction of systemic absorption even its prevention, so that an absolute avoidance of systemic absorption is actually also considered. Paragraphs [0081] and [0118] mention the ""reduction in the occurrence"" of side effects as well as the ""limitation or alleviation"" of the side effect in connection with the reduction of systemic absorption. Paragraph [0031] corresponds to the wording of the present claim and thus contains the same contradiction. Contrary to the appellant's opinion, these paragraphs do not indicate that only a reduction of side effects has been disclosed. On the contrary, both the reduction (""reduction in occurrence"", ""limitation"", ""alleviation"") and the avoidance (""prevention"") of side effects are described. This conclusion is consistent with the appellant's statements in their statement of appeal and their letter of August 22, 2019 (see statement of appeal, page 131, paragraph a), 2nd sentence; letter of August 22, 2019, page 44, point 2.a)). Consequently, the expert would interpret the purpose (ii) in light of its wording (""not [...] extended"" and ""avoided"") as directed towards an absolute avoidance of the undesired effect.

6.4 The Board thus concludes that claim 1 of auxiliary request IIA does not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC.

7. Auxiliary Request IIB

7.1 Admission

7.1.1 Auxiliary request IIB was submitted by the appellant with their statement of appeal on July 31, 2018. Its admission is therefore to be assessed according to Article 12(4) RPBA 2007 (Article 25(2) RPBA 2020).

7.1.2 This auxiliary request corresponds to the auxiliary request IIB submitted during the oral hearing before the opposition division on the second day of the hearing. In the first-instance proceedings, it was submitted late and not admitted into the proceedings as prima facie relevant. However, in the appeal proceedings, this auxiliary request was submitted at the beginning of the proceedings. Furthermore, it contains a single claim that corresponds to independent claim 15 of the patent in dispute. This independent claim was discussed by the parties in the appeal proceedings, and the deletion of the further claims compared to the main request does not change the situation regarding this independent claim.

7.1.3 The Board therefore sees no reason to exercise its discretion under Article 12(4) RPBA 2007 to exclude auxiliary request IIB from the appeal proceedings. Auxiliary request IIB is therefore part of the appeal proceedings.

7.2 Novelty

7.2.1 The claim of auxiliary request IIB differs from claim 1 of the main request primarily in that it concerns the use of pantothenol and/or pantothenic acid for the claimed purpose together and/or in combination with an imidazoline-based alpha-sympathomimetic, rather than the use of a combination therapeutic that contains both components. As emphasized by the appellant, this claim thus clarifies that the reduction of systemic absorption of imidazoline-based alpha-sympathomimetics is achieved thanks to the pantothenol and/or pantothenic acid component. However, the Board notes that this is already directly and unambiguously derivable from claim 1 of the main request. In the latter, pantothenol and/or pantothenic acid is indeed exclusively disclosed as the further component of the combination therapeutic alongside the imidazoline-based alpha-sympathomimetic. Since the imidazoline-based alpha-sympathomimetic component obviously does not itself reduce its systemic absorption, only the pantothenol and/or pantothenic acid component can fulfill the claimed purpose. The Board also notes that the claim of auxiliary request IIB still encompasses the combination therapeutic defined in claim 1 of the main request and the treatment also defined there.

7.2.2 The Board therefore believes that there is essentially no fundamental difference between the respective subjects of both claims. The arguments presented for claim 1 of the main request regarding novelty (see point 4.) thus apply mutatis mutandis to the present claim.

7.2.3 Finally, the Board notes that even if the focus on the pantothenol and/or pantothenic acid component would represent a difference from claim 1 of the main request, this difference would still need to lead to a new patient group and/or a truly new application in order to recognize novelty. For the reasons given in points 4.3 to 4.6, the Board believes that this is not the case, primarily because the use of both active ingredients and the possible side effects associated with systemic absorption were already known. The focus of the purpose on pantothenol and/or pantothenic acid does not change this situation.

7.2.4 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request IIB is therefore not novel compared to D13 (Article 54 EPC).

8. Auxiliary Requests III to VI

8.1 Claims 1 of auxiliary requests III to VI differ from claim 1 of auxiliary request II in that various features have been added that are disclosed in D15/D24.

8.1.1 The feature ""wherein at least one chemical buffer system is used to adjust and/or maintain the pH of the pharmaceutical composition, wherein a dihydrogen phosphate/monohydrogen phosphate buffer system is used as the chemical buffer system,"" introduced in claims 1 of auxiliary requests III to VI, is disclosed on page 13 (1st paragraph) as well as in claim 13 of D15/D24.

8.1.2 The feature ""and wherein all active and/or inactive ingredients are incorporated in the pharmaceutical composition, wherein the composition has a content of degradation product(s) of component (b) of at most 2 wt.-%, based on the active ingredient (b), and a content of degradation product(s) of component (a) of at most 2 wt.-%, based on the active ingredient (a),"" introduced in claims 1 of auxiliary requests IV to VI, is disclosed on page 17 as well as in claim 23 of D15/D24.

8.1.3 The feature ""and even after storage at temperatures in the range of 20 °C to 50 °C, at a pressure of 1,013.25 mbar, and at a relative humidity in the range of 50% to 90% for at least 6 months,"" introduced in claims 1 of auxiliary requests V and VI, is disclosed on page 17 as well as in claim 23 of D15/D24.

8.1.4 The specification of the degradation products of components (a) or (b) as ""namely impurity A"" or ""namely aminopropanol and/or D-pantolactone"" in claim 1 of auxiliary request VI is also disclosed on page 17 as well as in claim 23 of D15/D24.

8.2 In this context, the Board notes that the claims in document D15/D24 are formulated as dependent on each other. The corresponding features in the description are also disclosed as individual (preferred) embodiments and are thus combinable with further embodiments. Consequently, the combination of features is clearly and directly disclosed. The subject matter of each claim 1 of auxiliary requests III to VI is therefore not novel compared to D15/D24 for the same reasons as stated for auxiliary request II (see point 5.) (Article 54 EPC).

9. Auxiliary Requests VII to X

Each claim 1 of auxiliary requests VII to X contains the same feature as claim 1 of auxiliary request IIA. The auxiliary requests VII to X therefore do not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC for the same reasons as stated for auxiliary request IIA (see point 6.).","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided:, The appeal is dismissed., The request for reimbursement of the appeal fee is dismissed.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,"Teva GmbH, Wittkopp, Alexander, ZAKLADY FARMACEUTYCZNE POLPHARMA S.A., Bülle Dr., Jan",Teva GmbH Graf-Arco-Straße 3 89097 Ulm / DE,"Dörries, Hans Ulrich df-mp Fünf Höfe Theatinerstrasse 16 80333 München / DE","Wittkopp, Alexander Bogenallee 5 20144 Hamburg / DE",Hamm&Wittkopp Patentanwälte PartmbB Jungfernstieg 38 20354 Hamburg / DE,ZAKLADY FARMACEUTYCZNE POLPHARMA S.A. ul.

I. The Opponent 1 filed an appeal against the decision of the Opposition Division dated January 31, 2018, to maintain the European Patent EP 1 803 438 in amended form.

II. The contested patent is based on a divisional application according to Article 76 EPC. The corresponding parent application was filed on July 22, 2000, with the application number PCT/EP00/07052 as an international application under the PCT. Therefore, the maximum term of the contested patent ended on July 21, 2020 (Article 63(1) EPC in conjunction with Article 76 EPC).

III. By notice dated August 6, 2020, the parties were informed of this fact. The Appellant was given the opportunity, in accordance with Rule 84(1) in conjunction with Rule 100(1) EPC, to request the continuation of the opposition and thus the appeal proceedings.

IV. As indicated by a return communication received at the EPO on October 16, 2020, Opponent 2 (The Procter & Gamble Company) as another party to the proceedings, or their representative, did not receive the aforementioned notice due to an incorrect address. The notice was therefore re-delivered to them on October 26, 2020, granting a two-month period for a response.

V. The deadline for a request under Rule 84(1) EPC expired on October 16, 2020. No request for the continuation of the opposition proceedings was made. None of the parties to the proceedings submitted a response.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The maximum term of the contested patent expired on July 21, 2020. This is based on the fact that the earlier application, referenced in the filing of the contested patent under Article 76 EPC, was filed on July 22, 2000. According to Article 63(1) EPC, the term of the patent is 20 years from the filing date. According to Article 76(1) EPC, the filing date of a divisional application is the filing date of the earlier application.

The patent has therefore lapsed in all contracting states at the latest since July 21, 2020.

2. According to Rule 84(1) EPC, the opposition proceedings may be continued upon request of the opponent in the event of the patent's lapse in all contracting states, provided that the opponent makes such a request within two months of a notification from the European Patent Office regarding the lapse of the patent. According to Rule 100(1) EPC, this provision also applies in appeal proceedings.

3. In the present case, the opponent is also the sole appellant. The Board therefore issued a notification on August 6, 2020, under Rules 84(1) and 100(1) EPC, granting the appellant a two-month period to request the continuation of the opposition proceedings.

4. The notification under Rules 84(1) and 100(1) EPC was deemed to have been delivered to the appellant on August 16, 2020 (Rule 126(2) EPC). The deadline therefore expired on October 16, 2020. No request for the continuation of the opposition or appeal proceedings was made.

5. Opponent 2 (The Procter & Gamble Company) as another party to the proceedings, or their representative, did not receive the aforementioned notification due to an incorrect address.

According to the Board's legal opinion, Opponent 2, as a mere party to the proceedings, would not be entitled to reinstate an appeal proceeding abandoned by the sole appellant through a corresponding request under Rule 84(1) EPC (analogous to G2/91, OJ 1992, 206).

Nevertheless, Opponent 2 was given the opportunity to express their views on the factual and legal situation within a two-month period to ensure their right to be heard under Article 113(1) EPC, by notice dated October 26, 2020. No statement was received.

6. None of the parties to the proceedings have commented on the factual and legal situation. No requests were made.

The appeal proceedings are therefore concluded without a decision on the merits.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided:, The appeal procedure is concluded without a decision on the merits.",opposition procedure closed,opposition procedure closed,,"L'Oréal, The Procter & Gamble Company","L'Oréal 14, Rue Royale 75008 Paris / FR","L'Oreal, et al, et al Service D.I.P.I. 9, rue Pierre Dreyfus 92110 Clichy / FR","The Procter & Gamble Company One Procter & Gamble Plaza Cincinnatti, Ohio 45202 / US","Fiesser, Gerold Michael, et al, et al Mathys & Squire Theatinerstraße 7 80333 München / DE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeal of the appellant (opponent) is directed against the interim decision of the opposition division to maintain European Patent EP 2 802 553 in amended form under Article 101(3)(a) EPC.

II. The appellant filed an opposition against the grant of the patent, arguing lack of inventive step according to Article 100(a) and 56 EPC.

In the contested decision, the opposition division concluded that the amended set of claims and the adapted description submitted by the patent proprietor during the opposition proceedings did not go beyond the original application documents (Article 123(2) EPC), the scope of protection of the granted patent had not been extended (Article 123(3) EPC), the claims had not become unclear due to the amendments made (Article 84 EPC), and the claimed process was based on inventive step starting from D4 (US 5,254,736) as the closest prior art.

III. In her statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant argued, among other things, that the amendments made during the opposition proceedings had extended the scope of the claims (Article 123(3) EPC). Furthermore, the claimed process starting from D4 as the closest prior art would have been obvious to the skilled person (Article 56 EPC). She requested that the patent be revoked, alternatively, that an oral hearing be scheduled.

IV. In her response to the appeal, the respondent (patent proprietor) argued that the decision of the opposition division was correct. The objections raised under Articles 123(3) and 56 EPC were unfounded. A comparative test to support the inventive step was also submitted. She requested that the appeal be dismissed, alternatively, that an oral hearing be scheduled.

V. On December 10, 2020, the Board issued a communication under Rule 100(2) EPC, informing the parties of its preliminary assessment of the factual and legal situation. The Board was of the preliminary opinion that the objections of the appellant under Articles 123(3) and 56 EPC were justified.

VI. In a letter dated April 12, 2021, the respondent submitted a revised set of claims as a new main request for the maintenance of the patent in amended form in response to the Board's communication. Furthermore, she submitted revised sets of claims as auxiliary requests 1-7 and provided arguments as to why the amended sets of claims would be allowable under Articles 123(3) and 56 EPC.

VII. By summons dated June 28, 2021, the parties were summoned to oral proceedings on May 10, 2022.

VIII. In a letter dated September 29, 2021, the appellant requested that the new main request of the respondent and her new auxiliary requests no longer be admitted into the proceedings. The comparative test submitted with the response to the appeal should also not be taken into account.

IX. In a letter dated April 12, 2022, the respondent withdrew her request for oral proceedings.

She provided arguments as to why the newly submitted sets of claims should be admitted into the proceedings and why they would be allowable. Should these requests not be admitted, she alternatively requested that the appeal be dismissed, thus maintaining the patent in the same form as decided by the opposition division.

X. On May 5, 2022, the hearing scheduled for May 10, 2022, was canceled by the Board.

XI. The independent claim of the patent in the form maintained by the opposition division reads:

""Process for the preparation of secondary amines

I) by amination of alcohols selected from methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol or mixtures of these compounds or from isopropyl alcohol, 2-butanol, cyclopentanol or cyclohexanol

II) with primary amines of the formula III

R3-NH2        III

wherein R3 is selected from the group of linear or branched aliphatic residues with 1 to 15 carbon atoms, cycloaliphatic residues with 5 to 10 carbon atoms, aralkyl residues or phenyl residues which may be substituted in the o-, m- and/or p-position by aliphatic residues with 1 to 4 carbon atoms,

III) and hydrogen in the liquid phase in the presence of hydrogenation catalysts, comprising the following steps:

i)   feeding the alcohols, primary amines of formula III, hydrogen and optionally solvents into the hydrogenation reactor, wherein the molar ratio of alcohol to primary amine is 1.5 to 20 to 1,

ii) carrying out the hydrogenation at temperatures of 150 to 210°C and pressures of 1 to 300 bar in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst containing copper on oxidic supports.""

The independent claim of the newly submitted main request in the appeal proceedings contains the additional feature ""wherein the copper oxide-containing catalyst precursor contains 10 to 80% copper oxide"" at the end of the claim.

In the independent claim of the newly submitted first auxiliary request in the appeal proceedings, this copper oxide content is restricted to 20 to 80%.

The independent claims of auxiliary requests 2-7 also contain one of these newly introduced features; their exact wording is irrelevant for the decision.

XII. The requests of the parties are as follows:

The appellant requests that the contested decision be overturned and the patent be revoked.

In this context, she requests that the sets of claims newly submitted as main and auxiliary requests in the appeal proceedings not be admitted into the appeal proceedings, nor the test data submitted with the response to the appeal.

Alternatively, she requests an oral hearing.

The respondent requests that the patent be maintained on the basis of the main request, alternatively on the basis of auxiliary requests 1-7, all requests submitted with the letter dated April 12, 2021, in amended form. Furthermore, she alternatively requests that the appeal be dismissed.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. A decision in written proceedings is permissible. The request of the appellant for revocation of the patent is granted, as detailed below. Therefore, their auxiliary request for oral proceedings is moot. The respondent withdrew their auxiliary request for oral proceedings in a letter dated April 12, 2022. The Board therefore does not consider it appropriate to hold oral proceedings under Article 116(1) EPC.

3. Admission of the requests submitted in the appeal proceedings into the proceedings

3.1 The respondent requests the maintenance of the patent in amended form based on one of the sets of claims submitted as main or auxiliary requests on April 12, 2021.

3.2 These sets of claims were submitted in response to the Board's communication under Rule 100(2) EPC. The decision on the admission of these requests into the appeal proceedings is therefore made in accordance with Article 13(1) RPBA 2020.

3.3 Under Article 13(1) RPBA 2020, a change to the appeal submissions after the submission of the response to the appeal requires justifying reasons and is at the discretion of the Board. In exercising this discretion, the procedural status and the question of whether the changes are detrimental to procedural economy are particularly taken into account. Furthermore, it is considered whether the change prima facie addresses the issues raised by another party or the Board.

3.4 The significant change introduced in claim 1 of the main request is the introduction of a lower limit for the copper oxide content in the precursor of the catalyst used in the reaction. This is defined in the main request as well as in auxiliary requests 2, 4, and 6 with the feature ""wherein the copper oxide-containing catalyst precursor contains 10 to 80 wt-% copper oxide."" In auxiliary requests 1, 3, 5, and 7, the lower limit is 20%.

A lower limit regarding the copper oxide content in the catalyst or its precursor had not been a technical feature of an independent claim up to this point in either the opposition or appeal proceedings.

3.5 When submitting the requests, the respondent did not provide justifying reasons regarding the late submission. One year after submitting the requests, they stated in their letter dated April 12, 2022, that the changes were a response to questions raised for the first time in the Board's communication under Rule 100(2) EPC and therefore had to be admitted.

In particular, it was stated that the view expressed in the contested decision, that D4 does not suggest the use of nickel catalysts with low copper content as catalysts for the amination of short-chain alcohols using an excess of alcohol, was first challenged there. The submission of new claims that set a lower limit for the copper content thus only became necessary at that time.

3.6 This argument is not convincing. Already in the statement of appeal, page 6 bottom to the end of page 7, the appellant stated that D4 discloses the alcohol excess for the amination of short-chain alcohols and that D4 would disclose copper oxide-containing catalysts for a claim-compliant reaction. The same argument was also presented in the opposition proceedings (see point 5.1 of the contested decision).

The fact that the Board considers the submissions of the opponent regarding an objection already raised in the opposition proceedings to be convincing, in contrast to the opposition division, does not justify that auxiliary requests directed at this objection are only submitted at this advanced stage of the proceedings.

3.7 The same applies to the amendments directed against the objection under Article 123(3) EPC. In this case, the Board has also merely adopted the opponent's viewpoint in its preliminary assessment. This objection was also raised in the opposition proceedings (see point 4.1 of the contested decision) and reiterated in the statement of appeal (pages 4/5).

3.8 The introduction of a lower limit for the copper oxide content in the catalyst precursor raises questions that were not previously discussed in either the opposition or appeal proceedings. For example, it would need to be examined whether the imposed restriction distinguishes the claims from D4, since the copper contents there are specified based on copper in the catalyst, not on the basis of copper oxide in the catalyst precursor, as stated in the appellant's submission of September 29, 2021 (point 2.3.2). Furthermore, it would need to be discussed whether D4 or other documents disclose catalysts with a claim-compliant copper content or suggest them for the claimed use. The Board can neither see that the changes made prima facie address the existing objections nor that the submission of these requests would be beneficial to procedural economy.

3.9 The Board therefore exercises its discretion granted under Article 13(1) RPBA 2020 by not admitting the newly submitted main request and auxiliary requests 1-7 into the proceedings.

4. Patent in the version maintained by the opposition division

4.1 The respondent has requested, in the alternative, that the appeal be dismissed, i.e., to maintain the patent in the amended form accepted by the opposition division.

4.2 The appellant has argued that this amended version violates various provisions of the EPC; therefore, the patent should not be maintained based on this version. Specifically, they raised objections under Articles 123(2) and (3), 84, and 56.

4.3 In the Board's view, the method defined in claim 1 of the patent in the maintained version is derivable in an obvious manner from D4 for the skilled person. The requirement of inventive step under Article 56 EPC is therefore not fulfilled.

4.3.1 Both parties and the opposition division consider D4 to be the closest prior art, and the Board agrees.

D4 discloses analogous aminations of alcohols. Example 1 of D4 discloses, for example, an amination of methanol with dodecylamine at 40 bar and 180°C. The molar ratio of alcohol to amine used is 19.5. Other claim-compliant ratios are shown in Table II. In these examples, ""Ni 1404 T"" is used as the catalyst, which according to column 4, lines 58ff. is nickel deposited on kieselguhr. The general teaching of D4 also refers to nickel-based catalysts, see for example column 2, lines 35-45.

4.3.2 The present claim 1 requires a hydrogenation catalyst that contains copper on oxidic supports.

4.3.3 Since no improved properties compared to the methods of D4 have been demonstrated, the technical problem was to find an alternative method for the amination of alcohols to D4. The technical problem was also defined this way in the contested decision, and neither party has argued otherwise, so the Board concurs.

4.3.4 The claimed solution to the problem consists of the method according to claim 1, which is characterized in particular by the use of a hydrogenation catalyst that contains copper on oxidic supports. That the problem has been solved is undisputed.

4.3.5 In the contested decision, the opposition division concluded that the replacement of nickel catalysts with copper catalysts was not suggested for the skilled person, particularly in combination with the use of an excess of alcohol.

The Board first notes that claim 1 does not require a copper catalyst at all, but rather a catalyst that contains copper on oxidic supports. The presence of other metals, such as nickel, is not excluded.

Catalysts containing copper on oxidic supports are already described in D4 as possible catalysts, for example in column 4, lines 45-57. At the end of this paragraph, nickel/copper systems supported on alkali carbonates with copper contents of 1-10 wt.% are explicitly referred to as part of the invention. Specifically, the catalyst Ni 5189D is mentioned, which contains 18% nickel and 2% copper on a 7% aluminum oxide support (the rest is distearylamine to form a paste). This catalyst is also used in D4, for example in Example 26.

Although the respondent correctly argued that D4 describes two types of reactions, namely the claimed one and another in which the required excesses of alcohol are not necessarily used (see column 2, lines 45-62), no distinction is made regarding the applicability of the catalysts described in columns 4 and 5 in the two reactions.

A skilled person would therefore already have known from the closest prior art that claim-compliant catalysts containing copper on an oxidic support can be used in the reaction defined in the claim.

4.3.6 The respondent submitted another comparative example using a catalyst C in their response to the appeal. This example is intended to show that catalysts with high nickel contents behave differently than catalysts with high copper contents. However, this example is irrelevant for the present claims. The claims contain no restriction on the copper or nickel contents of the catalysts. Both catalysts used in the comparative examples contain copper on oxidic supports and are therefore compliant with the claims. Regardless of the question raised by the appellant regarding the admission of this data into the appeal proceedings, they do not change the substantive assessment of inventive step.

5. In summary, it should be noted that the amendments made to the patent in the appeal proceedings are not admitted into the proceedings under Article 13(1) RPBA 2020. The patent in the amended version from the opposition proceedings does not meet the requirement of Article 56 EPC and is therefore to be revoked in accordance with Article 111(1) in conjunction with Article 101(3)(b) EPC.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided:, The contested decision is revoked., The patent is revoked.",patent revoked,patent revoked,patent revoked,Nouryon Chemicals International B.V.,Nouryon Chemicals International B.V.

I. The applicant filed an appeal against the decision of the examining division dated December 11, 2017, to refuse European patent application No. 06 829 216.8.

II. The examining division had decided that the then-applicable main request did not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, and that the then-applicable auxiliary request 1 was excluded from patentability under Article 53(c) EPC.

III. The appellant (applicant) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the grant of a patent based on the main request or auxiliary request 1, both submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal.

Furthermore, he requested the reimbursement of the appeal fee.

IV. In a communication dated June 2, 2020, the Board informed the appellant of its preliminary opinion that the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request was not novel (Article 54(5) EPC) and that the subject matter of claim 1 of the auxiliary request was excluded from patentability (Article 53(c) EPC).

The Board also indicated that the request for reimbursement of the appeal fee was not justified and was likely to be rejected.

V. In a letter dated June 16, 2021, the appellant withdrew his participation in the scheduled oral proceedings and requested a decision based on the written record.

VI. The following documents are mentioned in this decision:

- D3: EP 0 555 807A;

- Product information ""Tricos"", manufacturer Baxter Deutschland GmbH BioSurgery;

VII. The independent claims have the following wording:

a) Main request:

""Bone adhesive comprising calcium phosphate cements and their granules for use in a method for treating bone lesions and for sealing a root canal in the apical region, wherein the apical region of the root canal is sealed in preparation for a secure root canal filling with a separate apical sealing plug comprising the bone adhesive, wherein the bone adhesive penetrates from the apical region into the surrounding tissue by overfilling, and the bone adhesive does not extend more than 1/10 of the total root canal length into the root canal.""

b) Auxiliary request 1:

""Non-therapeutic use of bone adhesive selected from the group comprising calcium phosphate cements or their granules for sealing the apical region of a root canal, wherein the bone adhesive is used in preparation for a root canal filling.""

VIII. The appellant essentially argued as follows:

Main request

The bone adhesive is a chemical substance that exerts an immediate and indirect medical effect in the claimed method. The requirements of Article 54(5) EPC are therefore fulfilled.

Firstly, the bone cement fixes potential bone lesions. Furthermore, it has a prophylactic effect by preventing the ingress of bacteria into the root canal during treatment. Even after the resorption of the bone adhesive, the ingress of bacteria is prevented by filling the root canal only to 1/10 of its length. This allows all dentinal tubules along the root canal to be permanently sealed by a conventional root canal filling. Therefore, it constitutes a second medical indication of the bone adhesive within the meaning of G 2/08 and G 6/88.

Auxiliary request 1

Claim 1 of the auxiliary request is restricted to non-therapeutic uses of the bone adhesive. Examples include the treatment of dead teeth for purely cosmetic reasons or filling an extracted tooth in dental technology.

The subject matter of the claim therefore does not fall under the exclusion criteria of Article 53(c) EPC.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Main Request - Article 54(5) EPC

1.1 The formulation of the main request aims at the recognition of novelty based on a specific further medical use of a known substance or substance mixture according to Article 54(5) EPC.

1.2 Bone adhesives comprising calcium phosphate cements and their granules were undisputedly already generally known at the time of filing the patent application. Examples of this can be found in document D3, page 4, line 19 - page 6, line 31 (second embodiment), and the product information ""Tricos"" submitted by the appellant.

1.3 Novelty could thus only be recognized in the sense of a second medical use if the conditions for the application of Article 54(5) EPC are met.

1.4 Article 54(5) EPC requires, on the one hand, that the claim is directed to a substance or substance mixture, and on the other hand, that it is a specific application of the substance or substance mixture in a method referred to in Article 53 c) EPC, whereby this application must not belong to the state of the art.

1.5 The ""blocking of a root canal in the apical region"" by a separate apical sealing plug containing a bone adhesive, where the ""bone adhesive penetrates from the apical region into the surrounding tissue by overfilling,"" constitutes a method within the meaning of Article 53 c) EPC. In this respect, the appellant is to be agreed with.

The explicitly mentioned ""overfilling,"" i.e., the penetration of the bone adhesive from the apical region into the surrounding tissue, displaces the endogenous tissue present there and can, in addition to the usual risks of injection (infection, bleeding), lead to damage to nerves, blood vessels, and other structures present there due to the associated space-occupying effect. The method thus represents a significant physical intervention in the body, the execution of which requires medical expertise and which, even when performed with the necessary professional care and competence, is associated with a substantial health risk. It is thus a surgical procedure.

The appellant also rightly points out that the claimed method constitutes a ""prophylactic therapeutic treatment"" (appeal letter, page 4, 3rd paragraph).

1.6 The second requirement for the application of Article 54(5) EPC is that the claimed ""bone adhesive comprising calcium phosphate cements and their granules"" must be a substance or substance mixture within the meaning of this article.

1.7 The question of what falls under the terms substance or substance mixture in the sense of Article 54(5) EPC has been the subject of several decisions by the Boards of Appeal (see in particular T 1758/15, Reasons 5.2; T 2136/15, Reasons 1; T 2003/08, Reasons 17, 18). In summary, the Boards have interpreted that it must be a substance or substance mixture that exerts an effect in the claimed, novel method as such. The effect must be caused by the substance or substance mixture itself, not by a macrostructure formed from the substance or substance mixture.

1.8 The appellant argued that the claimed bone adhesive exerts both an immediate and an indirect medical effect on the periodontal apparatus.

1.8.1 The immediate medical effect of the bone adhesive is seen in its ability to fix bone lesions.

However, this effect corresponds to the well-known effect of any such bone adhesive. Therefore, this effect cannot establish novelty in the sense of a second medical use for this reason alone.

1.8.2 The indirect effect is based on the formation of a blockage in the sense of a sealing plug. The positioning of the sealing plug in the apical region prevents the subsequently introduced root filling material from exiting the root canal in the apical direction. This thereby prophylactically prevents irritations and infections.

While the sealing plug consists of a substance or substance mixture, as is the case with any other product, it is not the substance or substance mixture that exhibits the effect, but the macrostructure formed from this substance or substance mixture (see: T 2136/15, Reasons 1.1 ff and in particular 1.6 as well as T 2003/08, Reasons 17, 18).

In particular, the novelty claimed by the appellant specifically lies in the length of the sealing plug of a maximum of 1/10 of the root canal length. This also does not represent a material property of the bone adhesive.

The indirect effect of the blockage is therefore, in the sense of the interpretation provided above, not an effect of the substance or substance mixture and cannot serve as a basis for recognizing novelty for the claimed bone adhesive comprising calcium phosphate cements and their granules according to Article 54(5) EPC.

1.9 The subject matter of claim 1 according to the main request is therefore not novel.

2. Auxiliary Request 1 - Article 53 c) EPC

2.1 Claim 1 of the auxiliary request defines a use of bone adhesive for blocking the apical region of a root canal and has been limited to non-therapeutic methods.

However, the claimed method includes, even if it is applied only for cosmetic purposes, the overfilling of the apical region mentioned in the description (application, page 7, penultimate paragraph). As stated above, this constitutes a surgical procedure.

2.2 It is true that - as mentioned by the appellant - a purely dental treatment of extracted or accidentally dislodged teeth falls under the claim wording. However, for the exclusion from patentability under Article 53 c) EPC, it is sufficient if the claim encompasses a surgical treatment of the human or animal body.

Since this is the case in the present claim, Article 53 c) EPC precludes the granting of a patent with this claim.

3. Request for Refund of the Appeal Fee

The appellant has requested the refund of the appeal fee without specifying which of the conditions for a refund mentioned in Rule 103 EPC would apply. The request is therefore unsubstantiated and must be rejected.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",the application has been refused,the application has been refused,appeal dismissed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, reference is made to the experimental data of the patent proprietors (respondents) in their submission of December 22, 2017.

IV. The opposition division decided that the subject matter of granted claim 4 (for the wording, see point 3) was novel over D1 and based on this document as the closest prior art, involved an inventive step. The opposition division particularly concluded that the provision of a crystalline Afatinib salt, i.e., crystalline Afatinib dimaleate, was already unexpected in itself and that an inventive step could be recognized even without comparative tests against the closest prior art. However, comparative tests could still be used as additional support for the recognition of inventive step. These comparative tests would only need to refer to examples or other compounds already produced in D1, such as the free base of Afatinib. Comparisons to compounds that are merely encompassed by the teaching of D1 but not explicitly disclosed therein could not be required.

V. With their statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant submitted, among other documents, the following:

VI. With their response to the appeal, the respondents submitted sets of claims for auxiliary requests 1 to 4.

VII. As requested, the parties were summoned to an oral hearing. In preparation for this, the board issued a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA 2020 with a preliminary opinion on certain decisive points.

VIII. The oral hearing before the board took place on July 9, 2021, in the presence of the parties. During this hearing, the respondents for the first time in the appeal proceedings argued that the Afatinib salts referred to by the appellant in D25 and D26 were not reproducible. They later withdrew this objection but emphasized that it was unclear what was meant by the ""dimaleate form R"" mentioned in D26. At the end of the oral hearing, the chairman announced the decision's operative part.

IX. The appellant requested the annulment of the challenged decision and the revocation of the patent in dispute in its entirety.

The respondents requested

- the dismissal of the appeal

- alternatively, the maintenance of the patent in dispute in amended form based on the sets of claims of auxiliary requests 1 to 4 submitted with their response to the appeal.

X. The relevant arguments of the appellant for the present decision can be summarized as follows.

The subject matter of claim 4 is not novel over the closest prior art D1. At most, this subject matter differs from D1 in that a specific Afatinib salt is claimed, namely the dimaleate. Neither the submission of the respondents from December 22, 2017, nor D18 provides evidence of improved properties for Afatinib dimaleate compared to other Afatinib salts, particularly not regarding improved solubility, stability, hygroscopicity, and/or crystallinity/crystallization tendency. Furthermore, D25 shows that Afatinib succinate and Afatinib dihydrochloride have higher solubility in water and various buffer media, and D26 shows that Afatinib dihydrochloride and Afatinib dioxalate are more stable than the patent-in-suit form A of Afatinib dimaleate. Although the patent-in-suit form A of Afatinib dimaleate has very low hygroscopicity, claim 4 is not limited to this form. It also encompasses other crystalline forms of Afatinib dimaleate. The anhydrous and crystalline forms B and M of Afatinib dimaleate disclosed in D8 and D33 are significantly more hygroscopic than the patent-in-suit form A and also more hygroscopic than Afatinib salts of acids proposed in D1 alongside maleic acid for salt formation. Therefore, the technical effect of low hygroscopicity observed for form A cannot be achieved across the entire breadth of claim 4. Regarding crystallinity and crystallization tendency, there is a contradiction between D18 and the submission of the respondents from December 22, 2017. In the mentioned submission, Afatinib salts are described as crystalline, which according to D18 are supposedly only accessible in amorphous form. Moreover, other crystalline Afatinib salts are also disclosed in D8. In D11, the appellant demonstrated that Afatinib succinate and Afatinib L-lactate are available in crystalline form. Consequently, it cannot be concluded that it was difficult to provide a crystalline Afatinib salt in the form of crystalline Afatinib dimaleate at the time of filing. Furthermore, the effects claimed by the respondents were not plausibly demonstrated in the application as originally filed. The objective technical problem can therefore only be seen in the provision of a salt of Afatinib suitable for pharmaceutical use. D1 already proposes maleic acid as an acid for salt formation. Additionally, the skilled person would have considered the use of two equivalents of maleic acid in comparison to Afatinib promising in light of (i) the pKa values of the two carboxyl groups of maleic acid, (ii) the pKa values of the two protonated groups in Afatinib, and (iii) the requirement known from general technical knowledge that there must be a sufficiently large pKa difference between the acid and the protonated form of the base for salt formation. Therefore, the subject matter of claim 4 of the main request does not involve an inventive step.

The subject matter of claim 4 of auxiliary request 1 is not inventive for the same reasons as claim 4 of the main request.

The application as originally filed discloses specific reflections only for the patent-in-suit form A of Afatinib dimaleate via X-ray diffractometry. However, the associated list of reflections has not been fully included in claim 4 of auxiliary requests 2 and 3. Thus, claim 4 of auxiliary requests 2 and 3 does not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

The subject matter of claim 4 of auxiliary request 4 is not inventive based on the anhydrous free base of Afatinib disclosed in D1. In particular, the respondents did not present a comparison between the claimed form A of Afatinib dimaleate and the free base of Afatinib. Therefore, a technical effect cannot be recognized. The objective technical problem must be seen in the provision of an alternative. It is routine for the skilled person to provide salts of a pharmaceutical active ingredient. Furthermore, finding a defined crystalline form without a technical effect associated with it cannot, according to the established case law of the boards of appeal, constitute an inventive step. Therefore, the subject matter of claim 4 of auxiliary request 4 does not involve an inventive step.

XI. The relevant arguments of the respondents for the present decision can be summarized as follows.

D1 is the closest prior art. To arrive at the subject matter of claim 4 of the main request starting from D1, four selections must be made from the disclosure of D1. Therefore, the subject matter of claim 4 is novel. The claimed Afatinib dimaleate exhibits a combination of advantageous properties regarding solubility, stability, hygroscopicity, and crystallinity/crystallization tendency. The respondents have demonstrated this with their results for the patent-in-suit form A of Afatinib dimaleate in D18 and in their submission of December 22, 2017. The stability comparisons made in D26 do not allow for convincing conclusions, as nothing is known about the decomposition mechanism of the compared salts and, in particular, nothing about the influence of the already present but differently sized amounts of impurities on this. The comparisons made in D25 and D26 are, moreover, not meaningful because the appellant has only used the measurement results provided in D18 without measuring the patent-in-suit form A of Afatinib dimaleate itself. The crystalline forms B and M of Afatinib dimaleate known from D8 and D33 are post-published and should therefore not be considered in an objection of lack of inventive step. That the respondents described such Afatinib salts as crystalline in their submission of December 22, 2017, which they could previously (D18) only have obtained in amorphous form, is a correct representation of the experimental results. The difference is due to a different content of impurities in the starting materials. The results demonstrate that Afatinib salts are difficult to crystallize. The crystalline Afatinib salts cited by the appellant in this context and known from D8 are post-published. Even D11 can only demonstrate that the crystallization of Afatinib salts is difficult, if at all. The objective technical problem is therefore seen in the provision of a form of Afatinib with advantageous properties. That this problem is solved by Afatinib dimaleate is surprising. Therefore, the subject matter of claim 4 of the main request involves an inventive step.

The subject matter of claim 4 of auxiliary request 1 involves an inventive step for the same reasons as claim 4 of the main request.

The patent-in-suit form A of Afatinib dimaleate has been measured by X-ray diffractometry. The associated reflections are disclosed in the table on page 11 of the application as originally filed. It is general technical knowledge that only the reflections with the highest relative intensity are necessary to characterize a crystalline form such as form A. By limiting to reflections with a relative minimum intensity of > 20% and > 10% in claim 4 of auxiliary requests 2 and 3, no other compound is claimed. That this must be allowable can also be derived from the reasoning given in decision T 1684/16. Therefore, the subject matter of claim 4 of auxiliary requests 2 and 3 cannot go beyond the subject matter of the application as originally filed.

The subject matter of claim 4 of auxiliary request 4 is directed to the patent-in-suit form A of Afatinib dimaleate. As stated by the respondents and confirmed by the appellant in D35, this form has the lowest hygroscopicity of all tested salts. The board therefore agrees that the objective technical problem must at least be seen in the provision of another physiologically acceptable compound with extremely low hygroscopicity. Neither D1 nor any of the other cited documents provide, starting from the free base of Afatinib disclosed in D1, a hint towards the now claimed form. Therefore, the subject matter of claim 4 of auxiliary request 4 involves an inventive step.","Reasons for the Decision

1. In its decision pursuant to Article 15 (1) VOBK 2020, the Board pointed out that the appellant had only referred in a general manner to the grounds for opposition under Article 100 b) and 100 c) EPC in its statement of grounds of appeal, but that these grounds had neither been the subject of the opposition proceedings nor been substantiated in the present appeal proceedings. When addressed on this point during the oral proceedings, the appellant waived further elaboration. Consequently, the present appeal proceedings were limited to the ground for opposition under Article 100 a) EPC (G 10/91 (OJ 1993, 420), No. 3 of the decision).

2. The main request of the respondents is directed towards the dismissal of the appeal and thus towards the maintenance of the contested patent in its unamended form.

3. The objections raised by the appellant were directed exclusively against the granted independent claim 4. This claim reads:

""4-[(3-Chlor-4-fluorophenyl)amino]-6-{[4-(N,N-dimethylamino)-1-oxo-2-buten-1-yl]-amino}-7-((S)-tetrahydrofuran-3-yloxy)-quinazoline dimaleate.""

In agreement with both parties, the compound mentioned in claim 4, 4-[(3-Chlor-4-fluorophenyl)amino]-6-{[4-(N,N-dimethylamino)-1-oxo-2-buten-1-yl]-amino}-7-((S)-tetrahydrofuran-3-yloxy)-quinazoline, will hereinafter be referred to as Afatinib. It has the following structure:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

Claim 4 is thus directed to a specific compound, namely the dimaleate salt of Afatinib. However, claim 4 does not restrict the solid-state structure of Afatinib dimaleate in any way. Therefore, the subject matter of claim 4 encompasses not only the only crystalline form of Afatinib dimaleate disclosed in the contested patent (which will hereinafter be referred to as 'Form A' in accordance with the parties), but also other crystalline forms (i.e., further polymorphs) of Afatinib dimaleate.

Main Request - Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

4. The only novelty objection raised by the appellant was based on D1.

D1 (page 1, lines 6 to 16) relates to

""... quinazoline derivatives of the general formula

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

their tautomers, their stereoisomers, and their salts, in particular their physiologically acceptable salts with inorganic or organic acids ...""

(emphasis added)

Furthermore, D1 discloses (page 16, lines 18 to 23) that to convert the compounds of the above formula I into their physiologically acceptable salts

""... hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, phosphoric acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid or maleic acid ...""

can be used. In addition, Afatinib is mentioned in lists of compounds formed according to the above formula I (page 30, lines 2 to 5 (Example 1(10)); claim 4, compound (j)).

5. In this context, the respondents argued that a fourfold selection from the disclosure of D1 would be required to arrive at the subject matter of claim 1:

i) Salts must be selected from the tautomers, stereoisomers, and salts,

ii) Afatinib must be selected from the lists of compounds according to formula I,

iii) Maleic acid must be selected from the acids proposed for salt formation, and

iv) among the salts that can be formed between Afatinib and maleic acid, the one with the claimed stoichiometry must be selected, i.e., the di-maleate.

Since there is a clear indication (""pointer"") in D1 regarding the preference for salts (see the emphasis above in the passage on page 1, lines 6 to 16), the Board cannot agree with the respondents that the restriction to such a selection in claim 4 amounts to a selection from D1. However, the Board accepts in favor of the respondents that points ii) to iv) are features by which the subject matter of claim 4 differs from D1. As already noted in the contested decision, the subject matter of claim 4 is therefore novel with respect to D1.

Main Request - Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

6. The parties unanimously considered D1 to be the closest prior art. The Board saw no reason to deviate from this unanimous view.

7. In assessing inventive step, the question must be answered as to whether the above selections from the disclosure of D1, i.e., the distinguishing features ii) to iv), are associated with a technical effect or not. Since the present consideration is based on salts of the compounds of formula I, the Board holds, contrary to the view expressed in the contested decision, that to demonstrate a technical effect associated with the selection(s), a comparison must be made between Afatinib dimaleate on one side and other salts encompassed by the above disclosure (such as salts of Afatinib formed with hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, phosphoric acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, or tartaric acid).

7.1 The respondents pointed to the following properties of Afatinib dimaleate to demonstrate a technical effect: solubility, stability, crystallinity/crystallization tendency, and hygroscopicity. These properties are addressed in the contested patent (paragraphs [0018] to [0021]) and in the application as originally filed (hereinafter referred to for simplicity as the 'original application') (see there page 9, paragraph 3 to page 10, paragraph 2). Contrary to the appellant's assertions, the Board finds it plausible that an invention based on one or more of these properties was made as of the filing date of the contested patent. In this context, the post-published documents submitted by the respondents are therefore to be considered in the assessment of inventive step (Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, ninth edition, 2019, I.D.4.6 and the decisions cited therein). This view was also expressed by the Board in its communication pursuant to Article 15 (1) VOBK 2020 and was not challenged by the appellant during the oral proceedings.

7.2 Regarding the aforementioned properties in detail

7.2.1 Solubility

In the experimental report D18 submitted by the respondents (point 5.2), the solubility of the contested patent's Form A of Afatinib dimaleate in various media is stated. However, comparisons with other salts that could allow conclusions regarding the selection of Afatinib, maleic acid, and/or their stoichiometry are not made.

The experimental report D25 submitted by the appellant compares the solubilities of Afatinib succinate and Afatinib dihydrochloride with that of the contested patent's Form A of Afatinib dimaleate. In their response to the appeal (page 8, third-to-last paragraph), the respondents argued without further justification that the only comparable data in D25 relate to the phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and 7.5, where in both cases the contested patent's Form A of Afatinib dimaleate is superior to both the succinate and the dihydrochloride. In this regard, the Board expressed in its decision pursuant to Article 15(1) VOBK 2020 the preliminary view that this conclusion cannot be drawn because the respective solubilities are only given in the form of overlapping ranges. This was not challenged by the respondents during the oral proceedings. Consequently, no conclusions can be drawn from D25 regarding the selection of Afatinib, maleic acid, and/or their stoichiometry.

7.2.2 Stability

In the experimental report D18 submitted by the respondents (point 3.2), the stability of the contested patent's Form A of Afatinib dimaleate under various conditions (storage time, temperature, relative humidity) is stated. However, comparisons with other salts that could allow conclusions regarding the selection of Afatinib, maleic acid, and/or their stoichiometry are not made.

The experimental report D26 submitted by the appellant compares the stability of the contested patent's Form A of Afatinib dimaleate with that of Afatinib dihydrochloride, Afatinib dioxalate, and a ""dimaleate form R."" The Board agrees with the respondents that it is not clear what ""dimaleate form R"" refers to, and in particular, how it can be obtained (see point VIII above). This compound will therefore not be further considered. Similarly, Afatinib dioxalate will not be considered, as it is not relevant for a comparison of the contested patent's Afatinib dimaleate with D1, which does not propose oxalic acid for salt formation.

The contested patent's Form A initially has impurities of 0.6%. When stored at 25 °C and 60% relative humidity (40 °C and 75% relative humidity), this proportion increases to 0.7% (1.4%) after four weeks and to 0.8% (2.1%) after eight weeks. In comparison, the dihydrochloride initially has impurities of <0.05%. After four or eight weeks of storage under the aforementioned conditions, this proportion increases only very slightly (after four weeks: <0.05% (0.09%); after eight weeks: 0.09% (0.10%)). The observable trends are seen by the Board as evidence that the contested patent's Form A of Afatinib dimaleate decomposes at least as quickly as Afatinib dihydrochloride and thus does not provide any advantage in terms of stability. Therefore, it is also not apparent why the selection of Afatinib, maleic acid, and/or their stoichiometry should be associated with a technical effect regarding stability.

It should be noted that the respondents considered the comparisons drawn by the appellant in D26 to be generally unsuitable. The appellant merely adopted the stability data of the contested patent's Form A of Afatinib dimaleate from D18. However, they did not simultaneously determine the stability of this form, for example, with that of the dihydrochloride. Furthermore, nothing is known about the decomposition mechanism of the compared salts and, in particular, what influence the already present but differently sized amounts of impurities have on this. These arguments are not relevant in that if they were taken into account, D26 would have to be completely disregarded in the assessment of inventive step, which would not change the above conclusion based solely on D18.

7.2.3 Hygroscopicity

In their submission of December 22, 2017, the respondents demonstrated that the contested patent's Form A of Afatinib dimaleate exhibits the lowest hygroscopicity among the tested salts. The amount of water absorbed by this Form A up to a relative humidity of 80%, determined by DVS ('dynamic vapor sorption'), namely < 0.5%, was confirmed by the appellant in their own measurements (statement of grounds of appeal, table on page 19 and the following paragraph).

However, the subject matter of claim 4 is not limited to the contested patent's Form A of Afatinib dimaleate, but also encompasses, as already noted above, other crystalline forms of Afatinib dimaleate. The appellant referred to documents D8 and D33. These disclose the preparation of further forms of Afatinib dimaleate, namely forms B (D8: Example 5) and M (D33: Example 22). The post-processing described in D34 by the appellant shows that these are crystalline and anhydrous forms of Afatinib dimaleate. As shown in D35, the two forms B and M, with absorbed water amounts of 12.08% and 13.62%, respectively, exhibit significantly higher hygroscopicity than the contested patent's Form A of Afatinib dimaleate. The hygroscopicity of forms B and M is even worse than that of other Afatinib salts, whose acid component is proposed in D1 for salt formation (see Afatinib difumarate (7%) or Afatinib monobromide (11%) in the respondents' submission of December 22, 2017). That the anhydrous and crystalline forms B or M of Afatinib dimaleate disclosed in D8 and D33 fall within the subject matter of claim 4 was not disputed by the respondents, nor were the results obtained for these two forms regarding significantly higher hygroscopicity.

It must therefore be concluded that while a surprising technical effect has been demonstrated for the contested patent's Form A of Afatinib dimaleate, this is not achieved across the entire breadth of claim 4 and, in particular, not for the also claimed forms B and M.

The respondents argued in this context that a comparison of the claimed Form A with forms B and M is not permissible, as the test results D8 and D33 to D35 are all post-published. Furthermore, these two forms were not known or at least not accessible to the skilled person on the priority date. However, the reference point for assessing inventive step is the filing or priority date. The appellant's attempt to argue inventive step based on forms of Afatinib dimaleate that were not known or accessible on the priority date of the contested patent has no basis in the EPC.

The Board cannot agree with this.

According to the established case law of the Boards of Appeal, post-published evidence submitted by patent holders (similarly by patent applicants) is taken into account to demonstrate that the claimed subject matter solves the stated problem if it is already credible based on the disclosure contained in the patent that the problem has indeed been solved, i.e., if the solution to the problem already appears plausible at the time of filing (Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, ninth edition, 2019, I.D.4.6 and the decisions cited therein). This has already been affirmed in the present case, see above. Therefore, the fact that D8 and D33 to D35 are post-published does not preclude their consideration.

The argument that the evidence D8 and D33 to D35 regarding forms B and M must remain unconsidered because these forms were not known on the priority date is also unconvincing. The fact that embodiments falling under the claim were not known at the priority date of a contested patent cannot lead to the conclusion that these embodiments can be disregarded in the assessment of inventive step. Otherwise, the recognition of novelty, and thus the determination that the embodiments falling under the claim are not known from the prior art, would automatically necessitate the recognition of inventive step, rendering Article 56 EPC moot.

In fact, the opposite is true. According to established case law, to acknowledge inventive step, the problem must be solved across the entire scope defined in the patent claim, i.e., for all embodiments falling within this scope (Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, ninth edition, 2019, I.D.4.4.1). In a demonstration that aims to prove the occurrence of a technical effect across the entire breadth of a contested claim, a patent holder may also refer to those embodiments that fall under the subject matter of the contested claim but are not described in the prior art. That this must be the case is a direct consequence of the problem-solution approach, whereby a patent holder must address, for example, a closest prior art that was unknown to them at the time of filing the application. These considerations must equally apply to opposers. Therefore, the opposer (here the appellant) can also make use of post-published evidence (here D8 and D33 to D35) that relates to embodiments falling under the claim wording (here forms B and M) and are not described in the prior art.

Finally, the argument that the appellant's evidence D8 and D33 to D35 must be disregarded because forms B and M were not accessible to the skilled person at the priority date does not hold.

Accessibility of forms B and M at the priority date must be affirmed in the present case. At the priority date, screening for solid forms of a drug and characterizing these forms was routine in the pharmaceutical industry. The mere provision of additional crystalline forms of Afatinib dimaleate (such as the aforementioned forms B and M disclosed in D8 and D33) as a result of such routine investigations does not involve inventive step (T 777/08, No. 5.2 of the reasons, eighth paragraph; T 2007/11, No. 7.7.1 of the reasons) and is thus not associated with any unreasonable effort. The forms B and M in question were therefore available to the skilled person in terms of sufficient disclosure at the priority date. Accordingly, the evidence D8 and D33 to D35 relating to these two forms submitted by the appellant must be considered.

7.2.4 Crystallinity/Crystallization Tendency

In D18 (point 4), the respondents report on their attempts to obtain salts of Afatinib in crystalline form. Of all the salts examined, only the dimaleate was found to be crystalline. The respondents viewed this as an indication that Afatinib dimaleate has a stronger ability to crystallize than other salts. This is said to be an inherent property of Afatinib dimaleate. This also justifies that claim 4 is not limited to crystalline Afatinib dimaleate.

The Board does not find this convincing, as the results described in D18 contradict those also submitted by the respondents in their submission of December 22, 2017. In that submission, attempts are also reported to obtain salts of Afatinib in crystalline form. However, in addition to Afatinib dimaleate, Afatinib salts in crystalline form could also be obtained, which were allegedly not possible according to D18. The explanation provided by the respondents for the contradictory results, namely that these are due to different purities of the starting materials used, does not, in the Board's view, lead to the conclusion that Afatinib dimaleate necessarily has a greater intrinsic tendency to crystallize than other salts. Furthermore, it is exacerbated in the present case that

- the appellant has shown with their experimental results in D11 that Afatinib forms crystalline salts with both succinic acid and L-lactic acid, i.e., acids proposed in D1 for salt formation, and

- that D8 also describes various crystalline salts of Afatinib with acids proposed in D1 for salt formation, namely Afatinib disulfate (Fig. 9), Afatinib dimesylate (Fig. 13), Afatinib diphosphate (Fig. 15), and Afatinib difumarate (Fig. 20). This was also explicitly acknowledged by the respondents (response to the appeal, page 7, penultimate paragraph).

In their response to the appeal (page 7, penultimate paragraph), the respondents also argued regarding the crystalline salts of Afatinib disclosed in D8 that these are post-published. However, as noted above, this does not preclude their consideration.

Thus, it is also not apparent regarding crystallinity/crystallization tendency why the selection of Afatinib, maleic acid, and/or their stoichiometry should be associated with a technical effect.

7.3 Overall, no technical effects or combinations of advantageous properties are apparent that would be associated with the selection of Afatinib, maleic acid, and/or their stoichiometry and that occur across the entire breadth of claim 4.

8. The objective technical problem must therefore be formulated less ambitiously than the provision of a physiologically acceptable compound suitable for the pharmaceutical application envisaged in D1.

9. Starting from D1, the skilled person would not have had to engage in inventive activity to arrive at the subject matter of claim 4.

As already stated above, D1 proposes maleic acid for salt formation and Afatinib as the actual active ingredient for the formation of physiologically acceptable salts, which are (self-evidently) suitable for the pharmaceutical application envisaged in D1. Without a technical effect associated with these selections, they are arbitrary and do not require inventive activity. Furthermore, as pointed out by the appellant with reference to D19 (page 20, last paragraph) and not disputed by the respondents, it is generally known that Afatinib contains two protonatable groups. In the Board's view, the skilled person would have routinely employed two equivalents of the acid in their attempts to obtain a crystalline salt of Afatinib with an acid, even if, as in the present case, it is a diprotic acid like maleic acid. Moreover, this approach would have been associated with a high expectation of success for the skilled person in light of

- the pKa values of the two carboxyl groups of maleic acid (D20: pages 8-46) and the protonated groups in Afatinib (D19: page 20, last paragraph), as well as

- the requirement known from general knowledge for salt formation between bases and acids, namely that there must be a sufficiently large pKa difference between the acid and the protonated form of the base (D6: page 202, paragraph 2; D3: page 166, paragraph 1; D3a: page 137, last paragraph to page 138, paragraph 1).

Even if, as argued by the respondents, the stated pKa values were to refer to aqueous systems, this would not contradict the above conclusion, as the skilled person regularly uses these as a guideline for the respective acid/base strength in other solvents as well.

The subject matter of claim 4 therefore does not involve an inventive step, and the main request is not allowable.

10. The above disclosure of D1, which is based on the salts of the compounds of formula I, is considered by the Board to be at least an equivalent starting point for assessing inventive step compared to the disclosure of the free base Afatinib itself. Since, as shown above, no inventive step can be recognized starting from the salts of the compounds of formula I, there is no need to assess inventive step starting from the free base of Afatinib disclosed in D1. In this context, the comparisons conducted by the respondents in D18 regarding the free base of Afatinib are also not relevant.

Auxiliary Request 1 - Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

11. Claim 4 of auxiliary request 1 has the following wording:

""Crystalline 4-[(3-Chlor-4-fluorophenyl)amino]-6-{[4-(N,N-dimethylamino)-1-oxo-2-buten-1-yl]-amino}-7-((S)-tetrahydrofuran-3-yloxy)-quinazoline dimaleate.""

The claim thus differs from claim 4 of the main request only in that it is directed to the crystalline compound, i.e., crystalline Afatinib dimaleate. This constitutes an additional distinguishing feature over D1.

12. In the evidence discussed above, there is nowhere a comparison of an amorphous and a crystalline form of the same salt. A technical effect associated with the additional distinguishing feature (""crystalline"") over D1 is therefore not apparent. The objective technical problem is thus again seen in the provision of a physiologically acceptable compound suitable for the pharmaceutical application envisaged in D1.

Starting from D1, however, the skilled person would again not have had to engage in inventive activity to arrive at the subject matter of claim 4, as it is part of their routine to provide a crystalline form of an active ingredient (T 777/08, No. 5.2 of the reasons, eighth paragraph; T 2007/11, No. 7.7.1 of the reasons) - even if the transition to the crystalline form were to be associated with a change in properties expected by the skilled person (improved filterability and dryability, lower solubility, see T 777/08, No. 5.1 and 5.2 of the reasons).

The subject matter of claim 4 therefore does not involve an inventive step, and auxiliary request 1 is not allowable.

Auxiliary Requests 2 and 3 - Amendments (Article 123 (2) EPC)

13. Claim 4 of auxiliary requests 2 and 3 reads as follows:

13.1 Auxiliary Request 2

""Crystalline 4-[(3-Chlor-4-fluorophenyl)amino]-6-{[4-(N,N-dimethylamino)-1-oxo-2-buten-1-yl]-amino}-7-((S)-tetrahydrofuran-3-yloxy)-quinazoline dimaleate, characterized by the following diffraction angle determined by CuKalpha radiation with a wavelength of lambda = 1.5418 Å:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC""

13.2 Auxiliary Request 3

""Crystalline 4-[(3-Chlor-4-fluorophenyl)amino]-6-{[4-(N,N-dimethylamino)-1-oxo-2-buten-1-yl]-amino}-7-((S)-tetrahydrofuran-3-yloxy)-quinazoline dimaleate, characterized by the following diffraction angle determined by CuKalpha radiation with a wavelength of lambda = 1.5418 Å:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC""

13.3 The subject matter of claim 4 of auxiliary requests 2 and 3 is thus directed to crystalline Afatinib dimaleate, which is further characterized by a combination of X-ray powder reflections.

14. X-ray powder reflections are disclosed in the original application in the table on page 11. The reflections listed there were obtained during the X-ray powder diffractometric investigation of the contested patent's Form A of Afatinib dimaleate. The corresponding XRPD spectrum is shown in Figure 1.

14.1 As can be seen from the comparison of the tables provided above with the one on page 11 of the original application, the tables included in claim 4 of auxiliary requests 2 (11 reflections) and 3 (17 reflections) are shortened versions of the table on page 11 of the original application (39 reflections).

According to the respondents, this must be allowable. It is general knowledge that for the characterization of a crystalline compound, it is sufficient to state only those reflections that exhibit the highest relative intensity. This is the case here, as the reflections listed in claim 4 of auxiliary requests 2 and 3 are those from the table on page 11 of the original application that have a relative intensity of > 20% (auxiliary request 2) or > 10% (auxiliary request 3). Thus, the same compound is still claimed. The subject matter of claim 4 of auxiliary requests 2 or 3 cannot therefore exceed the content of the original application.

The Board cannot agree with this, if only because the respondents' reference to general knowledge has not been substantiated. Furthermore, there is no teaching in the original application that

- the 11 or 17 reflections listed in claim 4 of auxiliary requests 2 and 3 or

- those reflections listed in the table on page 11 of the original application with a certain minimum relative intensity

are sufficient for the characterization of the contested patent's Form A of Afatinib dimaleate. In this context, the inclusion of only selected reflections in claim 4 of auxiliary requests 2 and 3 adds the technical teaching that those with a relative intensity of > 20% or > 10% are sufficient for identification. Moreover, these lower limits appear completely arbitrary, as reflections with a relative intensity of exactly 20% or exactly 10% are also mentioned in the table on page 11 of the original application, and it is not clear why these should not be necessary for the characterization of the contested patent's Form A of Afatinib dimaleate.

The above conclusion is consistent with the decision T 1684/16, according to which the disclosure that a certain crystalline form can be characterized by the selection of certain selected reflections goes beyond the content of the originally filed application if this selection does not emerge directly and unambiguously therefrom (see points 2.2 to 2.4 of the reasoning).

The respondents held a contrary view and referred to page 8, paragraph 2, last sentence of this decision:

""Lastly, figures 1, 4, 10 and 11 [of the application as filed] show x-ray diffraction patterns (XRDP) of different forms of bosutinib (Forms I to VI) and do not teach the selection of the five peaks of claim 1 of the patent as granted, since those peaks are, for instance, not the most significant peaks in terms of intensity."" (Insertion in square brackets by the Board)

The finding that the selection of peaks of lower intensity is not directly and unambiguously derivable from the original application does not necessarily allow the reverse conclusion that the selection of the most intense peaks, let alone a specific number of the most intense peaks, is directly and unambiguously derivable from the original application. Therefore, the cited passage from the decision T 1684/16 does not contradict the above conclusion that the restriction of reflections to those with a certain minimum relative intensity adds a technical teaching and thus goes beyond the subject matter of the original application.

Auxiliary Request 4 - Amendments (Articles 123 (2) and (3) EPC) and Clarity (Article 84 EPC)

15. Claim 4 has the following wording:

""Crystalline 4-[(3-Chlor-4-fluorophenyl)amino]-6-{[4-(N,N-dimethylamino)-1-oxo-2-buten-1-yl]-amino}-7-((S)-tetrahydrofuran-3-yloxy)-quinazoline dimaleate, characterized by the following diffraction angle determined by CuKalpha radiation with a wavelength of lambda = 1.5418 Å:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC""

16. The table included in claim 4 of auxiliary request 4 corresponds to the table on page 11 of the original application. Claim 4 of auxiliary request 4 thus meets the requirements of Article 123 (2) EPC. This was not disputed by the appellant.

17. The appellant did not raise any objections under Article 123 (3) or Article 84 EPC. The Board is satisfied that the subject matter of claim 4 of auxiliary request 4 meets the requirements of these articles.

Auxiliary Request 4 - Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

18. In their statement of grounds of appeal (page 24, first paragraph), the appellant merely stated in a general manner that the subject matter of claim 4 of auxiliary request 4 is not novel for the same reasons as claim 4 of the main request. However, the appellant did not take into account at all that claim 4 of auxiliary request 4 is directed to a specific crystalline form of Afatinib dimaleate, namely the contested patent's Form A. The objection raised in the statement of grounds of appeal is therefore not convincing. Furthermore, during the oral proceedings before the Board, the appellant did not raise any novelty objection based on D1. The Board therefore concludes that the subject matter of claim 4 of auxiliary request 4 is novel over D1.

Auxiliary Request 4 - Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

19. The appellant raised an objection of lack of inventive step only against claim 4, and this only based on the free base of Afatinib disclosed in D1.

As already stated above, claim 4 relates to the contested patent's Form A of Afatinib dimaleate.

The appellant argued that

- the free base of Afatinib disclosed in D1 is anhydrous and can be regarded as a starting point for assessing inventive step,

- the claimed Form A of Afatinib dimaleate differs from the anhydrous free base in that it is a specific crystalline form with two maleate anions,

- the respondents did not compare the claimed Form A of Afatinib dimaleate with the anhydrous free base of Afatinib disclosed in D1,

- accordingly, no technical effect is apparent and the objective technical problem is merely seen in providing an alternative, and

- the solution to this problem cannot be inventive.

The Board cannot agree with this. Even if there is no comparison between the now claimed Form A of Afatinib dimaleate and the (allegedly) anhydrous free base of Afatinib disclosed in D1, it must still be considered that the respondents have demonstrated in their submission of December 22, 2017, the extremely low hygroscopicity of the claimed Form A of Afatinib dimaleate (see above). Even if one assumes in favor of the appellant that the free base of Afatinib disclosed in D1 also exhibits extremely low hygroscopicity, the objective technical problem would still be seen in providing another physiologically acceptable compound with extremely low hygroscopicity, and not merely in providing a physiologically acceptable compound. The solution to the more challenging objective technical problem requires inventive activity starting from the free base of Afatinib disclosed in D1, as neither D1 nor any other prior art suggests the preparation of the form A mentioned in claim 4, let alone that such preparation is suggested in connection with low hygroscopicity. The skilled person addressing the above-stated problem starting from D1 would therefore have had no motivation to prepare this form.

The subject matter of claim 4 and - in the absence of further objections from the appellant against other claims of auxiliary request 4 - also the other claims of auxiliary request 4 therefore involve an inventive step. Auxiliary request 4 is therefore allowable.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is revoked. 2.

I. European Patent No. 1 536 753 was granted with 7 claims. Claim 1 of the patent read as follows:

""1. A method for cosmetic treatment to improve and/or protect the dermal-epidermal junctions of the skin, scalp, and mucous membranes, characterized in that a preparation containing at least one substance that modulates Plectin/HD1 and/or Entactin/Nidogen and/or Perlecan is applied topically,

wherein the substance is selected from the group consisting of an extract from the plant Pisum sativum, Ruscus Aculeatus, Centella asiatica, Calendula Officinalis, Aesculus Hippocastanum, and/or Hibiscus esculentus and Mannitol, Cyclodextrin, yeast extract, Panthenol, Propylene Glycol, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, disodium succinate, and low molecular weight peptides.""

Claims 2-6 related to the cosmetic uses of a substance as defined in claim 1. Claim 7 related to cosmetic preparations containing at least one substance as defined in claim 1 and their specific effect.

II. An opposition was filed against the grant of the patent. The grounds for opposition cited were lack of novelty and lack of inventive step (Article 100 a) EPC) as well as insufficient disclosure (Article 100 b) EPC).

III. The Opposition Division decided to maintain the patent in amended form based on the main request submitted on January 9, 2018 (originally submitted as ""Auxiliary Request V"").

IV. The sole claim of the main request read:

""1. Cosmetic use of a substance against hair loss and for improving hair properties, which substance modulates Plectin/HDI and/or Entactin/Nidogen and/or Perlecan and is selected from the group consisting of an extract of the plant Pisum sativum, Ruscus Aculeatus, Centella asiatica, Calendula Officinalis, Aesculus Hippocastanum, and/or Hibiscus esculentus.""

D9: WO 99/62481 A1

D11: US 5 443 855 A

VI. The Opposition Division stated in its decision in particular:

a) Documents D3/D5, D4, D6, D8, and D11 did not directly disclose a use against hair loss, so that the novelty of the main request was given.

b) D6, D9, and D11 were potential closest prior art. A use against hair loss was not specifically disclosed in these documents. The objective problem was to provide further uses against hair loss. None of the other documents cited by the opponent taught a relation to the problem of hair loss that could lead the skilled person in an obvious manner to the claimed subject matter. Thus, the main request fulfilled the requirements of Article 56 EPC.

VII. The opponent (appellant) filed an appeal against the above decision.

VIII. In the response to the appeal dated January 4, 2019, the respondent referred to the maintained claims as the main request and to 8 auxiliary requests (auxiliary requests VI-XIII submitted on January 9, 2018, with auxiliary request XII originally submitted on May 2, 2017, as auxiliary request VII).

The claim of auxiliary request VI is based on the claim of the main request, wherein the list of substances was restricted to an ""extract of the plant Pisum sativum.""

The claim of auxiliary request VII is based on the claim of the main request, with the following features added:

- ""for the protection of the dermal-epidermal junctions"" (added after the feature ""Cosmetic use of a substance""), and

- ""Mannitol, Cyclodextrin, yeast extract, Panthenol, Propylene Glycol, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, disodium succinate, and low molecular weight peptides"" as further substances.

The claim of auxiliary request VIII is based on the claim of auxiliary request VII, wherein the plant extracts were further defined by the feature ""which have a similar sequence to components of Plectin/HDI and/or Entactin/Nidogen and/or Perlecan.""

The claim of auxiliary request IX is based on the claim of auxiliary request VIII, wherein the substances ""Mannitol, Cyclodextrin, yeast extract, Panthenol, Propylene Glycol, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, disodium succinate"" were deleted.

The claim of auxiliary request X is based on the claim of the main request, wherein the feature ""for the protection of the dermal-epidermal junctions"" was added after the feature ""Cosmetic use of a substance.""

The claim of auxiliary request XI combines the modifications made in auxiliary request VI and auxiliary request X.

The claim of auxiliary request XII reads:

""1. Cosmetic use of a substance for the protection of the dermal-epidermal junctions of the skin, scalp, and mucous membranes against UV light exposure, which substance modulates Plectin/HDI and/or Entactin/Nidogen and/or Perlecan and is selected from the group consisting of an extract of the plant Pisum sativum, Ruscus Aculeatus, Centella asiatica, Calendula Officinalis, Aesculus Hippocastanum, and/or Hibiscus esculentus.""

The claim of auxiliary request XIII is based on the claim of auxiliary request XII, wherein the list of substances was restricted to an ""extract of the plant Pisum sativum.""

IX. The following evidence relevant to the decision was submitted by the parties during the appeal proceedings:

X. An oral hearing took place before the Board on June 23, 2021.

XI. The appellant (opponent) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent. Furthermore, it requested that the auxiliary requests not be admitted into the appeal proceedings.

XII. The respondent (patent proprietor) requested as the main request that the appeal be dismissed. Alternatively, it requested that the patent be maintained on the basis of one of the auxiliary requests VI-XIII submitted on January 9, 2018. Furthermore, it requested that the new ground for opposition under Article 100 a) EPC in conjunction with Article 53 c) EPC, the new objection under Article 84 EPC, and documents D13-D19 not be admitted into the appeal proceedings.

XIII. The arguments of the appellant relevant to the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) Documents D13-D19 should each be seen as a response to prior procedural steps and therefore should be admitted into the proceedings.

b) D3/D5, D4, D8, D11, D13, and D16 disclosed uses of pea extracts for improving hair properties and implicitly their use against hair loss. D14 and D15 described the use of pea extracts as anti-apoptotic substances, among others against hair loss. As confirmed by paragraph [0015] of the contested patent, a use against hair loss already constitutes an improvement of hair properties and thus anticipates the claimed subject matter. Furthermore, it is part of general knowledge that apoptosis of hair cells leads to graying of hair. Consequently, D14/D15 implicitly disclosed the improvement of this hair property. The subject matter of the main request is therefore not novel.

c) Starting from D11 as the closest prior art, the technical problem to be solved is to provide a further alternative use of pea extracts. D14 and D15 described the use of phytogenic anti-apoptotic pea extracts against hair loss. There is nothing to prevent a combination of the teachings from D11 and D14 or D15. The skilled person would therefore have considered the proposed solution to be obvious. The subject matter of the main request thus lacks inventive step. The argumentation based on D16 as the closest prior art leads to the same conclusion.

d) Auxiliary requests VII-IX and XII-XIII should not be admitted into the proceedings as they violate the principle of prohibition of reformatio in peius.

e) Auxiliary requests VI, X, and XI do not involve an inventive step. In particular, the feature introduced in auxiliary requests X and XI has no limiting effect.

XIV. The arguments of the respondent relevant to the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) Documents D13-D19 are not procedurally relevant and should therefore not be admitted into the proceedings.

b) D3/D5, D4, D8, D11, D13, and D16 did not disclose any use against hair loss, and a use for improving hair properties cannot be directly and unambiguously derived from D14-D15. The subject matter of the main request is thus novel.

c) The subject matter of the main request differs from the subject matter of D11 not only by the use against hair loss but also because D11 does not clearly and unambiguously disclose the use of pea extracts for improving hair properties. The technical problem to be solved therefore consists in providing a specific use of pea extracts. The skilled person would not have combined the teachings from D11 and D14 or D15, among other reasons because these documents focused on different active ingredients. A use of the claimed extracts against hair loss and for improving hair properties is therefore not obvious. Consequently, the subject matter of the main request is inventive.

d) Auxiliary requests VII-IX and XII-XIII should be admitted into the proceedings to allow a lawful defense of the patent in response to the newly highlighted facts arising from the submission of documents D13-D16 in the appeal proceedings.

e) Similar to the main request, auxiliary requests VI, X, and XI involve an inventive step. It would not have been obvious to the skilled person to use the specific extract defined in auxiliary request VI for the uses described in D11 or D14 and D15 in connection with different active ingredients. The additional feature introduced in auxiliary request X establishes a further use that is neither disclosed nor obvious in the cited prior art. The same applies to auxiliary request XI, which consists of a combination of auxiliary requests VI and X.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Admission of New Evidence

1.1 Documents D13-D16 were submitted with the statement of appeal before January 1, 2020. The admission of these documents is therefore to be assessed according to Article 12(4) RPBA 2007 (Article 25(2) RPBA 2020).

These documents relate to pea extracts and their properties. Documents D13-D16 were submitted by the appellant in response to the decision of the opposition division to acknowledge novelty and inventive step for the amended main request based on the use against hair loss. The respondent argued that documents D13-D16 should have been submitted during the opposition proceedings, as the current main request corresponds to granted claim 6. However, the board notes that the granted claims contained a variety of effective substances (14 generically defined substances, see claim 1 as granted) and different uses (see independent claims 2-6 as granted). In particular, granted claim 6 included a higher number of different substances than the claim of the present main request (14 vs. 6 generically defined substances in granted claim 6 vs. the present claim). According to the preliminary opinion of the opposition division, the subject matter of granted claim 6 also did not involve any inventive step (see paragraph 7.7.5 of the annex to the summons for oral proceedings). Furthermore, the present main request was submitted only after the communication of the aforementioned preliminary opinion, namely two months before the oral proceedings, as an auxiliary request in the opposition proceedings. Thus, the submission of documents D13-D16 is a reaction to not necessarily foreseeable developments in the proceedings, and accordingly, these documents are admitted into the proceedings.

1.2 Documents D17-D18 were submitted after the statement of appeal but before the summons for oral proceedings was dispatched. The admission of these documents is therefore to be assessed according to Article 13(1) RPBA 2020. Since the board does not consider these documents suitable for supporting the relevant factual submissions of the appellant, the board does not admit these documents into the proceedings.

1.3 Document D19 was submitted after the dispatch of the summons for oral proceedings after January 1, 2020. The admission of this document is therefore to be assessed according to Article 13(2) RPBA 2020.

The appellant justified the late submission of this document by stating that it demonstrates general technical knowledge and was submitted in response to the doubts regarding the achievement of an improvement in hair properties through the suppression of hair apoptosis mentioned for the first time in the preliminary opinion of the board.

However, the board is not convinced that the teaching of D19, on which the appellant's argumentation is based, can be attributed to general technical knowledge and furthermore does not recognize any exceptional circumstances that could justify the admission, so this document is not admitted.

Main Request

2. Interpretation of the Claim

2.1 The present claim relates to the cosmetic use of one of the claimed substances ""against hair loss and for the improvement of hair properties."" The appellant argued that the contested patent does not provide a definition of the improvement of hair properties and that, in view of paragraph [0015] of the contested patent, the prevention of hair loss represents a subset of the improvement of hair properties. According to the appellant, this interpretation is also in line with the generally known fact that the prevention of hair loss consists of a shift in the ratios of hair follicles in the anagen phase versus the telogen phase. A higher number of hair follicles in the anagen phase therefore already represents an improvement in hair properties. Thus, any description of an effect against hair loss in the prior art implicitly discloses an improvement in hair properties.

2.2 The board cannot agree with this argument. The wording of the present claim is clear and states that the use against hair loss and the use for improving hair properties are to be considered as different uses. Since both uses are connected by the coordinating conjunction ""and,"" these uses are to be understood as two distinct uses that both need to be achieved. Regardless of its interpretation, the individual paragraph [0015] of the contested patent cannot alone call this clear wording of the claim into question. The board therefore believes that the skilled person would interpret claim 1 as claiming a use against hair loss and additionally a use for improving another hair property that is different from hair loss.

2.3 However, the board notes that the hair properties to be improved are not further defined in the contested patent. This feature is therefore to be interpreted broadly, meaning that it encompasses any hair property except for hair loss (see point 2.2). The respondent's argument that the claimed hair properties can only represent inherent hair properties (i.e., for example, no change in the appearance of the hair through external means such as hair conditioners or hair treatments) is therefore not convincingly substantiated.

3. Novelty

3.1 Novelty over D3/D5, D4, D8, D11, D13, and D16.

3.1.1 The appellant based their objection of lack of novelty over D3/D5, D4, D8, D11, D13, and D16 essentially on the argument that these documents disclose an explicit use for improving hair properties and an implicit use against hair loss.

3.1.2 However, such an implicit disclosure cannot be derived from these documents.

a) D3/D5 relate to the treatment of the skin and, among other things, skin inflammations with, for example, a shampoo (see D3 column 1 paragraph from line 33 and example 15). However, a direct connection between skin inflammation and hair loss cannot be inferred from D3/D5. The appellant has not substantiated their assertion that alleviating scalp inflammation necessarily leads to a reduction in hair loss. The board further notes that according to G2/88, the inherent occurrence of a non-medical use is not fundamentally detrimental to novelty.

b) D4 relates to a topically applied formulation for the skin and/or epithelial appendages for protection against stress (see composition and claim 1). A use against hair loss cannot be inferred from document D4.

c) D8 discloses the cosmetic use of plant extracts such as Pisum sativum to increase the amount of collagen IV in the DEJ (see claim 5). However, D8 does not specifically relate to the treatment of hair. In particular, a use of Pisum sativum as an anti-hair loss agent is not clearly and directly derivable.

d) D11 discloses cosmetic compositions based on plant extracts (including Pisum sativum) for beautifying hair (see column 3 paragraph from line 40 and examples 4, 11, and 12). However, an effect against hair loss is neither mentioned nor implicitly disclosed. The appellant has not substantiated their assertion that the described increase in moisture (see column 5 paragraph from line 45) inherently leads to a reduction in hair loss. As explained in point 3.1.2 a), such an inherent occurrence would not be fundamentally detrimental to novelty in the absence of any prior publication.

e) D13 relates to a composition for treating human hair, in particular for restoring vital hair (see page 2 line 10). The composition contains a combination of biotin and a glycoprotein that can be obtained, among other things, from pea extract (see page 1 line 37 and claims 1 and 4). The appellant argued that the treatment performed in D13 achieves an increase in the fullness and volume of the hair (reference to page 2 line 10), which implies a higher number of hairs on the head. The board cannot see how the ""maintenance or restoration of healthy hair and a full head of hair"" necessarily implies an implicit prevention of hair loss. An improvement in the structure of the hair and thus its own volume and fullness can occur independently of hair loss (i.e., also independently of the follicle growth cycle). The fact presented by the appellant that biotin is used by the body to produce keratin is also not sufficient to directly and clearly disclose an effect against hair loss. The same applies to the claimed use for increasing protein production in human cells (see claim 15), as no specific protein is described. That a reduction in hair loss might occur does not mean that it necessarily does, let alone that it can be inferred from D13. As explained in point 3.1.2 a), an inherent effect is anyway not fundamentally detrimental to novelty in the absence of any prior publication.

f) D16 discloses an emulsion that contains, among other things, a pea protein hydrolysate from Pisum sativum for hair treatment, in particular for strengthening the hair (see page 1 last paragraph and example 1). The strengthening of the hair is assessed by a hairdresser. The board therefore understands that this strengthening represents a hair conditioning property, i.e., a property relevant for hairstyling. The mentioned strengthening does not seem to be related to a possible hair loss. The appellant has further presented a similar argument regarding the disclosure of D13 concerning the improved fullness and volume. For the same reasons as explained in point 3.1.2 e), this argument is not convincing.

3.2 Novelty over D14 and D15

3.2.1 D14 and D15 relate to anti-apoptotic compositions for the treatment of hair loss. Pea extracts are mentioned as possible anti-apoptotic agents (see D14 page 5 line 18 and page 23 lines 13-29; D15 column 6 line 37 and column 14 lines 50 and 56-60). A use for improving hair properties is not explicitly disclosed. The board is also not convinced that such a use is implicitly disclosed.

3.2.2 The appellant's argument that the prevention of hair loss already represents an improvement in hair properties is, for the reasons stated above (see point 2.2), not relevant for the present claim.

3.2.3 The appellant further argued that it is general technical knowledge that the anti-apoptotic effect implicitly also represents an effect against greying of hair and thus an improvement in hair properties. However, the board notes that neither the prevention of greying of hair nor the prevention of the specific apoptosis of melanocytes (which, according to the appellant, leads to greying) is mentioned in D14 and D15. These documents only refer to the apoptosis of hair follicle cells in general and specifically to combating hair loss. Therefore, a truly inherent effect of the substances disclosed in D14/D15, particularly the pea extracts, on the greying of hair has not been convincingly substantiated. As already mentioned in connection with D3/D5, D11, and D13, an inherent occurrence of an effect is anyway not fundamentally detrimental to novelty in the absence of any prior publication.

3.3 Consequently, the main request meets the requirements of Article 54 EPC.

4. Inventive Step

4.1 Closest Prior Art

4.1.1 Both the opposition division and the appellant considered D11 as a possible closest prior art. The board shares the same view. The choice of D11 as a possible closest prior art was not contested by the respondent.

4.1.2 D11 relates to the beautification of hair (see column 3 paragraph from line 40 and examples 11 and 12) and thus the improvement of hair properties (see point 2.3). D11 further describes the use of an extract of Pisum sativum (see example 4).

4.2 Difference

4.2.1 The subject matter of the present claim differs from the cosmetic use disclosed in D11 by the additional use against hair loss (see point 3.1.2 d)).

4.2.2 Regarding the difference between the present subject matter and the disclosure of D11, the respondent further argued during the oral proceedings as follows:

i) D11 focuses on extensin and its effect. Accordingly, in example 4, not only is a Pisum sativum extract produced, but a raw extensin preparation is made. Furthermore, no specific use for this preparation is described.

ii) D11 (see columns 4 and 5) describes hair conditioners and further states that the disclosed effect occurs through the formation of a film. These uses are based on external treatments and therefore do not represent a change in an inherent hair property. Thus, the use for improving hair properties should be considered as another difference from D11.

4.2.3 The board cannot share this viewpoint for the following reasons:

i) D11 generally describes cosmetic compositions that are used for the purpose of improving hair properties (see column 3 paragraph from line 40), and that plant extracts containing extensin such as Pisum sativum can be used (see column 3 and example 4). The fact that no specific use of the preparation from example 4 is substantiated does not change this general disclosure. The board believes that the skilled person would understand from D11 that extensin-containing Pisum sativum extracts have the described effect. In this context, it should be noted that the claimed extracts are not restricted regarding the extraction method and the substances contained. The description of the contested patent also does not provide any information regarding the composition of the extracts and the extraction method. Furthermore, the preparation disclosed in example 4 of document D11 is a ""raw"" preparation, i.e., not a pure extensin preparation. Other ingredients are therefore not excluded. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the preparation described in example 4 corresponds to the present extracts.

ii) D11 generally refers to the beautification of hair and specifically describes a method for moisturizing hair (see column 5). In light of the above interpretation of the claim (see point 2.3), these effects are considered improvements in hair properties.

4.3 Objective Technical Problem

Consequently, the objective technical problem starting from D11 is to provide a further cosmetic use of pea extracts. This formulation aligns with the problem formulated by both parties.

4.4 Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

4.4.1 D14 and D15 teach the anti-apoptotic effect and the treatment of hair loss using phytogenic apoptosis inhibitors or phospholipids that can be obtained from pea extracts (see D14 page 5 lines 16-18, page 6 line 19, and page 23 lines 13-29; D15 column 6 line 37, column 14 lines 50 and 56-60, and claim 44). Consequently, D14-D15 suggest to the skilled person the use of pea extracts.

4.4.2 The respondent argued that the skilled person would not have referred to D14 or D15 and thus would not have combined their teachings with that of D11 for the following reasons:

a) D14 or D15 and D11 pertain to different technical fields,

b) since apoptosis is associated with cancer, the skilled person would have only reluctantly used the means described in D14 or D15 for cosmetic applications,

c) a clear connection between pea extracts or Elirex and the use against hair loss cannot be inferred from D14 or D15, and

d) D11 focuses on extensin, while D14 and D15 describe the effect of phospholipids. The skilled person would therefore not have seen any reason to combine the teachings of these documents, which refer to different active substances.

4.4.3 D11 and D14 or D15 belong to the same technical field, namely the use of phytogenic substances, particularly substances obtained from peas, inter alia for cosmetic applications (see points 4.1.2 and 4.4.1). As stated above (see point 4.3), the technical problem to be solved is merely to provide a further cosmetic use of pea extracts. The board therefore believes that the skilled person would have referred to any document that describes a cosmetic use of pea extracts to solve this technical problem.

4.4.4 Since D14 and D15 already disclose cosmetic uses for treating hair, the board further believes that the skilled person would not have seen a significant risk in the anti-apoptotic effect that would have deterred them from a cosmetic use on hair.

4.4.5 Furthermore, D14 discloses the use of phytogenic apoptosis inhibitors in general against hair loss (see page 23 lines 13-29) and mentions that these inhibitors can be obtained from peas (see page 5 lines 16-18 and page 6 line 19). Similarly, D15 describes that a combination of phospholipids, which can be obtained from plant extracts (such as pea extracts), has an anti-apoptotic effect (see column 6 line 37). A combating of hair loss is specifically mentioned (see column 14 line 50). The subsequent disclosure of the optimization of the phospholipid combination (referred to as Elirex™) does not negate this general introductory teaching. The board therefore believes that the skilled person would understand from D14 or D15 that pea extracts have the described anti-apoptotic effect.

4.4.6 Finally, it is undisputed that D11 and D14 or D15 focus on different substances contained in the plant extracts (namely extensin in D11 and phospholipids in D14/D15). However, all these documents merely describe plant extracts, i.e., mixtures that may contain these specific substances but also other substances, possibly phospholipids or glycoproteins. In particular, based on the extraction method described in example 4 of D11, it cannot be excluded that amphoteric phospholipids are still present in the raw final preparation. Also, D14 is not, contrary to the respondent's opinion, limited to the use of pure phospholipids (see page 4 lines 30-31 and table 1 on page 30). In the present case, the disclosure of the prior art is to be assessed in relation to that of the contested patent. As already mentioned (see point 4.2.3), neither the contested patent nor the present main request defines specific effective substances within the extract or specific extraction methods. Consequently, the present pea extracts are claimed in a very general manner. Therefore, the patent does not provide a technical contribution to the prior art regarding the characterization of the pea extracts. The presence of an inventive step cannot therefore be based on the substance used. The fact that the modulation of certain proteins claimed in the present main request is not described in D11, D14, and D15 cannot alone lead to the conclusion that this modulation represents a distinguishing feature.

4.4.7 The skilled person would therefore have combined the general teachings regarding the effects of pea extracts from D11 and D14 or D15 unreservedly and without needing any further motivation.

4.4.8 The board is therefore of the opinion that, in light of D14/D15, it would have seemed obvious to the skilled person to test the Pisum sativum extract from D11 against hair loss. The skilled person would thus have arrived at the present subject matter without inventive effort.

4.5 Consequently, the main request does not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC.

4.6 Since the main request does not rely on any inventive step for the reasons stated, the further submissions of the parties based on D16 as the closest prior art are irrelevant.

Admission of Auxiliary Requests VII-IX and XII-XIII

5. Auxiliary Requests VII-IX and XII-XIII differ from the main request mainly in that:

a) additional active ingredients are claimed (Auxiliary Requests VII-IX), or

b) the use has been modified (Auxiliary Requests XII-XIII).

6. According to G 9/92, in the present case, the respondent is primarily limited to defending the patent in the maintained version. According to the principle of prohibition of deterioration, a sole appellant should not be placed in a worse position than without the appeal. Irrelevant or unnecessary amendments can therefore be rejected by the board.

7. In the present case, the aforementioned amendments a) lead to an extension of the scope of protection and are not suitable to overcome the objection of lack of inventive step raised against the main request, as the non-inventive subject matter remains part of the claim. The aforementioned amendments b) lead to a complete change of the factual situation and do not represent an appropriate response to the objection of lack of inventive step of the main request. The amendments made lead to an extension of the scope of protection and thus to a deterioration of the appellant's position and are neither relevant nor necessary.

8. The board finally sees no reason in the present case that could justify an exception to the prohibition of deterioration.

8.1 In this context, the respondent argued that the admission of the aforementioned auxiliary requests was justified in light of the admission of documents D13-D16. The respondent referred to T 1843/09. In this decision, it is stated, among other things, that ""the approach oriented towards considerations of fairness of the Enlarged Board of Appeal applies not only in the case of a misjudgment by the opposition division - as in G 1/99 - but in any change of the factual and/or legal situation, due to which the patent proprietor has made limitations as the sole appellant before the appeal of the opponent, provided that the patent proprietor would be prevented from adequately defending their patent against facts and objections newly introduced into the proceedings at the appeal stage by the prohibition of deterioration"" (see point 2.4.4 of the decision).

8.2 However, the board notes that, even if exceptions to the prohibition of deterioration may be granted in individual cases in light of a later change in circumstances, such exceptions should conform to the principle of fairness. In the present case, the auxiliary requests were already submitted in the first instance proceedings and thus before the introduction of the documents D13-D16 that change the circumstances. As already explained in point 7, the amendments made in the aforementioned auxiliary requests are also neither relevant nor necessary to overcome the objection of lack of inventive step raised against the main request. The board is therefore of the opinion that the aforementioned auxiliary requests do not comply with the principle of fairness. The respondent did not present any arguments regarding the relevance and necessity of the amendments made.

9. Consequently, the board does not admit auxiliary requests VII-IX and XII-XIII into the proceedings because they violate the principle of prohibition of deterioration.

Auxiliary Requests VI, X, and XI

10. Inventive Step

10.1 Auxiliary Requests VI and XI differ from the main request in that the origin of the used substance has been restricted exclusively to Pisum sativum. As already stated regarding the main request, this use does not rely on an inventive step.

10.2 Auxiliary Requests X and XI differ from the main request by the introduction of the feature ""for the protection of the dermal-epidermal junctions of the scalp."" The board is of the opinion that this feature merely represents a rough explanation of the underlying biological mechanism of the claimed effect. The respondent's assertion that this feature would define a new effect has not been substantiated. In particular, the respondent's argument that the anti-protease activity mentioned in paragraph [0019] of the contested patent represents a different mechanism compared to an anti-apoptotic activity cannot be followed. According to the mentioned paragraph, the anti-protease activity is achieved by additional different active ingredients. Furthermore, as already mentioned, a new mechanism can only be considered a distinguishing feature if it leads to a truly different use. The feature introduced in auxiliary requests X and XI cannot therefore represent a limitation of the subject matter of the claim compared to the main request. Recognizing this mechanism does not change the fact that D11, together with D14 or D15, already suggests the claimed uses of Pisum sativum extracts.

10.3 The arguments made for the main request apply mutatis mutandis to auxiliary requests VI, X, and XI. The board thus concludes that the subject matter of auxiliary requests VI, X, and XI does not rely on any inventive step (Article 56 EPC).","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1.

I. The appellant's appeal is directed against the decision of the opposition division to reject his opposition against European Patent EP 2 701 671.

II. The opposition was based on Articles 100(a) and (b) EPC due to lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC), lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC), and lack of sufficiency of disclosure (Article 83 EPC).

In its decision, the opposition division dismissed the grounds for opposition raised. It considered novelty to be present in view of the cited documents, particularly P2. The claimed compositions and methods were described in a manner that was executable and were not suggested to the skilled person either starting from P1 or from P2.

III. The documents relevant to the present decision are:

P1:    WO 99/08649

P2:    EP 2 243 462 A1

P6:    DE 10 2008 020 797 A1

P17:   EP 2 111 851 B1

IV. Independent claim 1 of the contested patent has the following wording:

""pH-stable, free of free fatty acids OW emulsion concentrate for the production of skin cosmetics, comprising

A) in the oil phase

a) 4-12 wt.%, based on the emulsion concentrate, of an emulsifier mixture based on glyceryl stearate citrate, cetearyl alcohol, and glyceryl caprylate,

b) up to 2 wt.%, preferably 0.5-2 wt.%, based on the emulsion concentrate, of a caprylic acid ester,

c) optionally native and/or synthetic cosmetic oils,

d) optionally fatty alcohols with 12-20 carbon atoms,

e) optionally plant butters,

B) in the water phase

a) 2-6 wt.%, based on the emulsion concentrate, of one or more foaming surfactants,

b) optionally moisturizers,

c) lactic acid and/or its salts for adjusting the pH of the emulsion concentrate to 4.5 to 6.""

Independent claim 6 relates to a manufacturing process for the emulsion concentrates defined in claim 1.

Independent claim 7 relates to a skin cosmetic comprising an emulsion concentrate defined in claim 1.

V. In his appeal and during the further course of the appeal proceedings, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

The claimed compositions are not described in an executable manner. In particular, the significance of the features ""pH-stable"" and ""free of free fatty acids"" is not defined; a skilled person would not know how to achieve this in detail. Novelty over P2 is not given. Even if P2 does not disclose novelty-destroying examples, the compositions defined in the claims of the contested patent are not novel in view of the general disclosure of P2. Should novelty be acknowledged, the claimed compositions do not involve an inventive step, as the components of the compositions are already described in P2. Improved properties that could establish an inventive step for the claimed compositions have not been demonstrated. Reference was also made to P6 and P17 for individual features. In case of doubt, an expert should be consulted on technical questions.

Furthermore, the opposition division incorrectly interpreted the content of P2, which justifies a refund of the appeal fee.

VI. In its response to the appeal and during the further course of the appeal proceedings, the respondent essentially argued as follows:

The decision of the opposition division was correct. The claimed compositions are described in an executable manner. In particular, the significance of the features ""pH-stable"" and ""free of free fatty acids"" is clear to the skilled person, and he knows how to produce the claimed compositions. Novelty over P2 is present. There is no disclosure in P2 of compositions that fulfill the claimed features in combination. Starting from P2, the claimed compositions represent an alternative that is not suggested to the skilled person even by consulting further documents. The involvement of an expert is unnecessary.

VII. On October 5, 2020, the board issued a communication under Article 100(2) EPC, informing the parties of the preliminary assessment of the factual and legal situation. The board's preliminary assessment was that the appeal was likely to be dismissed.

VIII. By summons dated April 29, 2021, an oral hearing was scheduled for February 24, 2022.

IX. The oral hearing was conducted as a video conference on February 24, 2022.

The appellant requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the European patent. He further requested that an expert opinion be obtained if there were doubts about his presentation. Additionally, he requested the refund of the appeal fee.

The respondent requested the dismissal of the appeal, alternatively the maintenance of the patent based on auxiliary requests 1-3, submitted on February 23, 2018.

X. At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Sufficiency of Disclosure (Article 83 EPC)

2.1 The independent claims of the contested patent relate to an emulsion concentrate, a method for its production, and a skin cosmetic that comprises such a concentrate.

To comply with Article 83 EPC, a skilled person must be able to produce the claimed compositions after reading the patent document.

The compositions are made from generally available starting materials, and the described manufacturing process does not pose any problems for the skilled person. Furthermore, the patent contains a number of production examples, the feasibility of which has not been disputed. Therefore, the skilled person is indeed capable of producing the claimed emulsions.

2.2 The appellant argues that the two features used in the claim, ""pH-stable"" and ""free of fatty acids,"" are not sufficiently disclosed. A skilled person would not know how to achieve this.

The Board does not follow these arguments.

2.2.1 Regarding the feature ""pH stability,"" the appellant contends that there is a lack of description of the technical measures to produce pH-stable compositions, as well as a definition to distinguish them from pH-unstable compositions.

The first argument is already refuted by the description of the patent, as detailed information and examples are provided on how to produce the claimed compositions. It has neither been claimed nor shown that these are not pH-stable. Stabilization of the pH using a buffer, in this case lactic acid/lactate, is familiar to the skilled person. The Board also does not accept the argument that in the absence of a universally valid definition, this feature can only be understood to mean that the pH of the compositions remains absolutely unchanged under all conditions. This does not correspond to a skilled interpretation of the claims.

The second argument concerns the question of whether a specific composition falls under the claims or not. This is clearly a question of clarity (Article 84 EPC), which is not at issue here.

2.2.2 The feature ""free of fatty acids"" means for the skilled person that free fatty acids are neither added nor formed in the composition.

The appellant has not provided any experimental data showing that the compositions disclosed in the patent, to which no free fatty acids are added, would inevitably contain a measurable concentration of such fatty acids due to hydrolysis. As correctly stated in the contested decision, these are not ideal acidic solutions but O/W emulsions. The fatty acid esters contained in the compositions are therefore not present in the aqueous phase and are not readily accessible to hydrolysis.

2.2.3 The appellant further argued that the lack of feasibility of the two features is particularly evident in comparison with the compositions of the prior art. For example, the compositions of P2 contained no free fatty acids, and no instability of the pH was described there. Therefore, the two features are either meaningless in the claim, or if they are meant to define a difference, the patent lacks guidance on how to realize these features in a way that is not disclosed in P2.

The Board cannot follow this argumentation. Neither the contested decision nor the respondent claims that these features are distinguishing over P2. The features are understandable in themselves, as explained above, and the skilled person knows how to produce corresponding compositions in the specific case. The fact that these features are also realized in the prior art rather supports the notion that the skilled person is not faced with difficulties due to them.

2.3 The conclusion of the opposition division regarding the issue of sufficiency of disclosure in point 2.1 of the contested decision therefore stands.

3. Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

3.1 The contested decision recognized novelty over P2 (see point 2.3.5.1 of the decision).

The Board agrees with the opinion of the opposition division for the reasons set out below. There is no disclosure in P2 that anticipates the claimed features in combination.

3.2 The examples of P2 are not detrimental to novelty, not least because none of the examples contains lactic acid (feature Bc of claim 1). This is undisputed.

3.3 The appellant has argued that the claim features can be derived from the overall content of the disclosure of P2.

The Board does not agree.

3.3.1 First, the Board is not convinced that all the mandatory claimed features are disclosed in P2 as such.

The claim requires the presence of 2-6 wt.% foaming surfactants in the aqueous phase.

The wetting agents mentioned as feature c) in P2 are part of the emulsifier system according to paragraph [0063]. Foaming properties are not disclosed.

Sodium stearoyllactylate, which the appellant believes to be a foaming surfactant, is described in paragraph [0064] as part of an emulsifier system, but without a concentration indication. It is used in examples 3.1 to 3.4, but not in the claimed concentrations. The concentration in examples 3.1 and 3.2 is, as calculated by the parties from the composition of emulsifier 5, 1.92%. In examples 3.3 and 3.4, 1.95% is indicated. Whether this surfactant is present in P2 in the aqueous or oil phase is therefore irrelevant.

3.3.2 Other components of the claimed compositions are described as such, but not in combination with each other.

Lactic acid is mentioned in P2 in paragraph [0042] in a longer list of optional additives.

An emulsifier mixture corresponding to feature Aa is used in examples 1.1 and 1.2 or 2.3 and 2.4, which, however, again do not contain lactic acid or foaming surfactants in the claimed concentration, regardless of how this term is defined.

3.4 There is no disclosure in P2 of the claimed compositions, where the claim features are described in combination. It is indeed correct that a document must be read in light of its entirety. However, this does not mean that a novelty-destroying disclosure can be constructed by subsequently combining technical features that are not described in connection.

Whether the purpose of individual components defined in the claim, such as lactic acid ""for adjusting the pH,"" is limiting or not, or whether they are realized in P2 or not, as discussed extensively by the parties, can therefore remain open for the question of novelty.

4. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

4.1 The contested patent relates to an O/W emulsion concentrate from which various cosmetic formulations can be produced.

4.2 Closest Prior Art

The appellant takes P2 as the closest prior art; this line of argumentation has also been addressed in the contested decision (see points 2.4.3.2 and 2.4.5.3 there).

P2 discloses emulsifier systems that are used in cosmetic formulations. The Board considers the choice of P2 as the closest prior art to be justified, as P2 deals with similar formulations and discloses at least most of the individual claimed components, albeit not in combination (see novelty discussion). P1, which was also discussed in the opposition proceedings, is structurally (different pH, no lactic acid) and in terms of use (skin cream, i.e., end product, not concentrate) further away.

The specific disclosures of P2 that are closest to the claimed invention are examples 1.1 and 1.2 or 2.3 and 2.4, as these use a claimed emulsifier mixture (features Aa or Ab of claim 1).

The claimed emulsion concentrates differ from this at least in the use of lactic acid instead of citric acid to adjust the pH to 4.5-6.

Similarly, the presence of 2-6% foaming surfactants in the aqueous phase constitutes a difference from these embodiments. Such surfactants are not included in the above-mentioned embodiments.

4.3 Problem and Solution

The patent sets out to provide pH-stable O/W emulsion concentrates that do not harm the skin's acid mantle, can be produced from natural raw materials, and can be further processed into various skin cosmetics, see paragraph [0005] of the patent.

Since the raw emulsions produced with the emulsifier systems of P2 essentially solve the same problem, the technical problem to be solved with the patent can be seen as providing alternative such emulsion concentrates. This was undisputed; improvements over P2 were not claimed by the respondent either.

The claimed solution to this problem is the emulsion concentrates of claim 1, characterized in that lactic acid is used to adjust the pH and they contain foaming surfactants in the specified concentration in the aqueous phase.

That the claimed emulsion concentrates solve this problem was undisputed.

4.4 Obviousness of the Solution

It had to be decided whether this solution to the technical problem is suggested to the skilled person by the prior art, as argued by the appellant.

This is not the case, as will be reasoned below.

4.4.1 The use of foaming surfactants in the aqueous phase of such emulsion concentrates in a concentration of 2-6% is not suggested by the documents cited by the appellant.

First, P2 does not mention the generation of foam. A skilled person therefore had no reason to add foaming surfactants to such emulsion concentrates based on D2.

P2 itself mentions ""wetting agents,"" the purpose of which, however, is not to generate foam but to stabilize the emulsion in low concentrations (see, for example, paragraphs [0016] and [0020]). The appellant referred to sodium stearoyllactylate used in examples 3.1-3.4, which he believes can be used for foaming. Even if this were the case, this substance is described in P2 as part of the emulsifier system (see also paragraph [0025]), and is also not present in the claimed concentration.

During the appeal proceedings, the appellant further referred to P17, particularly example 9, in which a spray formulation is used with an emulsion concentrate from example 7. This concentrate, in turn, contains sodium lauryl sarcosinate, which is a surfactant according to the patent.

Regardless of whether, as argued by the respondent, this submission should be rejected as late under Article 13(2) RPBA 2020, it is in any case not suitable to demonstrate the obviousness of the disputed feature. Neither foams are mentioned in P17, nor is sodium lauryl sarcosinate present in the emulsion concentrate of example 7 in the claimed concentration of 2-6% with 11.6%.

4.4.2 The Board is also not convinced that, as claimed by the appellant, adjusting the pH in the emulsion concentrate to 4.5-6 using lactic acid is suggested by the cited documents.

It is indeed correct that P2 mentions lactic acid as an alternative to citric acid in paragraph [0042], but this paragraph refers to the complexing effect for secondary UV protection. As pointed out by the respondent, the use of citric acid for pH adjustment is not described in P2 either in the general part or in the examples. The comparison of, for example, examples 2.1/2.2 and 2.3/2.4, which contain practically identical aqueous phases except for citric acid, also shows that the addition of citric acid has no effect on the pH of the aqueous phase. Citric acid is therefore not used in P2 for pH adjustment.

The Board also does not follow the appellant's argument that the purpose of a substance in a product claim would be irrelevant, so that the disclosure of P2 suggests the use of lactic acid as an alternative to citric acid used in the examples, regardless of the disclosed purpose. This would apply in the context of a novelty consideration, where it only matters whether a specific ingredient is present in a composition or not. In the context of assessing inventive step, however, a targeted action of the skilled person guided by the teaching of the prior art is required, so that the purpose or effect of individual ingredients in a composition indicated in the prior art cannot be completely disregarded.

The appellant referred to P6, which describes the addition of lactic acid for adjusting the pH of a skin cream in paragraph [0036]. However, this concerns the adjustment of the pH in an application product; it is not disclosed that the pH adjustment should already take place in the emulsion concentrate. Moreover, no pH value is indicated.

4.5 The claimed emulsion concentrates can therefore only be assembled from P2 with knowledge of the invention from individual disclosures of the prior art. However, they were not suggested to the skilled person based on P2 from the prior art.

4.6 An inventive step is present. The conclusion of the opposition division in point 2.4 of the contested decision also stands, taking into account the appellant's submissions in the appeal proceedings.

5. Appointment of an Expert

The appellant requested the appointment of an expert to address how surfactants distribute in compositions across the individual phases or at the interface.

Expert opinions are generally admissible evidence under Article 117(1)(e) EPC. However, the Board does not consider the appointment of an expert necessary in the present case (Rule 117 EPC). On the one hand, the question raised by the appellant is not relevant to the decision, as explained in the reasons for the decision above. On the other hand, the Board is sufficiently knowledgeable to understand and evaluate the documents and arguments presented by the appellant.

6. Refund of the Appeal Fee

The appellant requests the refund of the appeal fee, as he believes that the opposition division erroneously failed to recognize the disclosure of glyceryl caprylate in P2.

Any potential refund of the appeal fee is governed by the provisions of Rule 103 EPC.

In particular, a refund of the appeal fee under Rule 101(3)(a) EPC is conditional upon the appeal being allowed. However, this is not the case here.

The provisions of Rules 103(1)(b) and 103(2)-(4) EPC relate to various scenarios in which either the appeal or the request for oral proceedings is withdrawn. This is also not the case here.

According to Rule 103(5) EPC, the enumeration made in Rules 103(1)-(4) EPC is exhaustive. Since none of these cases apply to the present appeal, there is no legal basis for a refund of the appeal fee.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1.

I. The appeals of the patent holder (appellant) and the former opponent concern the decision of the opposition division that the European patent EP-B1-2 662 343 meets the requirements of the EPC in an amended form based on the auxiliary request.

The opposition division decided that the grounds for opposition under Article 100(b) EPC and Article 100(c) EPC did not apply, but that claim 12 as granted was not novel over D6. The former auxiliary request was considered allowable.

II. The following documents cited in the contested decision are relevant here:

D5: Höland, W. et al.; Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A (2003) 361, 575-589

D6: DE 197 50 794 A1

D13A: Post-melting of Ivoclar patent examples

D15: Apel, E.; Journal of the European Ceramic Society 27 (2007), 1571-1577

III. With the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant submitted auxiliary request 1, which is now the sole request.

The relevant claim 12 for the present decision reads as follows:

""12. Use of a lithium silicate glass with seeds suitable for forming lithium metasilicate crystals as the main crystal phase, wherein the glass contains 8.0 to 16.0 wt.-% ZrO2, for the manufacture of dental restorations, wherein the glass is shaped into the desired dental restoration by pressing.""

IV. The opponent withdrew their opposition on December 10, 2018.

V. The oral proceedings took place on May 25, 2020, as a video conference. In this, the appellant made auxiliary request 1 their sole request.

VI. The appellant requests that the contested decision be set aside and that the patent be maintained in an amended form based on the sole request submitted as auxiliary request 1 with the statement of grounds of appeal.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Prohibition of Deterioration (reformatio in peius)

The Opponent has withdrawn their opposition; thus, they are no longer involved in the proceedings regarding the substantive issues (see T 1676/08, Reasons 9.1.2).

According to G 9/92, the Board of Appeal may not question the wording of the patent according to the interim decision to the detriment of the patent holder if they are the sole appellant (prohibition of deterioration).

In the present case, claims 1 to 11 are word-for-word identical to claims 1 to 11 of the auxiliary request, which was deemed sufficient by the Opposition Division in terms of the requirements of the EPC. Therefore, these claims are no longer up for debate (Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 9th edition, 2019, V.A.3.1.5, penultimate paragraph).

2. Claims 15 and 16 were not explicitly addressed in the decision, and nothing was presented during the appeal proceedings, so only claims 12 to 14 are up for debate.

3. Article 76(1) EPC

The conditions of Article 76(1) EPC are fulfilled. Claim 12 derives from a combination of claims 20, 19, 14, and 2 of the parent application (EP 11162840.0). Furthermore, it is evident from the description of the parent application (page 6, lines 15 and 16 in combination with page 8, lines 14 to 16) that the seeds are to be preferably suitable for forming lithium metasilicate crystals as the main crystal phase. Claim 13 is based on claim 16 of the parent application. Claim 20 derives from claim 14 as well as page 8, lines 32 to 34 of the parent application.

4. Article 123(2) EPC

The conditions of Article 123(2) EPC are fulfilled for the following reasons:

Claim 12 directly and unambiguously derives from claim 12 in combination with the disclosure in the description on page 8, lines 9 to 14 and page 4, lines 2 to 5. Claims 13 and 14 correspond to claims 13 and 14 of the application in its originally submitted version.

5. Article 123(3) EPC

The reference in claim 12 of the granted patent to the components defined in one of claims 1 or 4 to 10 of the glass-ceramic is to be interpreted as referring only to the starting components of the starting glass, i.e., only to ZrO2, and not to the weight percentages or the crystal phase. The current claim 12 is restricted compared to claim 12 of the granted patent in that the glass to be used must contain 8.0 to 16.0 wt.-% ZrO2, which was not the case according to the granted claim 12 due to the absence of the weight specification.

The conditions of Article 123(3) EPC are thus fulfilled.

6. Article 83 EPC

The Board agrees with the Opposition Division that the sufficiency of disclosure, in light of the numerous examples in the patent and the absence of counterexamples from the former Opponent, cannot be questioned. The ambiguity in the quantification of the crystal phases is a clarity issue that does not affect the sufficiency of disclosure in the present case.

7. Article 54 EPC

The conditions of Article 54 EPC are fulfilled for the following reasons:

7.1 D5 discloses two embodiments (i) and (ii) (page 579).

The first (i) does not disclose lithium metasilicate, so it does not directly and unambiguously indicate that a glass is present that contains seeds suitable for forming a lithium metasilicate crystal phase. The formation of such seeds requires a specific controlled heat treatment of the starting glass, so that in this glass with seeds, the desired lithium metasilicate crystals can subsequently be formed through another specific heat treatment. There is no indication that the presence of any seeds is suitable for forming lithium metasilicate as the main crystal phase.

The second embodiment (ii) does not disclose zirconium.

7.2 D6 discloses in Example 22 the production of a dental product by computer-controlled milling technology. The starting glass has the composition specified for Example 7 (Table I) and thus does not contain zirconium. The experiments shown in D13A concerning Example 17 and Example 17 with 8 wt.-% ZrO2, which are supposed to be based on procedural details from Example 22, are not present in D6 and therefore cannot be considered as a reworking of an experiment from the prior art. Furthermore, an embodiment represents a self-contained, specific embodiment (T 210/05, Reasons 2.3), which cannot be combined with other details from the description. The Board therefore does not agree with the Opposition Division, as the relevance of a document for the question of novelty is not determined based on probabilities (T 464/94, Reasons 16). A glass with seeds suitable for forming lithium metasilicate crystals as the main crystal phase, where the glass contains 8.0 to 16.0 wt.-% ZrO2, does not therefore directly and unambiguously emerge from D6.

8. Article 56 EPC

8.1 The invention relates to the use of lithium silicate glass containing ZrO2 for the production of dental restorations (paragraph [0001]).

8.2 Of the documents mentioned in the appeal proceedings, D15 is the closest prior art. It discloses in Table 1 a starting glass 4 containing 4.05 wt.-% ZrO2. After the first crystallization step, lithium metasilicate is the main crystal phase (page 1573, right column, last sentence). The glass-ceramics are used for the production of dental restorations (introduction, third sentence).

8.3 The problem to be solved consists of using a glass that allows for providing a glass-ceramic that can be layered in a viscous state onto a zirconia ceramic and forms a coating that is essentially free of cracks and chips (paragraph [0010]).

8.4 The problem is solved by using a glass according to claim 12 characterized in that the glass contains 8.0 to 16.0 wt.-% ZrO2.

8.5 The problem is considered to be successfully solved. Although the data from Table 3 of D15 already indicate high strength, there are no indications of how the behavior of this glass-ceramic during layering is represented. There are also no indications in the form of experiments that would call into question the successful solution of the problem.

8.6 The solution is not suggested for the following reasons:

D15 does not disclose the properties during layering onto a ceramic and gives no indication to choose ZrO2 in the range of 8.0 to 16.0 wt.-%.

D6 does not concern glasses that contain seeds for forming a lithium metasilicate crystal phase. Furthermore, the exemplary starting glasses shown in Table 1 contain a maximum of 6.1 wt.-% ZrO2.

Also, D9 does not concern glass-ceramics with lithium metasilicate as the main crystal phase, so consequently, no glass with seeds suitable for forming such is taught. There is also no clear teaching to choose ZrO2 in the range of 8.0 to 16.0 wt.-%, as the preferred range is 16 to 25 wt.-% (claim 2).

8.7 The subject matter of claim 12 thus involves an inventive step. This also applies to dependent claims 13 and 14.

8.8 The conditions of Article 56 EPC are thus fulfilled.

9. Adaptation of the Description

The only change compared to the granted patent occurred in claim 12. This change does not require an adaptation of the description, as it is already reflected in paragraph [0037].","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1.

I. The appeal of the applicant (appellant) is directed against the decision of the examining division to refuse European patent application No. 09 158 328.6.

II. The examining division justified the refusal of the application on the grounds that the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request as well as the two auxiliary requests before it did not involve an inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA 2020, the Board expressed its preliminary opinion, among other things, that the subject matter of claim 1 of all pending claim sets, starting from document D6 as the closest prior art, did not involve an inventive step. The Board introduced two new documents (D10 and D11; bibliographic data, see below) into the proceedings.

VIII. The relevant written and oral submissions of the appellant can be summarized as follows:

Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

Main Request - Claim 1

Considering document D6 as the closest prior art in accordance with the Board's preliminary written opinion, the subject matter of claim 1 differs from the relevant disclosure of this document in two technical features. Firstly, document D6 describes a pH value of 4 for the G-CSF-containing Neupogen® formulation, while the claimed pH value lies in the range of 4.1 to 4.3. Secondly, document D6 does not specify which compound is used to adjust the pH value, whereas the claim specifies that the pH value is adjusted with NaOH.

The technical problem to be solved lies in providing an alternative G-CSF liquid formulation.

pH value in the range of 4.1 to 4.3

Document D6 discloses on page 322, paragraph 3.1, that natural G-CSF is quite stable under physiological conditions and that Neupogen® aggregates at pH values above 5 and simultaneously elevated temperatures, regardless of whether 5% mannitol or 150 mM NaCl are added as tonicity-affecting substances.

Minimal aggregation of Neupogen® is found at a pH value of 4 in the presence of 5% mannitol.

The skilled person interprets the indication ""pH 4"" in section 3.1 on page 322 as ""pH 4.0"" in light of the description in paragraph 3.3 on page 323 of document D6. It is mentioned there that other buffer systems with a buffering capacity in a pH range of ""pH 4 ± 0.5"" do not completely eliminate aggregation.

The pH value of 4 has been used for the formulation of Neupogen® for 20 years. Given the disclosures in sections 3.1 and 4.0 of document D6, which describe that G-CSF or Neupogen® is extremely stable at this pH value, the skilled person had no reason to deviate from this optimal and established value.

Document D8 provides experimental stress test data in Table 1 on page 5, showing that a pH value of less than 4.0 leads to improved stability of G-CSF. Thus, the teaching of document D8 does not encourage the skilled person to use a pH value greater than 4.0.

However, it was also known that a pH value that is too acidic could be problematic for the compatibility of injection solutions. Therefore, the skilled person would not have considered pH values below 4.0.

Ultimately, the skilled person would not have deviated from the established pH value of 4.0.

Document D7 describes on page 1455, left column, line 28 that a commercially available G-CSF injection solution is stable in a range between pH 3.8 to 4.2. However, the skilled person would not trust this disclosure, as document D7 is not scientific literature and the pH indication is made without a literature reference. Furthermore, such a broad pH range for a commercial G-CSF formulation is implausible due to its width.

Adjustment of the pH value with NaOH

Even if the technical problem is merely the provision of an alternative liquid formulation for G-CSF, the claimed solution must at least be obvious from the prior art to be considered non-inventive. Document D6 does not disclose any pH adjustment. The skilled person knows that the pH can be adjusted in many ways and therefore is not necessarily adjusted with NaOH.

Auxiliary Request 1 - Claim 1

In the written proceedings, the appellant argued regarding claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 that the claim feature ""for filling a pre-filled syringe"" should be understood as a functional feature that excludes filling other containers from the claim wording. Only the specific composition of the claimed G-CSF liquid formulation and its stability at a pH value of 4.1 to 4.3 allows it to be used for filling pre-filled syringes.

Moreover, the syringes described in document D7 are not pre-filled syringes in the sense of the claim.

Furthermore, document D7 does not describe a storage-stable G-CSF liquid formulation.

During the oral proceedings, the appellant refrained from developing a separate problem-solution approach based on document D6 as the closest prior art for auxiliary request 1.

Auxiliary Request 2 - Claim 1

In the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant argued that the active ingredient concentration plays a crucial role in the stability of a protein solution. It cannot simply be assumed that double the amount of protein in the same pH range is as stable as half the amount. It is common knowledge that concentrated proteins have increased instabilities and are more prone to aggregation.

The teaching of document D7 provides no insight into what composition could enable the stabilization of 0.6 mg/ml G-CSF. However, paragraph 2 on page 15 and figures 1 and 2 of the present application show a positive long-term stabilization of the claimed 0.6 mg/ml G-CSF-containing liquid formulations at temperatures of 30°C and 40°C over a period of 6 months.

During the oral proceedings, the appellant refrained from developing a separate problem-solution approach based on document D6 as the closest prior art for auxiliary request 2.

Auxiliary Requests 3 and 4 - Claim 1

In the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant referred to the arguments presented for auxiliary requests 1 and 2 regarding auxiliary requests 3 and 4. Starting from document D7, the skilled person would therefore not arrive in an obvious manner at the claimed liquid formulation for filling pre-filled syringes or for use as a medicinal product.

For auxiliary requests 3 and 4, the appellant also refrained during the oral proceedings from developing a separate problem-solution approach based on document D6 as the closest prior art.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible as the requirements of Articles 106 to 108 EPC and Rule 99 EPC are met.

Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

Main Request - Claim 1

2. The Board considers document D6 to represent the closest prior art. Document D6 is a chapter from the book ""Formulation, Characterization and Stability of Protein Drugs."" The chapter deals with the characterization, formulation, and stability of ""Neupogen®.""

On page 322, section 3.1 reveals that the active ingredient in the product Neupogen® (""Filgrastim""; a human, recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) produced in E. coli; see document D6, page 304, first paragraph) contains a high proportion of hydrophobic amino acids. The carbohydrate chains present in natural G-CSF mask some of this hydrophobicity. Therefore, special considerations had to be made to obtain a long-term stable formulation for the product produced in E. coli - and thus aglycosylated. Furthermore, document D6 reports in chapter 3.1 that, although natural G-CSF is quite stable under physiological conditions, Neupogen® aggregates at pH values above 5 when tested at elevated temperatures.

The marketed Neupogen® liquid formulation with a G-CSF concentration of 300 myg/ml is stable at 2 to 8 °C for more than 24 months (see page 322, chapter 3 ""FORMULATION""). This Neupogen® liquid formulation has a pH of 4 and contains, in addition to G-CSF, 10 mM sodium acetate, 5% mannitol, and 0.004% polysorbate-80 (see page 322, section 3.1).

On page 323, section 3.3, it is stated that mannitol is currently being replaced by sorbitol in the Neupogen® formulation (""Presently, sorbitol is being substituted for mannitol in the formulation of Neupogen®"").

Distinct Technical Features

3. As also presented by the appellant during the oral proceedings, the subject matter of claim 1 differs from the Neupogen® liquid formulation described in document D6 in two respects:

i) in the pH value, which is claimed to be between 4.1 and 4.3, while the pH of Neupogen® is 4.0; ii) regarding the means by which the pH is adjusted, which is claimed to be NaOH, while the means by which the pH of the Neupogen® formulation is adjusted is not described in document D6.

Technical Effect of the Differences

4. The present application does not include data showing a comparison of properties of the claimed liquid formulation with that from the closest prior art.

However, on page 15, lines 2 to 5, it is stated:

""The formulations according to the invention were stored at various temperatures over different time periods together with corresponding formulations with a pH of 4.0, which represent the prior art and served as a comparative formulation."" The result of the comparison is described at the bottom of page 15 as follows: ""Overall, the formulations according to the invention showed comparable results to the comparative formulation, which differed only by a more acidic pH value, namely pH 4.0, from the tested formulations according to the invention."" (Emphasis by the Board).

Technical Problem to be Solved

5. The Board therefore agrees with the appellant that the technical problem to be solved compared to the closest prior art is to provide an alternative G-CSF-containing liquid formulation.

Obviousness of the Solution

6. Starting from the closest prior art, the question arises as to whether the skilled person would have chosen a pH range between 4.1 and 4.3 for G-CSF-containing liquid formulations and whether the skilled person would have adjusted the pH using NaOH.

7. Faced with the problem of providing an alternative G-CSF-containing liquid formulation, the skilled person would select and modify any of the characteristics that define the Neupogen® formulation, such as the pH value or the means for adjusting the pH.

pH Value in the Range of 4.1 to 4.3

8. The skilled person is aware that the commercially available G-CSF-containing liquid formulation Neupogen® has been stable for a long time and has a pH of 4.0. Document D6 further informs the skilled person that Neupogen® aggregates at pH values above 5 when tested at elevated temperatures.

Finally, the skilled person knows, as stated by the appellant, about the generally known issue of lower patient tolerance for injection solutions with lower pH values.

Therefore, the skilled person would not have chosen a pH value above 5 or below 4 for the alternative liquid formulation.

9. Working in the pH range above 4 and below 5, i.e., between 4 and 5, was therefore obvious. The Board considers it equally obvious to choose a range just above the pH value of 4 - at which Neupogen® is stable - so that no effects negatively impacting the stability of the protein to be formulated were expected. The selection of the pH range between 4.1 and 4.3 from the range between 4 and 5 (and not, for example, the range between 4.1 and 4.2) is viewed by the Board as arbitrary. This means that its selection was not targeted, i.e., not made to achieve a specific effect. The appellant has not claimed otherwise.

10. Instead, the appellant argues that the skilled person, in light of document D8, would not have considered using a pH value between 4.1 and 4.3 for the formulation. Document D8 shows, namely in Table 1 on page 5, that G-CSF aggregates relatively strongly at pH 4.2 when stored for two weeks at 52°C.

11. The Board is not convinced by this argument. On the one hand, the G-CSF-containing formulation tested in document D8 differs from the claimed G-CSF formulation in that it contains 5% mannitol, no polysorbate, and no buffering system, whereas the claimed formulation contains sorbitol and polysorbate-20 and an acetate buffer. The skilled person is aware that these components can influence the stability of the protein.

On the other hand, document D8 describes that no aggregation occurs at a two-week incubation period at 42 °C, i.e., at a lower temperature.

In the Board's view, the teaching of document D8 would therefore not have deterred the skilled person from working in the claimed pH range.

12. The Board thus concludes that the skilled person, based on the teaching of document D6 and general knowledge, would have chosen the claimed pH range without having to engage in inventive activity.

13. Therefore, there is no need to address the credibility of the disclosure in document D7, which states that a commercially available filgrastim injection solution is stable in a pH range between 3.8 and 4.2.

Adjustment of the pH Using NaOH

14. The appellant argues that document D6 does not disclose how the pH is adjusted, but that the skilled person knows that this can be done in various ways and therefore does not necessarily have to be done with NaOH as claimed.

15. The skilled person knows that there are a number of equivalent alternative means by which the pH can be adjusted. That NaOH is such a known means for pH adjustment is beyond doubt.

16. As with the selection of the pH range (see points 8 to 9), the Board also considers the choice of NaOH for adjusting the pH to be an arbitrary selection. This means that this means was not selected purposefully, i.e., not to achieve a specific effect. The appellant has not claimed otherwise.

17. The Board therefore concludes that the choice of NaOH as a means for adjusting the pH was made without the skilled person having to engage in inventive activity.

18. Consequently, the Board is of the opinion that claim 1 of the main request does not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC.

Auxiliary Request 1 - Claim 1

19. The question arising in the context of auxiliary request 1 is whether it required an inventive step to use the product according to claim 1 of the main request - which has been denied inventive step, see points 7 to 18 above - to bring it into a specific dosage form, i.e., to use it for filling a pre-filled syringe.

This is to be denied. The use of G-CSF liquid formulations for filling pre-filled syringes was part of the general knowledge as evidenced by documents D10 or D11.

20. Document D10 discloses on page 30, in a package leaflet from Amgen dated 2000, the commercial product Neupogen® - which is also described in document D6 - as an ingredient of a pre-filled syringe at a concentration or volume of 300 myg/0.5 ml or 480 myg/0.8 ml.

Similarly, document D11 discloses under entry number 51 035 the specifications for Neupogen® from Amgen in the form of a pre-filled syringe with a concentration of 300 myg/0.5 ml or 480 myg/0.8 ml.

21. In the Board's view, therefore, the claimed use is suggested by the teaching of the closest prior art document D6 in combination with the general knowledge represented by documents D10 and D11.

22. Therefore, auxiliary request 1 also does not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC.

Auxiliary Request 2 - Claim 1

23. Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 defines the liquid formulation compared to claim 1 of the main request by the additional feature that the ""concentration of G-CSF is 0.6 mg/ml"" (i.e., 600 myg/ml).

24. The question therefore arises whether the formulation of the non-inventive product according to claim 1 of the main request in this concentration can constitute an inventive step.

25. As mentioned above in point 20, documents D10 and D11 disclose the product Neupogen® as an ingredient of pre-filled syringes in two different concentrations: 300 myg/0.5 ml or 480 myg/0.8 ml. Both of these values correspond to the claimed concentration of 0.6 mg/ml when converted.

The claimed concentration is therefore a concentration known for the product Neupogen® described in document D6, and its selection does not require inventive activity.

26. In light of this disclosure, the Board concludes that the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 does not fulfill the requirements of Article 56 EPC.

Auxiliary Requests 3 and 4 - Claim 1

27. Compared to auxiliary requests 1 and 2, auxiliary requests 3 and 4 include the additional requirement that in the claimed G-CSF liquid formulation ""the content of active G-CSF molecules after three months of storage of the G-CSF liquid formulation at 25°C is 80% or more of the initial concentration.""

28. However, this requirement was already met by Neupogen®, as evident from document D6. Chapter 4.1, ""Aggregation Analysis,"" starting on page 323, reveals that Neupogen® only exceeds the required specification of no more than 1% aggregated total protein after 6 to 8 months at 29 °C. At 2 to 8 °C, this value is not reached until after 36 months.

Therefore, the parameter added to auxiliary requests 3 and 4 cannot be seen as a technical distinguishing feature and thus cannot contribute to inventive activity.

29. Thus, the subject matter of each claim 1 of auxiliary requests 3 and 4 does not rest on an inventive step for the same reasons as those of auxiliary requests 1 and 2.

Consequently, both auxiliary requests do not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",the application has been refused,the application has been refused,appeal dismissed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

II. An opposition was filed against the grant of the patent. The grounds for opposition included lack of novelty and lack of inventive step (Article 100 a) EPC), insufficient disclosure (Article 100 b) EPC), and impermissible extension of content (Article 100 c) EPC).

III. The Opposition Division decided to revoke the patent. This decision was based on the granted patent as the main request and 22 auxiliary requests submitted on September 9, 2016, as well as an auxiliary request submitted during the oral proceedings on November 11, 2016.

IV. The following documents were cited inter alia in the decision of the Opposition Division:

D2: EP 0 436 110 A1

D3a: TW 310277

D3b: Translation of D3a

V. The Opposition Division stated in its decision, in particular, the following:

a) The main request and auxiliary requests 1-4 did not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

b) Auxiliary request 5 did not meet the requirements of Article 83 EPC, as the skilled person could not derive a method for producing droplet-shaped pellets without coating from either their general knowledge or the contested patent.

c) Auxiliary request 6 was unclear.

d) The subject matter of auxiliary request 6b was not inventive over D2, as both documents already taught to exclude binders and auxiliary substances and to achieve a low water content.

e) Auxiliary requests 7-22 did not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC for the same reasons as stated for auxiliary request 6b, as the subject matter in these auxiliary requests had not changed substantially.

VI. The patent proprietor (appellant) filed an appeal against the above decision.

With the statement of grounds of appeal dated October 24, 2018, the appellant submitted 22 auxiliary requests.

The content of the claims on which the present decision is based is as follows:

The auxiliary request 12 submitted on October 24, 2018 differed from the main request (patent as granted) in that:

- the claims for products characterized by a method for their production (i.e., claims 3-9) were deleted, and

- the conjunction ""or"" in claim 1 was either replaced by the conjunction ""and"" (see 1st paragraph) or deleted (see process steps a6.) and a7.)).

VII. An oral hearing took place before the Board on July 15, 2021. As announced in a letter dated July 9, 2021, the respondent (opponent) did not participate in the hearing. During the oral proceedings, the appellant made auxiliary request 12 submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal dated October 24, 2018 the main request and requested the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent based on auxiliary request 12 submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal.

VIII. The respondent (opponent) requested the dismissal of the appeal.

IX. The relevant arguments of the appellant for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) The claims of the main request were based on the original application and thus met the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

b) The main request was sufficiently disclosed. In particular, it was possible for the skilled person to produce droplet-shaped pellets according to the present claim based on process step a6.) and possibly general knowledge.

c) The claimed process steps could not be implicitly derived from D2 to arrive at the present method for producing pellets consisting solely of pancreatin.

X. The respondent did not provide detailed arguments regarding the process claims to which the new main request is limited during the appeal proceedings. However, the arguments presented in the statement of grounds of appeal regarding the granted patent are at least partially applicable to the present main request. These can be summarized as follows:

a) As stated in the first-instance decision, the requirements of Articles 123(2) and 83 EPC are not met.

b) In the absence of any advantageous properties of the present pancreatin pellets substantiated by experimental data, it is questionable whether an invention is present at all.","Reasons for the Decision

Main Request

1. Amendments

1.1 Article 123(2) EPC

1.1.1 Claim 1 is based on original Claim 13, wherein the feature ""having a spherical or ellipsoidal shape, with the sphere diameter or the short axis in the range of 0.4 to 0.8 mm or having a droplet shape"" has been introduced.

A description of the production of droplet-shaped pellets without size specification can be found in the original page 5, first paragraph. The entire paragraph (from page 4) describes all procedural steps and features of Claim 1 and thus provides a suitable basis for the aforementioned amendment.

1.1.2 The objection raised in the first-instance decision regarding the alleged exclusion of excipients or binders is no longer relevant, as the conjunction ""and"" is now used. This formulation is based inter alia on original Claim 1.

1.1.3 The fulfillment of the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC for the further amendments made in the present Claim 1 was neither criticized in the first-instance decision nor by the respondent in the appeal proceedings. In this context, it is noted that the respondent's merely general reference to the submissions from the opposition proceedings (see Respondent's Response points 10 and 11) is not sufficiently substantiated. The present Claim 2 was also not contested in this context during the appeal proceedings. The Board sees no reason to deviate from this.

1.2 Article 123(3) EPC

1.2.1 The respondent did not raise any objection regarding the non-fulfillment of the requirements of Article 123(3) EPC for the present main request during the appeal proceedings.

1.2.2 The Board is of the opinion that the wording ""pellets or micropellets consisting of 100% pancreatin without excipients or binders"" in granted Claim 1 includes the exclusion of both substances (i.e., neither excipients nor binders can be included). Consequently, the replacement of the conjunction ""or"" with the conjunction ""and"" in the present case does not change the scope of protection. The further amendments compared to the granted claims narrow the scope of protection.

1.3 The Board thus concludes that the claims of the main request meet the requirements of Articles 123(2) and (3) EPC.

2. Sufficient Disclosure

2.1 In its decision, the opposition division criticized that the patent does not contain a teaching regarding the production of a droplet-shaped pellet without coating. Such a method cannot further be derived from the common knowledge of the skilled person. The respondent did not provide detailed arguments regarding the issue of sufficient disclosure during the appeal proceedings. As mentioned in point 1.1.3, the merely general reference to the submissions from the opposition proceedings (see Respondent's Response points 10 and 11) is not sufficiently substantiated.

2.2 The skilled person learns from the patent that after procedural step a6), a plastic mass is obtained (see Claim 1 as granted). A direct processing of the said mass (similar to kneading) in any form thus appears obvious even to non-experts. In the absence of contrary indications, known methods, such as pressing the said mass, are also considered suitable for shaping it into droplets. Finally, the Board notes that in paragraph [0019] of the contested patent, the production of uncoated droplet-shaped pellets by spheronization is generally described. In the absence of serious doubts substantiated by verifiable facts, the Board is of the opinion that the contested method is sufficiently disclosed.

2.3 The main request therefore meets the requirements of Article 83 EPC.

3. Novelty

3.1 The respondent raised an objection of lack of novelty against the products claimed in the granted patent. However, the present main request now contains no product claims but only process claims. The novelty of these claims was not contested by the respondent. The present procedural steps of Claims 1-2 of the main request are not disclosed in any of the cited documents.

3.2 The Board is therefore of the opinion that the subject matter of the claims of the main request meets the requirements of Article 54 EPC.

4. Inventive Step

4.1 D2 was preferred as the closest prior art in the first-instance decision and by both parties in the appeal proceedings. The Board sees no reason to deviate from this. D2 relates to the production of pancreatin particles without binders or excipients with a high enzyme content.

4.2 The first-instance decision merely stated in general terms that the auxiliary requests were not inventive for the same reasons as those given for the auxiliary request 6 underlying the said decision. However, the Board notes that the present main request has been limited to process claims. The claimed process differs from the process described in D2 by several specific procedural steps (inter alia filtration, heat treatment, and extrusion). These distinguishing features were not considered in the opposition division's reasoning regarding the said auxiliary request, as that reasoning concerned the inventive step of the product. The respondent also did not provide arguments regarding the process claims during the appeal proceedings. In this context, it is noted that the merely general reference to the submissions from the opposition proceedings (see Respondent's Response points 4 and 11) is not sufficiently substantiated. Thus, there are no suitably reasoned objections regarding the lack of inventive step for the claimed subject matter. The Board further sees no indications to conclude that starting from D2, the claimed combination of these process steps would have been obvious to the skilled person in order to provide another method for producing 100%-pancreatin-containing pellets with low residual moisture. The same conclusion would arise starting from D3a as the closest prior art.

4.3 The main request is therefore considered inventive (Article 56 EPC).","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2. The matter is referred back to the opposition division with the order to maintain the patent on the basis of the claims of the former auxiliary request 12 (now the main request) and a description that may need to be adjusted accordingly.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,decision under appeal is set aside,"Murray, Adrian D'Coligny","Murray, Adrian D'Coligny Pinsent Masons LLP 30 Crown Place Earl Street London EC2A 4ES / GB","Sharp, Christopher William Pinsent Masons LLP 30 Crown Place Earl Street London EC2A 4ES / GB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeals of the patent holder (appellant) and the former opponent concern the decision of the opposition division that the European patent EP-B1-2 664 594 meets the requirements of the EPC in an amended form based on auxiliary request 1.

The opposition division decided that the grounds for opposition under Article 100(b) EPC and Article 100(c) EPC did not apply, but that claim 1 as granted was not novel over D6 and claim 12 as granted was not novel over D9. The then auxiliary request 1 was considered allowable.

II. The following documents cited in the contested decision are relevant here.

D5: Höland, W. et al.; Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A (2003) 361, 575-589

D6: DE 197 50 794 A1

D9: EP 0 690 031 A1

D21: US 2003/0073563 A1

III. With the statement of appeal, the appellant submitted, among other things, an auxiliary request 1A, which is now the sole request.

The independent claim 1 relevant to the present decision, which corresponds to the granted claim 1, and the independent claim 12 read as follows:

""1. Use of a lithium silicate glass-ceramic containing 8.0 to 16.0 wt.% ZrO2 and having lithium metasilicate or lithium disilicate as the main crystal phase for coating dental restorations and in particular for coating zirconium oxide ceramics.""

""12. Use of a lithium silicate glass with seeds suitable for forming lithium metasilicate or lithium disilicate crystals as the main crystal phase, wherein the glass contains 8.0 to 16.0 wt.% ZrO2, for coating dental restorations and in particular for coating zirconium oxide ceramics.""

IV. The opponent withdrew their opposition on December 10, 2018.

V. The oral proceedings took place on May 25, 2020, as a video conference. In this, the appellant made auxiliary request 1A their sole request.

VI. The appellant requests that the contested decision be overturned and that the patent be maintained in an amended form based on the sole request submitted as auxiliary request 1A with the statement of appeal.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Claims 14 to 16 were not explicitly addressed in the decision and nothing was presented in the appeal proceedings, so only claims 1 to 13 are under discussion.

2. Article 100(c) EPC in conjunction with Article 76(1) EPC

The conditions of Article 76(1) EPC are fulfilled. Claim 1 arises directly and unambiguously from the combination of claims 19, 18, and 2 to 4 of the parent application (EP 11162840.0). The subject matter of claims 2 to 11 is based on claims 3-4 and 7 to 13 of the parent application. Claim 12 arises from a combination of claims 19, 18, 14, and 2. Furthermore, it is evident from the description of the parent application (page 6, lines 15, 16, 22, and 23 in combination with page 8, lines 14 to 16) that the seeds are to be preferably suitable for forming lithium metasilicate or lithium disilicate crystals as the main crystal phase. Claim 13 arises from claim 16 of the parent application.

3. Article 100(c) EPC in conjunction with Article 123(2) EPC

The conditions of Article 123(2) EPC are fulfilled for the following reasons:

Claims 1 to 11 and 13 correspond to claims 1 to 11 and 13 of the application as originally filed. Claim 12 arises directly and unambiguously from claim 12 in combination with the disclosure in the description on page 8, lines 9 to 14 and page 4, lines 2 to 5.

4. Article 123(3) EPC

The only amended claim compared to the granted patent is claim 12. The reference in claim 12 of the granted patent to the components defined in one of claims 1 or 4 to 10 of the glass-ceramic is to be interpreted as referring only to the starting components of the starting glass, namely only to ZrO2, and not to the weight specifications or the crystal phase. Claim 12 is now restricted compared to claim 12 of the granted patent in that the glass to be used must contain 8.0 to 16.0 wt.-% ZrO2, which was not the case according to the granted claim 12 due to the lack of weight specification.

The conditions of Article 123(3) EPC are thus fulfilled.

5. Article 100(b) EPC

The Board agrees with the Opposition Division that the enablement, in light of the numerous examples in the patent and the absence of counterexamples from the former opponent, cannot be questioned. The ambiguity in the quantification of the crystal phases is a clarity issue that does not concern enablement in the present case.

The experimental results submitted in the appeal by the former opponent do not relate to glass-ceramics according to the patent and are therefore not relevant for the enablement of the present patent.

6. Article 100(a) EPC in conjunction with Article 54 EPC

The novelty objections of the Opposition Division against claims 1 and 12 cannot be agreed with for the following reasons:

6.1 D9 does not describe a glass-ceramic that has lithium metasilicate or lithium disilicate as the main crystal phase. Instead, it is supposed to have a ZrO2 crystal phase and another crystal phase, such as lithium phosphate (claims 1 and 5 as well as Table II). Therefore, it cannot be concluded that a glass is described that contains seeds suitable for forming lithium metasilicate or lithium disilicate as the main crystal phase. The formation of such seeds requires a specific controlled heat treatment of the starting glass, so that in this glass with seeds, the desired lithium metasilicate or lithium disilicate crystals can subsequently be formed through another specific heat treatment. There is no disclosure that the presence of any seeds would be suitable for forming lithium metasilicate or lithium disilicate as the main crystal phase.

6.2 Even if it is assumed that the boundary of the wt.-% content of ZrO2 is to be considered explicitly disclosed (see T 500/11, reasons 2.4), D6 does not disclose directly and unambiguously that the lithium disilicate glass-ceramic shown there is used for coating dental restorations. The disclosure on page 5 (lines 66 to 68) that preferred shaped dental products are dental restorations, such as an inlay, an onlay, a bridge, a post build-up, a veneer, a facet, a crown, or a partial crown, does not lead to the conclusion that it necessarily involves a coating. Although the described dental restorations may contain coatings, such a coating is not disclosed directly and unambiguously there.

6.3 The novelty objection based on D5 was not further presented by the former opponent in the appeal proceedings.

7. Article 100(a) EPC in conjunction with Article 56 EPC

7.1 Claim 1

7.1.1 The invention relates to the use of lithium silicate glass containing ZrO2 for the manufacture of dental restorations (paragraph [0001]).

7.1.2 D6 is considered the closest prior art, as it discloses shaped dental products such as an inlay, an onlay, a bridge, a post build-up, a veneer, a facet, a crown, or a partial crown, which consist of a lithium disilicate glass-ceramic that may contain up to 10 wt.-% ZrO2 (claims 1, 9, and 18).

7.1.3 The problem to be solved is to modify the surface of the dental restoration, whereby a coating that is essentially free of cracks and chips is formed (see paragraphs [0003] and [0010]).

7.1.4 The problem is solved by the use according to claim 1, characterized in that the glass-ceramic is used for coating dental restorations.

7.1.5 There is no reason to doubt that the problem is successfully solved.

7.1.6 The solution does not appear to be obvious for the following reasons:

D6 does not disclose that the described translucent lithium disilicate glass-ceramic can also be used for coating dental restorations. In the disclosed example, the glass-ceramic blanks are processed into dental ceramic restorations. It does not emerge that this glass-ceramic would also be suitable for being applied to another restoration, and that a coating free of cracks and chips would be formed in the process. Moreover, the example glass compositions shown in Table 1 contain a maximum of 6.1 wt.-% ZrO2.

D21 does not clearly disclose that the lithium disilicate glass-ceramics can coat the surface of dental restorations. Furthermore, the compositions used in Example 2, 2, 6, 8, and 9 do not contain zirconium. Although compositions containing up to 3% zirconium are disclosed in D21 (Table 1), there is no indication that a glass-ceramic containing 8 to 16 wt.-% ZrO2, thus significantly more than the amount disclosed in D21, can successfully solve the formulated problem.

As described in point 6.2, D9 does not disclose a glass-ceramic that contains lithium disilicate or lithium metasilicate. Furthermore, D9 does not deal with the coating of dental restorations.

7.1.7 The subject matter of claim 1 and dependent claims 2 to 11 thus involves an inventive step.

7.2 Claim 12

The arguments presented for claim 1 also apply here, as the glass must contain seeds that are suitable for forming lithium metasilicate or lithium disilicate crystals as the main crystal phase. The glass thus represents a precursor of the glass-ceramic used in claims 1 to 11. As stated above (point 6.1), it cannot simply be assumed that the presence of any seeds would be suitable for forming lithium metasilicate or lithium disilicate as the main crystal phase.

The subject matter of claim 12 and dependent claim 13 also involves an inventive step.

7.3 The conditions of Article 56 EPC are fulfilled.

8. Adaptation of the Description

The only change compared to the granted patent occurred in claim 12. This change does not require an adaptation of the description, as it is already reflected in paragraph [0037].","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2. The case is referred back to the opposition division with the order to maintain the patent in amended form based on the sole request (submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal as auxiliary request 1A) and the description and figures of the patent as granted.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,decision under appeal is set aside,Vita Zahnfabrik H.

I. The appellant (patent holder) filed an appeal against the decision of the opposition division to revoke the patent EP 2 413 710.

II. The opponent requested the revocation of the patent in its entirety, particularly based on the grounds for opposition under Article 100 a) EPC (lack of novelty and lack of inventive step and exclusion under Article 52(2)(a) EPC), Article 100 b) EPC, and Article 100 c) EPC.

III. Claim 1 of the patent as granted reads as follows:

""Ready-to-use, stable suspension of partially amorphous beta-carotene particles, comprising:

1 to 20 wt.-% beta-carotene,

0.2 to 20 wt.-% an edible oil,

3 to 60 wt.-% octenyl succinate starch as a hydrophilic protective colloid,

5 to 60 wt.-% a physiologically acceptable polyol, and

5 to 60 wt.-% water,

wherein the wt.-% values refer to the ready-to-use, stable suspension, the sum of the shares of beta-carotene, the edible oil, the octenyl succinate starch, the physiologically acceptable polyol, and the water together amounts to at least 80 wt.-%, and the weight ratio between beta-carotene and edible oil ranges from 1:0.01 to 1:2.""

IV. The opposition division decided, among other things, that the subject matter of claims 1 to 4 and 8 to 13 of the patent as granted was not novel in view of D2, and that the subject matter of claims 1, 2, and 4 of the patent as granted did not involve an inventive step in view of D4 as the closest prior art.

V. With the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant submitted a main request and auxiliary request 1.

Claim 1 of the main request (a combination of claims 1 and 5 of the patent as granted) relates to a ready-to-use, stable suspension of partially amorphous ß-carotene particles comprising,

3 to 10 wt.-% ß-carotene,

1 to 5 wt.-% medium-chain triglyceride as an edible oil,

0.5 to 2.0 wt.-% d,l-alpha-tocopherol,

10 to 24 wt.-% octenyl succinate starch as a hydrophilic protective colloid,

30 to 40 wt.-% glycerin as a physiologically acceptable polyol, and

30 to 40 wt.-% water,

wherein the wt.-% values refer to the ready-to-use, stable suspension, the sum of the shares of ß-carotene, medium-chain triglyceride, d,l-alpha-tocopherol, octenyl succinate starch, glycerin, and water together amounts to at least 95 wt.-%, and the weight ratio between ß-carotene and medium-chain triglyceride ranges from 1:0.3 to 1:0.7.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 differs from claim 1 of the main request in that at its end the feature ""and wherein the beta-carotene particles have an average particle size of 0.05 to 0.8 μm and on average a X-ray amorphous content between 50 and 100%"" (features of claim 6 of the patent as granted) has been added.

VI. The opponent (respondent) argued in its response to the appeal, among other things, referring to T 936/09, that the (new) main request and auxiliary request 1 should not be admitted into the proceedings.

VII. The board issued a communication under Article 15(1) RPBA, stating that it intended not to admit the main request and auxiliary request 1 into the proceedings.

VIII. The respondent withdrew its opposition and was thus no longer involved in the proceedings.

IX. The appellant requested a decision based on the file.

X. Requests

The appellant requested the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent based on the main request or auxiliary request 1, both submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Article 12(4) RPBA 2007

1.1 According to Article 12(4) RPBA 2007, the Board considers all submissions of the parties under Article 12(1) RPBA 2007, insofar as they relate to the appeal case and meet the requirements of Article 12(2) RPBA 2007. However, Article 12(4) RPBA 2007 gives the Board the discretion to exclude facts, evidence, or requests that could have been presented in the first-instance proceedings.

1.2 In its communication under Article 15(1) RPBA, the Board expressed the preliminary opinion that it did not intend to admit the main request and auxiliary request 1 into the proceedings (Article 12(4) RPBA 2007). In this assessment, the Board followed the opinion of the respondent, which argued based on T 936/09 that both the main request submitted with the statement of appeal and auxiliary request 1 should not be admitted into the proceedings.

1.3 The appellant has not provided any reasons that could justify the admission of the main request and auxiliary request 1 into the proceedings. Even after the Board's communication and the withdrawal of the respondent's opposition, the appellant has not presented any arguments that would support the consideration of the main request and auxiliary request 1 in the appeal proceedings.

1.4 For the following reasons, the Board exercises its discretion under Article 12(4) RPBA 2007 not to admit the main request and auxiliary request 1 into the proceedings.

1.4.1 In the Board's view, T 936/09 is applicable in the present case. The essential conclusions drawn therein can be summarized as follows.

The patent holder is not legally obliged under the EPC to actively participate in the opposition proceedings. However, it is also not free to present or supplement its submissions at any time during the opposition or appeal proceedings at its discretion. If the patent holder decides not to comment substantively on the opposition at all—such as by arguments or by submitting amended claims—or decides not to supplement its submissions during the first-instance proceedings, but only addresses or supplements its submissions in the statement of appeal or the appeal brief, it must expect that the Board will not admit its submissions into the appeal proceedings in the exercise of its discretion under Article 12(4) RPBA 2007 (see Reasons for the Decision, point 9).

1.4.2 The Board shares the conclusions reached in T 936/09 and considers them applicable to the present case.

1.4.3 The appellant did not submit a response to the notice of opposition or any requests or arguments in the proceedings before the opposition division. It also did not participate in the first-instance proceedings in any other way but merely awaited the decision. Since the opposition division identified reasons against maintaining the patent in the granted form, it revoked the patent.

1.4.4 The appellant voluntarily chose not to participate in the proceedings before the opposition division and did not submit any requests or arguments in the first-instance proceedings.

Consequently, it is now defending the patent for the first time in the appeal proceedings within the framework of the present (new) main request and auxiliary request 1 to counter the objections raised with the notice of opposition. The appellant has not provided any reasons why the requests were only made in the appeal proceedings.

This is not in line with efficient procedural management, as well as the general requirement for a proper review process. The parties also have a duty to conduct the proceedings carefully and expeditiously. This includes presenting all relevant facts, evidence, arguments, and requests as early and completely as possible. This was not done by the appellant in the present case.

1.4.5 Considering the passive behavior of the appellant in the proceedings before the opposition division, the Board believes that the admission of the main request and auxiliary request 1 would not be in accordance with the legal nature of the appeal proceedings.

If these requests were admitted, the appellant would be attempting for the first time in the appeal proceedings to defend the patent. This would mean that the appeal proceedings would merely be a continuation of the opposition proceedings, which is not the purpose of the appeal proceedings.

1.4.6 Claim 1 of the main request is based on a combination of claims 1 and 5 of the patent as granted, and claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 is based on a combination of claims 1, 5, and 6 of the patent as granted.

Such subject matter was neither explicitly discussed in the decision of the opposition division nor was a decision made on it. The decision explicitly states only that the subject matter of claims 1 to 4 and 8 to 13 of the patent as granted is not novel over D2 and that the subject matter of claims 1, 2, and 4 of the patent as granted does not involve an inventive step over D4 as the closest prior art.

Thus, the appellant does not substantively address the contested decision in the appeal brief but rather attempts to circumvent it.

1.4.7 The appellant has not provided any reasons why the decision of the opposition division could have been erroneous. By incorporating the features of claim 5 as granted into claim 1, the focus of the discussion regarding the main request and auxiliary request 1 compared to the first-instance proceedings shifts significantly, creating a newly framed case in the appeal that raises new questions.

1.4.8 Furthermore, the appellant, aware of the negative preliminary opinion of the Board regarding the admission of the main request and auxiliary request 1, has not presented any arguments that could support the admission of these requests into the proceedings, but instead requested a decision based on the file. In light of these circumstances, the Board sees no reason to change its preliminary opinion expressed in the communication under Article 15(1) RPBA.

1.4.9 The appellant could and should have presented the main request and auxiliary request 1 already in the proceedings before the opposition division to be considered.

In this context, the Board decides not to admit the main request and auxiliary request 1 into the proceedings.

2. Therefore, there is no (allowable) request.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,DSM Nutritional Products AG,DSM Nutritional Products AG Wurmisweg 576 4303 Kaiseraugst / CH,"Kuhn, Dieter DSM Nutritional Products AG Patent Department Wurmisweg 576 4303 Kaiseraugst / CH",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VI. The oral hearing before the Board of Appeal took place on November 9, 2021.

VII. The appellant requested that the contested decision be set aside and that the patent be revoked in its entirety.

The respondent requested that the contested decision be set aside and that the patent be maintained in amended form according to the main request or alternatively according to auxiliary requests 1 to 5, all requests submitted during the oral hearing, and further alternatively, to dismiss the appeal or to maintain the patent in amended form based on auxiliary requests 7 to 11, submitted with the response to the appeal as auxiliary requests 1 to 5, limited.

VIII. The wording of the sole independent claim according to the main request submitted during the oral hearing is as follows (the feature structure corresponds to that of the contested decision):

""[1] A method for producing systems for the transdermal or permucosal administration of active substances, wherein the method comprises the following steps:

[2] - Providing a coated carrier film web (10), comprising a carrier film web (1) with an adhesive active substance-containing coating (2) thereon, [3] wherein active substance depot areas (12) are defined on the coated carrier film web (10) such that [4] the active substance depot areas (12) are arranged in two or more rows in the direction of the web (1) of the coated carrier film web (10) such that [5] the rows cannot be separated from each other in the direction of the web (1) by a straight line without cutting any active substance depot areas (12), [6] and that the proportion of the surface of the coated carrier film web (10) that is not used as an active substance depot area (12), disregarding the edge zones of the coated carrier film web (10), is less than 39% of the total area of the coated carrier film web (10); and

[7] - Cutting (S4) the coated carrier film web (10) in the direction of the web (1) into two or more partial webs (15a, 15b, 15c, 15d) such that [8] each partial web contains a row of active substance depot areas (12), [9] wherein no active substance depot areas (12) are cut during the cutting.""

IX. The appellant essentially argued as follows:

Admission of the main request

The main request could have been filed earlier and is therefore considered late. According to Article 114 (2) EPC in conjunction with Article 13 RPBA 2020, the main request should not be admitted.

Sufficient disclosure of the invention

The requirements of Article 83 EPC are not met. The technical teaching conveyed by claim 1 of the main request is shown in the patent document exclusively for circular active substance depot areas. At least for active substance depots with rectangular or polygonal surface geometries, the invention is not executable. The respondent itself stated in paragraph [0010] of the patent that the invention is applicable to non-rectangular surface geometries. From the exemplary arrangement depicted below, it is clearly evident,

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

that the active substance depots (12) arranged here in three rows cannot obviously be separated in the direction of the web as defined in paragraph [0025] of the patent by a straight line without cutting an active substance depot. Furthermore, cutting in the direction of the web in the sense of features 7 to 9 of claim 1 is not possible. For example, a zig-zag line running between the rectangles necessarily includes segments that run at an angle of 90 degrees to the direction of the web. When using other surface geometries, such as the butterfly shape, the cutting line even partially runs against the direction of the web. Moreover, the opposition division's suggestion that any shape that can be circumscribed by a circle is usable is misleading. The disclosure of a single way to carry out the invention is only sufficient if it enables the execution of the invention across the entire claimed scope (see T 409/91).

Inventive step

The starting point should be document D1 as the closest prior art, which discloses a conventional method with features 1 to 4 and 6. According to rough calculations, the proportion of the surface of the coated carrier film web that is not used as an active substance depot area, disregarding the edge zones of the coated carrier film web, is less than 39% of the total area of the coated carrier film web. The opposition division's objection that the patent discloses a matrix system in contrast to document D1 is not relevant. The multilayer laminate of document D1 has active substance depots, can be flexible, and has an adhesive layer.

The distinguishing feature 5 is independent of features 1 to 4; it is merely a concatenation of features. The objective technical problem to be solved is to create a space-saving layout for active substance depots.

Since this concerns manufacturing problems, the skilled person is not limited to the field of transdermal therapeutic systems (TT systems) but would also look for solutions in technical fields where similar problems arise. Although document D2 relates to the production by punching circular blanks made from strip-like substrates, particularly intended for cans, the technical background of the document emphasizes that efficient use of area in processing sheets as well as metal and non-metal rolls, including laminates, is fundamentally important. Contrary to the opposition division's decision, document D2 is thus not only to be read in the context of cans and blanks but addresses the objective problem posed. Furthermore, document D2 deals with cutting partial webs (column 10, lines 60 ff.). The problem of separating from the grid is irrelevant here, as claim 1 does not contain any feature in this regard.

A staggered row arrangement according to features 5 and 6 is generally known according to figures 3A and 5A of document D2. This arrangement can be read independently of a material or object. In the further processing of document D2, the individual longitudinal rows are to be separated by a wavy longitudinal cut without cutting through the intended circular shape, which can either have diameter D or diameter G. The cutting line is shown in figure 5B. The skilled person would therefore have resorted to the advantageous and waste-minimizing staggered arrangement of document D2 to separate the individual partial webs from document D1 without inventive effort and would have chosen a wavy cut in the direction of the web instead of a straight longitudinal cut.

Moreover, document D5 also confirms that a staggered arrangement of active substance depot areas is known from the prior art. In assessing inventive step, it should also be noted that according to paragraph [0029] of the patent, this arrangement could be a purely conceptual design, with the die-cutting of the active substance depot areas being carried out only at a later stage. Regarding wavy longitudinal cuts, reference is made to figures 4c and 4e of document D3.

Alternatively, the claimed method is also suggested starting from document D2 and using document D1.

The subject matter of claim 1 of the main request therefore does not involve an inventive step.

X. The respondent's arguments can be summarized as follows:

Admission of the main request

The main request is based on the granted set of claims, with only all apparatus claims being deleted. It was submitted at the beginning of the oral hearing as an economically procedural reaction to the Board's opinion expressed in its communication under Article 15 (1) RPBA 2020 regarding the non-allowability of the apparatus claims. It should be noted that the contested decision contains no reasoning regarding the apparatus claims that were already attacked at that time. Consequently, the main request should be admitted into the appeal proceedings.

Sufficient disclosure of the invention

The claimed invention is sufficiently disclosed. The active substance depot areas according to claim 1 are not defined by a simple geometric shape but by features 4 to 9. Thus, not every conceivable surface geometry falls under claim 1, but among others, geometric shapes that are not circular but can be circumscribed by a circle. The cutting line then runs between the circles. Rectangular active substance depot areas are not excluded from claim 1 in light of paragraph [0010] of the patent, even if the aim of the patent was to improve the use of the active substance-containing coating for an active substance depot with non-rectangular surface geometry. The sketch prepared by the appellant does not correspond to the teaching of the patent, as the direction of the web does not run according to the definition in paragraph [0025] of the patent in the direction of the longer side edge of the carrier film. In particular, figures 2 to 8 and paragraphs [0052], [0055] to [0057], and [0059] disclose how the active substance depots should be arranged to meet the aforementioned requirements. In its statements regarding rectangular surface geometries, the appellant confuses the contour of the cutting line, which includes among other things partial cuts transverse to the direction of the web, with the overall orientation of the cutting line in the direction of the web.

Inventive step

Document D1 relates to TT systems that contain active substance depots with a circular base area. It is thus regarded as the closest prior art. However, features 5 to 9 are not disclosed there.

In formulating the objective technical problem, features 7 to 9 must also be taken into account. It should be noted that the sticky object of the TT system must be easy to process. The task is therefore to provide a practically applicable manufacturing method for TT systems that ensures that the use of the active substance-containing coating is improved for non-rectangular surface geometries, whereby the individual elements of the active substance-containing coating can be easily separated from each other.

Document D1 does not provide any indication that a changed arrangement of the active substance depots could minimize the losses of the unused area.

Also, document D2, which relates to the processing of sheets as well as metal and non-metal rolls, particularly for the production of cans, does not suggest the claimed subject matter. The laminates mentioned in document D2 are not suitable for the production of TT systems. Document D2 comes from a completely different technical field and does not address the specific problems in the production of TT systems, which consist of multiple layers, usually made of polymers. Thus, problems in separating the active substance depot areas from the grid do not arise in document D2. The metals used in document D2 are much more tear-resistant compared to the polymers used in document D1 for the TT systems, so there is no risk that the circular blanks will be damaged during the grid removal. Another influencing factor is the adhesion strength of the active substance-containing coating to the carrier film, which does not need to be considered in document D2. The patent also points out that a theoretically optimal arrangement of active substance depots with a circular base area is not practically possible, as the grid structure to be removed must not tear and therefore a certain minimum width must not be undershot. This minimum width depends, for example, on the tear strength of the material, the adhesion strength of the active substance-containing coating, the processing speed, the grid removal device, and the size of the active substance depot areas. All these factors are irrelevant in the method of document D2. Consequently, the skilled person would not have considered the teaching of document D2 without knowledge of the present invention.

Even if the skilled person had referred to the teaching of document D2, they would not have arrived at the arrangement of the active substance depot areas claimed in the method of claim 1, as the disclosure of document D2 should not be interpreted in light of the patent document. The completely staggered arrangement according to figure 3A of document D2 does not correspond to the teaching of the patent, as it would not be technically practicable for TT systems. Also, in figure 3B of document D2, the circular blanks are arranged in such a way that the outer edges of the blanks touch, contrary to the teaching of the patent. The preferred embodiment according to figure 5A of document D2 concerns the arrangement of circular blanks, where the inner circle represents the actual blank, while the outer circle additionally includes unused area, i.e., grid. This arrangement also does not fall under claim 1 of the patent, as the actual blanks can be separated by a straight line. Figure 5B is merely an enlargement of figure 5A. Finally, figure 6A of document D2 proposes a particularly material-saving arrangement where the circular blanks touch. The grid is not removed in one piece, but the triangular, unused areas are to be punched out individually. Such an arrangement would not be compatible with the objective of feature 1.

The wavy longitudinal cuts known from document D3 are disclosed in a completely different context. This document does not address the problem of loss of unused carrier film at all.

The objection based on document D2 was raised by the appellant only during the oral hearing. It is late and should not be admitted.

Thus, the subject matter of claim 1 according to the main request involves an inventive step.","Reasons for the Decision

Admission of the Main Request

1. The main request underlying this decision was submitted for the first time at the beginning of the oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal. It differs from the patent in the granted version, which formed the basis for the contested decision to reject the opposition, only in that claims 6 to 14 have been deleted. Thus, the now presented main request pursues only the method claims 1 to 5 in the granted version.

2. Article 13 (2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA) 2020, which is applicable here according to the transitional provisions of Article 25 (1) and (3) RPBA 2020, implements the third stage of the convergence approach applicable in appeal proceedings (see Supplementary Publication 2 to OJ EPO 2020, p. 33, explanations to Article 13 paragraph 2). The provision stipulates that amendments to the appeal submissions of a party after the expiry of a period set by the Board in a communication under Rule 100 (2) EPC, or, if no such communication is issued, after the notification of the summons to the oral proceedings, shall generally not be taken into account unless the party concerned has shown compelling reasons that extraordinary circumstances exist.

a) Amendment of the Appeal Submission

3. In some decisions of the Boards of Appeal, it is held that the deletion of claims that were already the subject of the appeal proceedings does not constitute an amendment of the appeal submission, so that the Board has no discretion regarding their admission under Article 13 (2) RPBA 2020 (see, for example, T 995/18, point 2 of the reasons; T 981/17, point 3 of the reasons; T 2243/18, point 2 of the reasons; T 1792/19, point 2 of the reasons; T 1857/19, point 1.1 of the reasons).

4. The Board does not subscribe to this view for the following reasons.

4.1 Article 12 (3) RPBA 2020 requires that the statement of grounds of appeal and the response must contain the complete appeal submission of a party. The appeal submission under Article 12 (2) RPBA 2020 must address the requests, facts, objections, arguments, and evidence underlying the contested decision. As the Legal Board of Appeal has stated in J 14/19 (point 1.4 of the reasons), it follows from this that submissions by the parties that are not directed to the requests, facts, objections, arguments, or evidence contained in the statement of grounds of appeal or response constitute an amendment of the appeal submission. An example of this is mentioned in the subsequent point 1.5 of the reasons, which refers to an amendment of the patent. The Board has no doubt that the deletion of one or more independent claims, including any dependent claims, constitutes an amendment of the patent (see G 3/14, point 77 of the reasons: ""...by assuming an amendment that consists optionally in the deletion of one or more independent claims (including any dependent claims) and leaves the other independent as well as their dependent claims unaffected...""). Consequently, the Board shares the view expressed in T 1569/17 (point 4.3.1 of the reasons) that the deletion of independent claims that were already the subject of the appeal proceedings constitutes an amendment of the appeal submission within the meaning of Article 13 (2) RPBA 2020. The Boards of Appeal also reached a similar conclusion in T 1224/15 (point 5 of the reasons), T 482/19 (point 5.7 of the reasons), T 60/18 (point 7 of the reasons), and, albeit only hypothetically, in T 1857/19 (point 1.1 of the reasons: ""Even if the deletion of a claim category were always to be considered an amendment"").

4.2 The conclusion that the deletion of claims does not change the appeal submission, in that it does not result in a changed factual situation (T 995/18, T 981/17, T 1792/19, T 1857/19) or no (complete) re-evaluation (T 995/18, T 981/17), finds no support in the Rules of Procedure, in the Board's opinion. The Board believes that the question of whether an amendment of the appeal submission within the meaning of Article 13 (2) RPBA 2020 exists should be separated from considerations regarding the further course of the proceedings, which may play a role in the subsequent determination of whether extraordinary circumstances exist or whether the criteria relevant under Article 13 (1) RPBA 2020 are met.

5. For the reasons stated, the Board has concluded that the deletion of the granted device claims in the present case constitutes an amendment of the appeal submission, the admission of which is at the discretion of the Board under Article 13 (2) RPBA 2020.

b) Extraordinary Circumstances

6. As justification for the late submission of the main request, the respondent argued that it constituted a reaction to the preliminary opinion expressed by the Board in its communication under Article 15 (1) RPBA 2020 regarding the non-patentability of the device claims.

7. In point 10.3.2 of the communication under Article 15 (1) RPBA 2020, the Board expressed its preliminary opinion regarding the inventive step of the subject matter of claim 6 in the granted version based on document D2, stating that this independent device claim does not contain explicit features regarding how a separating device and a displacement device for producing TT systems should be adapted and how the active substance coating, which is applied in an adhesive manner, affects this. Furthermore, in point 10.3.3 of the communication, it was pointed out that none of the device claims 6, 10, or 12 in the granted version defines that the grid structure resulting from punching should not fall below a minimum width between the circular patches at any point. Regarding claim 12, it was communicated to the parties that it apparently does not contain structural features that are specifically required for a contouring device or punching device in the production of TT systems.

8. These aspects had not been addressed previously during the opposition and appeal proceedings. Furthermore, the Board shares the respondent's view that the opposition division failed to address the independent device claims in the contested decision, although the opponent had also raised objections regarding these claims.

9. Consequently, the new main request can be regarded as a reaction to the preliminary statement of the Board in the communication under Article 15 (1) RPBA 2020. The respondent has thus shown compelling reasons that extraordinary circumstances existed, justifying the admission of the main request even at this late stage of the proceedings.

10. Therefore, the Board admitted the main request in the exercise of its discretion (Article 13 (2) RPBA 2020).

Sufficient Disclosure of the Invention

11. In assessing whether the invention is disclosed in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for a person skilled in the art to carry it out, the overall content of the patent, including the description and drawings as well as the claims, must be considered. As convincingly demonstrated by the respondent, paragraphs [0052], [0055] to [0057], and [0059] of the patent describe in connection with the figures how the active substance reservoirs are to be arranged according to the requirements of claim 1. In particular, the disclosure of figure 4, according to which the separating line is formed in a wavy manner such that the distance Δu between two consecutive inflection points indicates the engagement of two interlocking partial paths along the respective wave line (see paragraph [0059]), enables the skilled person to separate active substance reservoir areas, which are arranged in two or more rows according to features 4 and 5, but which cannot be separated from each other by a straight line, nevertheless in the direction of travel into partial paths without cutting the active substance reservoir areas (features 7 to 9).

12. The Board cannot see why the skilled person should be unable to carry out the invention even with area geometries that deviate from the circular shape. Adapting the course of the wave line to the specific geometries is, in the Board's opinion, quite reasonable for the skilled person. In this context, the argument of the appellant that the invention is not executable for rectangular or polygonal area geometries fails for the reason that even then, the laterally interlocking rows of active substance reservoirs could be separated from each other by a wavy separating line. It must be acknowledged that in the case sketched by the appellant (see point IX above), the separating line would approach a rectangular wave running between the areas that are close to each other. However, it would not have posed any particular difficulties for the skilled person to carry out the invention even in such variants.

13. The appellant's consideration that a rectangular wave must necessarily have sections extending transversely to the direction of travel does not change the fact that the severing of the coated carrier film web into individual partial paths occurs in the direction of travel in the sense of feature 7. The Board follows the respondent's view that the direction of travel in the claimed context should be regarded as the overall orientation of the separating cut. Similarly, the skilled person would have adapted the wavy separating cut accordingly to sever a coated carrier film web with butterfly-shaped active substance reservoirs, depending on whether the specific arrangement required it, without changing its overall orientation in the direction of travel.

14. The decision cited by the appellant, T 409/91, does not provide a basis for questioning the executability of the claimed invention.

In the case underlying that decision, it concerned a group of chemical compounds (distillate fuels) characterized by a common feature, namely the presence of wax crystals that exhibit a certain particle size under specific conditions. In an auxiliary request, the lower and upper limits of the average particle size were claimed, which were to be achieved by certain additives disclosed in the description, although no additive was specified in the claim. The Board of Appeal concluded that the disclosure of a way to carry out the invention, which could only reach some members of the claimed class of chemical compounds, was not sufficient in the sense of Article 83 EPC, especially since the appellant did not contest that the description did not disclose any other method for achieving the desired particle size than the non-claimed addition of certain additives to the fuel and that no general technical knowledge regarding the production of such fuels was available to a skilled person. The Board of Appeal acknowledged that the question of whether the disclosure of a single way to carry out the invention is sufficient to enable a skilled person to carry out the invention across the entire claimed range is a factual question that must be decided on a case-by-case basis based on the available evidence and after weighing the probabilities (see point 3.5 of the reasons).

The situation is entirely different with the present patent. Claim 1 relates to a (non-chemical) manufacturing process that is sufficiently disclosed in the description and figures based on a specific embodiment with circular active substance reservoirs. As stated above, the mere fact that the area geometry of the active substance reservoirs is not defined in claim 1 does not prevent the skilled person from carrying out suitable variants of the invention, e.g., rectangular or polygonal active substance reservoirs. In this context, the disclosure does not need to contain specific indications on how to achieve all conceivable variants of the area geometries that fall under claim 1 of the main request.

15. Consequently, the requirements of Article 83 EPC are met.

Inventive Step

a) Starting Point

16. The parties agree that document D1 is to be considered the closest prior art. Although the appellant suggested at the end of the oral proceedings that document D2 could also be used as a basis for assessing inventive step, the Board is of the opinion that the appellant has not credibly demonstrated that the method disclosed therein, intended for the production of metal cans, is suitable for further development as a manufacturing process within the application scope defined by claim 1, namely regarding systems for transdermal or permucosal administration of active substances. Document D2 therefore obviously does not constitute a suitable starting point for assessing inventive step. Thus, the objection of lack of inventive step based on document D2 could not succeed. The question of its admission can therefore be left open.

b) Distinguishing Features

17. It is undisputed that document D1 discloses features 1 to 4 of claim 1. According to the embodiment shown in figures 5a and 5b, the active substance 5 is applied to a carrier film web 9 coated with an adhesive layer 7 via a perforated film 61, so that after removing the film, several rows of circular active substance reservoirs aligned in the direction of travel are formed.

18. The appellant believes that feature 6 is also disclosed in document D1. This conclusion is derived from a ""rough calculation"" with reference to figure 5b. However, the Board does not see how the schematic perspective representations in figure 5b can lead to the understanding that less than 39% of the total area of the coated carrier film web, disregarding the edge zones, is not used as active substance reservoir area, especially since the drawings rather suggest that the actually unused portion is significantly larger. The fact that paragraph [0004] of the patent conveys a contrary impression (""seems to"") does not change this.

19. Therefore, the subject matter of claim 1 differs from the method known from document D1 by features 5 to 9.

c) Objective Technical Problem

20. The Board agrees with the respondent that the objective technical problem is to design the production of TT systems in such a way as to improve the utilization of the active substance coating. However, the appellant has not convincingly demonstrated why the exclusion of the rectangular shape and the easy separation of the individual elements should also be included in the problem formulation. On the other hand, the Board sees no causal connection in the appellant's problem formulation of creating a space-saving layout for active substance reservoirs with the separating step of features 7 to 9. Therefore, the objective technical problem can be seen as improving the utilization of the active substance coating in the production of TT systems.

d) Obviousness

21. The appellant argues that the skilled person, seeking a solution to the objective technical problem, would have referred to the technical teaching of document D2 because similar manufacturing problems also arise in the production of circular blanks. The respondent countered with the argument that the teaching disclosed in document D2 is not suitable for the production of the TT systems known from document D1.

22. According to established case law, in assessing inventive step, in addition to the prior art in the specific field of the patent, prior art in adjacent fields and/or in a higher-level general technical field may also be considered, particularly when similar problems arise in the adjacent field as in the specific field of the patent and when the skilled person in this specific field is expected to have knowledge of the existence of the other field (Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the EPO, 9th edition 2019, I.D.8.2).

23. The Board agrees with the respondent that document D2 originates from a technical field where, compared to the production of systems for administering active substances through the skin (transdermal) or mucous membranes (permucosal), entirely different boundary conditions apply. It has convincingly demonstrated that in the field of document D2, unlike for severing a carrier film web typically made of plastic with an adhesive active substance coating, factors such as tear strength or adhesion strength when punching can lids from a metal strip do not play a decisive role. The fact that document D2 also refers to a laminated structure (""laminations"") does not contradict this conclusion, as no application other than the production of metal cans is evident from document D2 (see column 5, lines 46 to 48).

24. Even if the skilled person had had an incentive to improve the utilization of the active substance coating known from document D1 by referring to document D2, this would not have led in an obvious manner to the subject matter of claim 1.

In this regard, the appellant pointed to figures 3A, 5A, and 5B of document D2, which each illustrate a space-saving arrangement of circular blanks. However, regarding figure 3A, it should be considered that this merely serves as evidence for a staggered arrangement known from the prior art (column 8, lines 23 to 24: ""prior art arrangement""). Although the depicted metal strip is severed at two points along zig-zag lines 3 running transversely to the direction of travel, the description of the figures in column 8, lines 23 to 61 does not reveal how the circular blanks are separated from each other in the direction of travel. Regarding the embodiment according to figures 5A and 5B, the Board agrees with the appellant that the separation of the laterally interlocking longitudinal rows occurs through wavy separating cuts 4a. However, the respondent is correct in stating that at least in figure 5A, a straight line can be drawn between the circular blanks with diameter D, so that feature 5 is missing. It is also not immediately clear from figure 5B whether the inner circles are arranged such that the rows cannot be separated in the direction of travel by a straight line without cutting the circles. It is therefore not evident that the distinguishing features 5 to 9 are suggested by the overall disclosure of document D2.

25. Furthermore, the other prior art cited by the appellant does not provide the skilled person with any incentive to modify the method known from document D1 in the sense of the subject matter of claim 1.

Although a staggered, space-saving arrangement of circular active substance reservoirs in the sense of feature 5 is depicted in figure 4 of document D5, and it can be assumed based on the description on page 9, second paragraph, that it was obvious to the skilled person in the technical field of medical patches at the time of the invention to choose the distance between adjacent active substance reservoirs such that the unused portion of the coated surface would lie within the very broad range of feature 6, the active substance reservoirs in document D5 are punched out individually from the carrier film web contrary to the requirements of features 7 to 9 (see figure 2).

According to document D3, a wavy longitudinal cut 2 is introduced into a lower protective film 1. However, the so-called ""cut-and-tear line 2"" does not serve to separate the active substance reservoir areas arranged in parallel rows (see figures 4(e), (i), (k), and (m); column 5, lines 19 to 37).

26. For the reasons stated, the subject matter of claim 1 according to the main request involves an inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

Conclusion

27. Since the claims of the present main request meet the requirements of the EPC, the contested decision is to be set aside and the case is to be remitted to the opposition division with the order to maintain the patent on the basis of claims 1 to 5 according to the main request and with a description to be adapted accordingly.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1.

I. The appeal of the appellant (applicant) is directed against the decision of the examining division to refuse European patent application No. 10 768 958.0 under Article 97(2) EPC.

II. The decision of the examining division concerned the following independent claims of the main request before it:

Claim 1:

""Biocompatible composition that is polymerizable into a hydrogel-forming material and is based on a hydrophilic polymer, wherein the hydrophilic polymer is cross-linkable serum albumin or cross-linkable serum protein, for use in inhibiting and/or preventing angiogenesis or endothelial cell proliferation.""

Claim 8:

""Biocompatible composition of a polymerized hydrogel-forming material obtained by polymerizing a composition based on serum albumin or serum proteins, for inhibiting and/or preventing angiogenesis or endothelial cell proliferation.""

III. The following documents of the prior art were cited during the examination procedure:

D1: DE 10 2008 008071 A1

D2: WO 2009/010232 A1

D3: WO 01/60335 A2

IV. According to the examining division, the patent application in its present form did not meet the requirements of the EPC for the following reasons:

a) The claimed anti-angiogenic effect of the claimed hydrogel-forming polymerizable material (Albugel or its polymerizable precursor) was not demonstrated. In particular, Example 4 (chicken embryo CAM) only showed a lack of angiogenic influence but no inhibition of angiogenesis. Therefore, the claimed invention was not sufficiently disclosed (Article 83 EPC).

b) Novelty was not given, as Claim 1 must be read not as a claim for a second medical use under Article 54(5) EPC, but as a product claim, for the following reasons. Since the Albugel defined in the claim is known per se from D1, the claim is not novel.

i) The effect of inhibiting angiogenesis is not a symptom of a disease that exists prior to the introduction of the claimed composition, but rather a side effect of the introduction of the composition itself. Therefore, the introduction of the composition is not a therapy, as there is no pathological condition prior to the introduction.

ii) The application only shows that no blood vessels grow into the introduced material, i.e., into the Albugel, but does not demonstrate an active anti-angiogenic effect of the composition. Since no anti-angiogenic effect on the surrounding tissue is shown, no therapeutic treatment takes place. The effect only acts on the implant itself, not on the body. Reference was made to T 611/09.

c) Claim 8 was not drafted in the correct format for a claim under Article 54(5) EPC and must therefore also be read as a product claim. This claim is therefore also not novel with respect to D1.

These objections were raised against all requests submitted to the examining division.

V. In his statement of appeal, the appellant argued that the objections of the examining division were unfounded. He defended the claims in his main request in the form underlying the decision.

An anti-angiogenic effect of the claimed compositions was demonstrated by the experiments conducted. The requirements of Article 83 EPC were therefore fulfilled.

The demonstrated anti-angiogenic effect of the compositions leads to a therapeutic treatment of the body, not just an effect on the implant. According to Article 54(5) EPC, the intended use must therefore be taken into account in the novelty assessment. All claims are therefore novel with respect to D1.

Inventive step was not discussed in the contested decision. If this point needed to be discussed, the matter should be referred back to the opposition division.

VI. On September 11, 2020, the Board communicated its preliminary assessment of the facts and legal situation to the appellant by a communication under Rule 100(2) EPC.

The Board considered the appeal to be essentially well-founded. However, it was of the opinion that the claims also encompassed non-therapeutic applications and therefore needed to be restricted accordingly. Claim 8 was also not drafted in a format corresponding to Article 54(5) EPC.

VII. The appellant subsequently submitted a modified set of claims on November 19, 2020.

The modified independent claims have the following wording (changes highlighted):

Claim 1:

""Biocompatible composition that is polymerizable into a hydrogel-forming material and is based on a hydrophilic polymer, wherein the hydrophilic polymer is cross-linkable serum albumin or cross-linkable serum protein, for therapeutic use in inhibiting and/or preventing angiogenesis or endothelial cell proliferation.""

Claim 8:

""Biocompatible composition of a polymerized hydrogel-forming material obtained by polymerizing a composition based on serum albumin or serum proteins, for therapeutic use in inhibiting and/or preventing angiogenesis or endothelial cell proliferation.""

VIII. Following a telephone consultation, the appellant submitted modified sets of claims by letters dated July 23, 2021, and September 20, 2021, in which the dependent claims were adjusted accordingly to the independent claims reproduced above.

IX. By letter dated September 20, 2021, the appellant requested as the sole request the grant of a patent based on the set of claims submitted on that date.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Admissibility of the amended claims under Article 13(2) RPBA 2020

According to Article 13(2) RPBA, amendments to the submissions of a party after the expiry of a time limit set in a communication under Rule 100(2) EPC are generally not taken into account, unless extraordinary circumstances can be demonstrated by compelling reasons.

In the present case, the Board found the arguments presented in the statement of appeal to be convincing; the essential grounds for rejection by the examining division were therefore addressed in this respect. The later submission of amended claims is not a change to the appeal submissions, but essentially a reaction to objections raised by the Board, aimed at arriving at a patentable set of claims and avoiding a referral back to the examining division on the matter (Article 111 EPC).

Under these circumstances, the amended set of claims is admitted into the proceedings.

3. Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

3.1 Compared to claim 1 in its originally filed form, the original use claim has been reformulated into a use-limited product claim under Article 54(5) EPC. This is not objectionable under Article 123(2) EPC.

Furthermore, the claim has been limited to therapeutic uses. Although there is no passage in the original disclosure that corresponds literally to this amended claim, the introduction of the term ""therapeutic"" does not insert any originally undisclosed subject matter. On page 12, second paragraph, the use of the claimed compositions in the treatment of angiogenesis-associated diseases is described; this means nothing other than therapy. It is also disclosed that this occurs by preventing endothelial cell proliferation, as indicated on page 5, last paragraph.

3.2 The amendments made in claim 8 and in the dependent claims are analogous. The reasoning regarding claim 1 therefore applies correspondingly.

4. Sufficient Disclosure (Article 83 EPC)

4.1 Technical Background

The application describes a material that inhibits angiogenesis, i.e., the formation of blood vessels originating from endothelial cells. Anti-angiogenic drugs are used, for example, in tumor therapy, but implants can also be coated with such active substances to prevent the formation of unwanted swellings or thickening, see pages 2 and 3 of the description.

The described material is functionalized serum albumin or serum protein that can be cross-linked into a hydrogel using a hydrophilic polymer, such as PEG. The polymerized material is referred to in the application as ""Albugel."" The materials defined in the claims are known from D1.

4.2 Since the material itself is known from D1, the question of sufficient disclosure does not arise for the material itself, but for the claimed use. As correctly pointed out by the examining division, in the case of claims directed to a second medical use, achieving the claimed effect is a functional feature of the claim. It must therefore be sufficiently disclosed to the skilled person how this effect can be achieved (see case law, II C, 7.2).

4.2.1 The experimental part of the patent application discloses, among other results:

a) No endothelial cells proliferate on the Albugel, even with the addition of gelatin, which normally promotes cell proliferation (see section ""Results"" on pages 18/19 of the application).

b) VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation can be prevented by coating with Albugel. Endothelial cells do not grow into filters coated with Albugel (see section ""Results"" on page 21).

c) In a chicken egg test (CAM test), it was demonstrated that blood vessels do not grow towards the Albugel (page 22). The same result is shown in a test in mice (pages 22/23 of the application).

Overall, the Board believes it has been demonstrated that Albugel inhibits angiogenesis particularly because it does not provide a substrate for proliferation to the endothelial cells.

4.2.2 The examining division was of the opinion that the data presented in the patent application only indicated a local absence of an angiogenic influence. However, this does not imply that Albugel has an angiogenesis-inhibiting effect. The claimed inhibition and/or prevention of angiogenesis or endothelial cell proliferation is therefore not sufficiently disclosed.

4.2.3 The Board cannot agree with this.

As stated above, a clear local anti-angiogenic effect has been demonstrated in the patent application through various in vitro and in vivo tests. At the sites where the gel is applied, no angiogenesis occurs because the endothelial cells can neither adhere nor proliferate. This demonstrated effect undoubtedly corresponds to the claimed inhibition and/or prevention of angiogenesis or endothelial cell proliferation.

Further data, such as from in vivo experiments in the human body, are not required in this case to demonstrate the claimed effect. There are no justified doubts that the obtained results should not be transferable to a therapeutic treatment of the human/animal body.

Similarly, a systemic effect on the human body is not a prerequisite for recognizing a therapeutic application. Local effects can ultimately also serve therapeutic purposes.

4.3 The objection raised by the examining division under Article 83 EPC therefore does not withstand scrutiny.

5. Novelty (Article 54(5) EPC)

5.1 The claims are formulated as use-limited product claims according to a second medical use under Article 54(5) EPC.

The examining division recognized a lack of novelty with respect to D1.

It was undisputed that the use feature in the inhibition and/or prevention of angiogenesis or endothelial cell proliferation is not disclosed in D1; there, identical materials are used for tissue restoration or as drug-release implants.

However, it was disputed whether this feature of the claim is limiting. The examining division was of the opinion that the claimed use is not therapeutic and should therefore not be read as a limiting feature in the sense of Article 54(5) EPC.

5.2 One argument of the examining division was that the inhibition of angiogenesis, as shown in the patent application, does not treat a symptom of a disease that exists prior to the introduction of the claimed composition. Rather, it is a side effect of the introduction of the composition itself. Therefore, the introduction of the composition is not a therapy, as there is no pathological condition prior to the introduction.

The Board cannot follow this. Even if, as stated by the examining division, an Albugel coating on an implant only combats the side effects of the introduction of the implant, this is still a therapeutic or prophylactic use, as it aims to prevent the occurrence of a pathological condition, namely swelling and thickening. It is therefore irrelevant whether a pathological condition existed prior to the introduction of the implant.

5.3 A second argument of the examining division was that it is only shown that no blood vessels grow into the introduced Albugel. There is no active anti-angiogenic effect of the composition on the surrounding tissue. The effect only acts on the implant itself, not on the body. Reference was made to T 611/09.

The Board does not agree with this. Even if one were to take the position that the introduced Albugel only prevents angiogenesis at its edges, this would still be an effect on the body. After all, physiological processes in the body that would otherwise occur are inhibited. The effect of Albugel clearly targets the body to be treated, not the implant. The cited case T 611/09 concerned an antibiotic solution that was essentially used to disinfect an implant and had no effect on the body to be treated. This case is therefore not comparable to the present situation.

5.4 The claimed uses are therefore therapeutic in nature. The use feature in the inhibition and/or prevention of angiogenesis or endothelial cell proliferation must be understood as limiting in the sense of Article 54(5) EPC. Moreover, the present claims are anyway literally limited to therapeutic uses following the amendments made during the appeal proceedings.

5.5 No further novelty objections were raised. The Board also does not recognize any. Novelty over the cited documents D1-D3 is therefore given.

6. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

Objections regarding a lack of inventive step were neither raised in the contested decision nor in the previous course of the examination proceedings.

The Board also sees no such objection with respect to the cited documents D1-D3.

None of the documents D1-D3 describes materials with anti-angiogenic properties.

D1 discloses the Albugel defined in the present claims. This material can be used for various purposes, such as tissue reconstruction or as a drug-release implant, see claim 12 of D1.

Starting from D1, the skilled person faced the technical problem of finding a further use for the Albugel described there.

This problem was solved by the claimed therapeutic use for the inhibition and/or prevention of angiogenesis or endothelial cell proliferation. Since the claimed materials show the claimed effect, the problem has indeed been solved; this has already been explained above in the section on sufficient disclosure under Article 83 EPC.

The claimed solution is not suggested to the skilled person by the cited prior art. None of the cited documents deals with angiogenesis or endothelial cell proliferation. Therefore, a skilled person had no indication that the materials described in D1 would be suitable for the claimed purposes.

Inventive step over the cited prior art is therefore present.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The contested decision is annulled.

III. In the opposition proceedings, a lack of novelty and inventive step was asserted under Article 100(a) EPC. In the contested decision, the opposition division concluded that the amended claims submitted by the patent proprietor during the opposition proceedings overcame the novelty objections with respect to D1-D3 and that the claimed cosmetic compositions were not suggested to the skilled person starting from D4 as the closest prior art.

IV. In her statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant argued that the independent claims of the version of the patent maintained by the opposition division lacked novelty in view of the newly submitted documents D11 and D12. Furthermore, the claimed compositions were suggested to the skilled person starting from D4, contrary to the decision made by the opposition division. She therefore requested that the patent be revoked.

V. In her response to the appeal, the respondent argued that the newly submitted documents D11 and D12 should have been submitted during the opposition proceedings and should therefore not be admitted into the proceedings under Article 12(4) RPBA 2007. Moreover, they were not detrimental to novelty. Inventive step was present starting from D4, as established in the opposition decision. She therefore requested that the appeal be dismissed; alternatively, she requested that the patent be maintained in amended form based on a set of claims submitted with the response to the appeal.

VI. On October 23, 2020, the parties were informed in a communication under Rule 100(2) EPC about the preliminary assessment of the facts and legal situation by the Board. The parties were given a period of four months to respond.

The Board was preliminarily of the opinion that D11 and D12 should not be admitted into the proceedings. It considered novelty and inventive step to be given.

VII. By letter dated February 19, 2021, the appellant submitted the test report D13. She argued that the results of this test report demonstrated that there was no inventive step.

VIII. By summons dated March 9, 2021, an oral hearing was scheduled for June 24, 2021.

IX. By letter dated April 7, 2021, the respondent requested that the test report D13 no longer be admitted into the appeal proceedings.

X. By letter dated June 21, 2021, the appellant submitted documents D14-D20. She argued that these documents served to reinforce the novelty objection based on D11.

XI. The oral hearing took place on June 24, 2021.

During the oral hearing, the issues of the admission of documents D11-D20, novelty, and inventive step were discussed.

At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.

XII. The final requests of the parties were:

The appellant (opponent) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of European Patent No. 2276449.

The respondent (patent proprietor) requested the dismissal of the appeal and thus the maintenance of the patent in the version upheld by the opposition division (main request) or alternatively the maintenance according to auxiliary request 1, submitted with the response to the appeal. She also requested that documents D11-D20 not be admitted into the proceedings.

XIII. The essential arguments of the parties are outlined and addressed in the reasons for the decision.

XIV. The independent claim of the patent in the version maintained by the opposition division reads:

Cosmetic preparation in the form of an emulsion or dispersion containing

a) 2-(4'-Diethylamino-2'-hydroxybenzoyl)-benzoic acid hexyl ester and

b) one or more fragrance substances from the group of compounds Linalool, Hexylcinnamal, Benzylsalicylate and

c) one or more additional UV filters chosen from groups of compounds (...) [Note of the Board: A longer list of possible UV filters follows]

wherein the total concentration of fragrance substances in the preparation is from 0.00001 to 1%, based on the weight of the preparation.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

However, it is not successful, as will be explained below.

2. Admission of Documents D11-D20 into the Appeal Proceedings

D11 and D12 were submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal to demonstrate a lack of novelty. D14-D20 were submitted later in the proceedings to reinforce the novelty objection based on D11. D13 is an experimental report intended to demonstrate a lack of inventive step.

2.1 D11 and D12

2.1.1 Since D11 and D12 were submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal, prior to the entry into force of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA) 2020, the admission of these documents is governed by Article 12(4) RPBA 2007. This is stipulated in the transitional provisions in Article 25(2) RPBA 2020.

According to Article 12(4) RPBA 2007, it is at the discretion of the Board to not admit facts, evidence, or requests that could have been presented in the first-instance proceedings or were not admitted there.

2.1.2 The amended claims, on the basis of which the patent was maintained, were submitted by the patent owner with the response to the notice of opposition on December 1, 2017, i.e., ten months before the scheduled date of the oral proceedings in the opposition proceedings, which were then canceled following the withdrawal of the request for oral proceedings by the opponent and current appellant. In the annex to the summons for oral proceedings, the opposition division explained why the patent could be maintained based on these amended claims. The appellant did not respond to this assessment.

2.1.3 The Board is of the opinion that D11 and D12, as additional documents that the appellant believes call into question the novelty of the claims ultimately maintained in the opposition proceedings, could not only have been submitted in the opposition proceedings but also had to be submitted there.

This would have been permissible at the latest in response to the summons from the opposition division for oral proceedings, which had indicated the possibility of maintaining the patent based on the amended documents. In response, the appellant did not raise any further objections but withdrew the request for oral proceedings. No further substantial submissions were made, including in response to the opposition division's communications regarding the adaptation of the description to the claims deemed allowable.

The Board therefore sees no justification in the present case for introducing additional allegedly novelty-destroying documents only in the context of an appeal procedure.

2.1.4 The appellant has justified the late submission in the appeal proceedings by stating that these documents are prima facie relevant and should therefore be admitted to avoid knowingly maintaining an invalid patent.

2.1.5 The Board cannot agree with this view. Even assuming, which does not need to be further discussed here, that prima facie relevance is a criterion for the admission of documents under Article 12(4) RPBA 2007, the Board cannot recognize such relevance.

It is clear from the statement of appeal (see points 4.1 and 4.2) that the individual features of the independent claim of the maintained version can only be assembled from lists disclosed at various points in the description by extracting them. There is no reference to a specific disclosure of novelty-destroying compositions. The day creams on pages 84 and 85 of D11 are cited to illustrate typical concentration ranges of fragrance substances, not as novelty-destroying examples in themselves.

It is therefore not apparent to the Board that these documents are prima facie, i.e., at first glance, novelty-destroying.

2.1.6 In response to this position of the Board, the appellant argued that the (even later) submitted documents D14-D20 demonstrate, through a closer examination of the fragrance substances used in D11, that the day creams on pages 84/85 of D11 are novelty-destroying for the maintained claims.

2.1.7 Notwithstanding various questions raised by the respondent regarding the content of documents D14-D20, their admission into the proceedings, and the fact that some of these documents are not publicly available, the Board finds that the mere fact that secondary documents are needed for a potentially novelty-destroying interpretation of D11 is further evidence that D11 is not prima facie relevant.

2.1.8 Therefore, D11 and D12 are not admitted into the appeal proceedings.

2.2 D14-D20

2.2.1 These documents were submitted on June 21, 2021, i.e., three days before the oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal.

Their admission is therefore governed by Article 13(2) RPBA 2020. According to this provision, changes to a party's appeal case after the issuance of a communication under Rule 100(2) EPC or after the summons for oral proceedings are generally not taken into account. Exceptions require compelling reasons for the existence of exceptional circumstances.

In the present case, these documents were submitted after the issuance of a communication under Rule 100(2) EPC, after the deadline for responding to this communication had expired, and after the summons for oral proceedings had been issued.

2.2.2 The appellant argued that these documents were identified for the first time on June 17, 2021, i.e., one week before the date of the oral proceedings. They clearly demonstrate, through a closer examination of fragrance substances, that the examples on pages 84/85 of D11 are novelty-destroying. There is therefore no conscious tactical or abusive motivation on the part of the appellant.

The Board does not wish to dispute the latter. However, Article 13(2) RPBA 2020 requires the existence of exceptional circumstances for changes to the appeal case at such a late stage. Such circumstances have not been convincingly demonstrated by the appellant. A search for such documents could have been conducted earlier. The fact that the Board, in its communication under Rule 100(2) EPC, did not intend to admit D11 and D12 into the proceedings nor found the objections based on them convincing is also not an exceptional circumstance under Article 13(2) RPBA 2020, especially since the four-month response period set in that communication was not even adhered to.

The appellant's reference to prima facie relevance is also unavailing. Even if, which is not to be decided here, this criterion were to take precedence over the conditions of Article 13(2) RPBA 2020, such relevance is not present in the current case. These documents would only be relevant to the novelty question in combination with D11, not on their own. Furthermore, they contain no reference to this document, so it is not even clear whether identical ingredients were examined. There is certainly no prima facie relevance in the sense that these documents would lead to the revocation of the patent upon superficial examination.

2.2.3 Therefore, D14-D20 are not admitted into the proceedings under Article 13(2) RPBA 2020.

2.3 D13

2.3.1 D13 was submitted with the response to the Board's communication under Rule 100(2) EPC. The criteria of Article 13(2) RPBA 2020 also apply.

D13 contains comparative tests intended to cast doubt on the inventive step of the claims.

2.3.2 The appellant justified the late submission of this experiment by stating that it was a response to the Board's communication under Rule 100(2) EPC. There were also exceptional circumstances, as these tests showed the opposite of what had previously been assumed in the proceedings. The patent must be revoked due to this new situation.

2.3.3 The Board cannot recognize any exceptional circumstances that would justify the submission of D13 at this stage of the proceedings.

Inventive step was acknowledged in the opposition decision based on D4 with reference to the comparative test contained in the contested patent (paragraph [0075]). This issue had already been extensively discussed in the opposition proceedings. In the summons for oral proceedings before the opposition division, it was noted that there was no evidence for the claim made by the appellant (see point 12.9.1 of the summons dated March 2, 2018). This preliminary opinion was adopted in the decision, as the appellant did not present anything further in the opposition proceedings (point 6.2.1 of the reasons for the decision). The submission of D13 is therefore not a reaction to any new objection from the Board of Appeal but relates to a disputed fact that has been in contention since the opposition proceedings.

2.3.4 The fact that the appellant believes that the patent should be revoked based on the data in D13 because they show the opposite of the data in the proceedings cannot be considered an exceptional circumstance in the sense of Article 13(2) RPBA 2020.

On the one hand, such reasoning would apply to any late submission by an opponent in the appeal proceedings, which would essentially render the provisions of Article 114(2) EPC and the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal moot.

On the other hand, it is also not the case that the tests clearly show the opposite of the tests conducted in the contested patent. The respondent rightly pointed out that the tests in D13 concern shorter storage times, contain no data on light stability, and the formulations of the compositions appear unclear due to the repeated indication of ""qs"" for individual components. Even assuming that the data were indeed contradictory, the interpretation of such test results would still be subject to the evidentiary assessment of the Board of Appeal. Therefore, one cannot speak of a clear situation.

2.3.5 D13 is therefore not admitted into the appeal proceedings under Article 13(2) RPBA 2020.

Main Request

3. Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

3.1 The opposition division recognized the novelty of the amended claims over the documents cited in the opposition proceedings D1-D3, see point 2 of the contested decision.

This finding was not challenged by the appellant, and the Board sees no reason to doubt this decision of the opposition division.

3.2 The further documents cited by the appellant, D11, D12, and D14-D20, are not part of the proceedings, as explained above.

3.3 Therefore, novelty is given.

4. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

4.1 The claims relate to cosmetic preparations in the form of an emulsion or dispersion. In particular, these compositions contain the substance 2-(4'-Diethylamino-2'-hydroxybenzoyl)-benzoic acid ethyl ester (component (a) of claim 1), which can lead to the cosmetic compositions containing it losing their fragrance prematurely, see paragraph [0004] of the contested patent. This loss of fragrance is to be counteracted by the composition containing one or more additional UV filters (component (c) of claim 1) and one or more fragrance substances from the group Linalool, Hexylcinnamate, or Benzylsalicylate (component (b) of claim 1). The patent contains a comparative test in paragraph [0075], in which a fragrance-stabilizing effect of these fragrance substances is demonstrated, particularly at a storage temperature of 40°C or under light exposure.

4.2 Closest Prior Art

The closest prior art was unanimously considered to be D4, as also stated in the contested decision (see point 4 there). The contested patent differs from the compositions disclosed in D4 in that the claimed preparations contain one or more fragrance substances from the group Linalool, Hexylcinnamate, or Benzylsalicylate (component (b) of claim 1). This was undisputed and therefore does not need to be further elaborated.

4.3 Problem and Solution

4.3.1 Starting from the compositions of D4, the technical problem was to provide cosmetic compositions containing 2-(4'-Diethylamino-2'-hydroxybenzoyl)-benzoic acid ethyl ester (component (a) of claim 1) that are more stable in fragrance during storage.

The claimed solution to the problem is compositions according to claim 1, characterized in that they contain one or more fragrance substances from the group Linalool, Hexylcinnamate, or Benzylsalicylate.

It was disputed whether this problem was actually solved by the claimed compositions.

4.3.2 The respondent relied on the comparative test in paragraph [0075] of the patent. In this test, a composition containing component (a), additional UV filters (including titanium dioxide and phenylbenzimidazolesulfonic acid), as well as Linalool, Hexylcinnamate, and Benzylsalicylate is compared with a composition without the latter components. It turns out that under various storage conditions, especially at a storage temperature of 40°C and under light exposure, the composition according to the invention loses less fragrance than the comparative composition. In their view, the problem posed was therefore solved. The opposition division also came to this conclusion in its decision (see point 6 of the reasons for the decision).

4.3.3 In contrast, the appellant argued that the problem posed had not been solved, at least not across the entire breadth of the claim.

They argued that the comparative test at most proves that a combination of all three components (b) leads to improved fragrance stability, but does not demonstrate that each individual component has a fragrance-stabilizing effect on its own.

They further argued that it was not shown that a fragrance-stabilizing effect observed in the tested composition is transferable to other compositions that differ in the choice of UV filters. A variety of structurally different UV filters are listed in component (c) of the claim.

4.3.4 The Board does not find the appellant's arguments convincing.

A fragrance-stabilizing effect of the three components Linalool, Hexylcinnamate, or Benzylsalicylate is demonstrated by the comparative test in the patent. It is true that the individual contribution of each component cannot be determined from the conducted comparison. However, it is also not proven that one or more of these components do not show an effect individually. No technical arguments were presented in this regard; the appellant only expressed their doubts in general terms. The comparative test criticized by the appellant was already present in the published patent application and is part of the granted patent. The appellant was free to challenge the validity of this test through their own experiments in the opposition proceedings. This did not happen.

The appellant's submission regarding the variety of possible UV filters is also unsubstantiated. The compositions used in the comparative test contain structurally quite different UV filters, including titanium dioxide, ethylhexyl salicylate, and phenylbenzimidazolesulfonic acid. An influence of the structure of the UV filters is therefore not immediately apparent and has not been convincingly demonstrated without corresponding data.

4.3.5 The Board therefore concludes that the claimed compositions provide a solution to the technical problem of finding cosmetic compositions with increased fragrance stability, starting from D4. The Board does not follow the appellant's view that at most the technical problem of finding alternative cosmetic compositions has been solved.

4.4 Obviousness of the Solution

A fragrance-stabilizing effect of Linalool, Hexylcinnamate, or Benzylsalicylate on compositions containing component (a) is not described in any of the cited documents.

The appellant argued that Linalool, Hexylcinnamate, or Benzylsalicylate are common fragrance substances and are used in many compositions. This was not disputed by the respondent, and the Board shares the same view. However, the skilled person had no reason, starting from D4, to add any of the three compounds Linalool, Hexylcinnamate, or Benzylsalicylate to the compositions described there to solve the posed problem. The property of these compounds to stabilize the fragrance of compositions containing 2-(4'-Diethylamino-2'-hydroxybenzoyl)-benzoic acid ethyl ester was unknown to them.

4.5 Inventive step is therefore present.

5. In summary, it can be stated that the appellant's submissions in the appeal proceedings cannot undermine the opposition division's decision to maintain the patent in amended form.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,appeal dismissed,Henkel AG & Co.

I. European Patent No. 2 532 370 was granted with 13 claims. Claim 1 of the patent read as follows:

""1. Water-based, biocompatible preparation for use in surgical treatment of the eye, comprising the selective staining of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and/or epiretinal membranes (ERM) in the human or animal eye and removal of the stained membrane, containing at least one dye selected from the group consisting of: triphenylmethane dyes, cyanine dyes, and/or natural dyes or mixtures thereof, wherein the preparation has a density in the range of 1.01 g/cm**(3) to 1.5 g/cm**(3), and wherein no monosaccharide or reducing disaccharide is used to adjust the density.""

II. An opposition was filed against the grant of the patent. The grounds for opposition cited were lack of novelty and lack of inventive step (Article 100 a) EPC), insufficient disclosure (Article 100 b) EPC), and impermissible extension of content (Article 100 c) EPC).

III. The Opposition Division decided that the patent met the requirements of the EPC in an amended form based on the first auxiliary request. This decision was based on the main request submitted on June 20, 2018 (submitted as ""Auxiliary Request 7"") and an auxiliary request submitted during the oral proceedings on June 25, 2018. The auxiliary request contained 7 claims, with independent claims 1 and 7 reading as follows:

V. The Opposition Division stated in its decision, in particular, the following:

a) The skilled person could prepare a composition according to the claims based on the information in the contested patent and their general technical knowledge.

b) Claim 1 of the main request was not novel in view of A5 and A18. The public accessibility of A5 was credibly established. A5/A6 and A18 disclosed compositions containing at least one dye according to claim 1 of the main request. Furthermore, all means of the examples from A18 were suitable for adjusting the density. A70 further demonstrated that the mentioned solutions had the claimed density value and osmolality.

c) The novelty of the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 was not questioned. The closest prior art was A5. The subject matter of auxiliary request 1 differed from the preparations of A5 by using a neutral polymer as a means for adjusting the density. No effect was shown in the patent for this difference. The underlying technical problem of the patent was therefore to provide alternative staining solutions advantageous with respect to density and osmolality. Neither A5 nor the other cited documents gave the skilled person reason to replace cooling as a means for adjusting the density from A5 with a chemical component - let alone a neutral polymer.

VI. The patent owner (Appellant 1) and Opponent 2 (Appellant 2) filed appeals against the above decision.

VII. With the statement of grounds of appeal dated November 30, 2018, Appellant 1 (patent owner) submitted a main request, with the claims corresponding to those of the main request submitted during the oral proceedings before the Opposition Division, as well as 13 auxiliary requests, with auxiliary request 12 corresponding to the auxiliary request maintained in the first instance.

VIII. The content of the claims on which the present decision is based is as follows:

Claim 1 of the main request reads:

""1. Water-based, biocompatible preparation for use in surgical treatment of the eye, comprising the selective staining of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and/or epiretinal membranes (ERM) in the human or animal eye and removal of the stained membrane, containing at least one dye selected from the group consisting of: triphenylmethane dyes, cyanine dyes, and/or natural dyes or mixtures thereof, wherein the preparation has a density in the range of 1.01 g/cm**(3) to 1.5 g/cm**(3), and wherein no monosaccharide or reducing disaccharide is used to adjust the density, characterized in that the preparation contains a means for adjusting the density, and that the osmolarity of the prepared solutions is in the range of 280-330 mosmol/L.""

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 10 is based on claim 1 of the main request, with the list of dyes restricted to ""triphenylmethane dyes.""

The independent claims of auxiliary request 11 read:

""1. Water-based, biocompatible preparation for use in surgical treatment of the eye, comprising the selective staining of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and/or epiretinal membranes (ERM) in the human or animal eye and removal of the stained membrane, containing at least one dye selected from the group consisting of: triphenylmethane dyes, wherein the preparation has a density in the range of 1.01 g/cm**(3) to 1.5 g/cm**(3), and wherein no monosaccharide or reducing disaccharide is used to adjust the density, characterized in that the preparation contains a means for adjusting the density, wherein the means is a non-reducing disaccharide, a polysaccharide, or a neutral polymer or a combination thereof, and that the osmolarity of the prepared solutions is in the range of 280-330 mosmol/L.""

""7. Water-based, biocompatible preparation for in vivo selective staining of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and/or epiretinal membranes (ERM) in the human or animal eye, containing at least one triphenylmethane dye, wherein the preparation contains a means for adjusting a density in the range of 1.01 g/cm**(3) to 1.5 g/cm**(3), and wherein no monosaccharide or reducing disaccharide is used to adjust the density, wherein the means is a non-reducing disaccharide, a polysaccharide, or a neutral polymer or a combination thereof, characterized in that the osmolarity of the prepared solutions is in the range of 280-330 mosmol/L.""

X. An oral hearing took place before the Board on October 11, 2021.

XI. Appellant 1 (patent owner) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent on the basis of the main request submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal. Alternatively, it requested the maintenance of the patent on the basis of one of the auxiliary requests 1-11 submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal, the auxiliary request maintained by the Opposition Division (auxiliary request 12 in the appeal proceedings), or the auxiliary request 13 also submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal.

XII. Appellant 2 (Opponent 2) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

It further requested that auxiliary requests 1-11 and 13 not be admitted into the appeal proceedings.

XIII. The relevant arguments of Appellant 1 (patent owner) can be summarized as follows:

a) The main request meets the requirements of Article 54 EPC. Evidence A5 was not publicly accessible before the effective date of the contested patent. Furthermore, the disclosures of A5/A6 and A18 were not detrimental to the novelty of the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request. Several claimed features, particularly the density-adjusting means and the osmolarity and density values, were not described therein and could not be derived from the further cited documents A9 and A70.

b) Auxiliary requests 1-11 and 13 were submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal in direct response to the decision of the Opposition Division. They could not have been submitted earlier. In particular, the claimed subject matter in the first auxiliary request submitted during the oral proceedings before the Opposition Division was significantly restricted for procedural economy reasons. Therefore, auxiliary requests 1-11 and 13 should be admitted into the proceedings.

c) Auxiliary request 10 meets the requirements of Article 54 EPC for the same reasons as the main request.

d) The contested patent contained a precise guidance for executing the claimed subject matter. The test results submitted by Appellant 2 could not conclusively prove that the claimed subject matter was not executable. Auxiliary request 11 meets the requirements of Article 83 EPC.

e) The attack of lack of inventive step based on A5 in combination with A49 was late-filed and should therefore not be admitted into the proceedings.

f) Document A20 was not publicly accessible before the effective date of the contested patent.

g) Based on A5, the subject matter of the claims of auxiliary request 11 was not obvious, as the prior art provided no hint towards the claimed density-adjusting means. Therefore, auxiliary request 11 meets the requirements of Article 56 EPC.

XIV. The relevant arguments of Appellant 2 (Opponent) can be summarized as follows:

a) Claim 1 of the main request was not novel in view of A5/A6 and A18 in light of A9 and A70. The public accessibility of A5 was further evidenced.

b) Auxiliary requests 1-11 and 13 should not be admitted into the proceedings due to their high number and lack of convergence. The deletion of claims in auxiliary requests 9, 10, 11, and 13 further violated Rule 80 EPC.

c) Auxiliary request 10 was not novel in view of A5/A6 and A18 for the same reasons as the main request.

d) Auxiliary request 11 does not meet the requirements of Article 83 EPC. The contested patent did not provide sufficient information regarding the density-adjusting means to fulfill both claimed parameters (i.e., osmolality and density) simultaneously. In this context, the reworking of examples 5-6 of the contested patent (see A77-A78) demonstrated that even the solutions described in the contested patent did not fulfill both parameters. Finally, the lack of specification of the measurement temperature of the density, which was essential for defining the parameter, led to insufficient disclosure.

e) The attack of lack of inventive step based on A5 in combination with A49 should be admitted into the proceedings.

f) A21 and A23 evidenced that A20 was publicly accessible before the effective date of the contested patent. A20 thus belonged to the relevant prior art.

g) Based on A5, the subject matter of the claims of auxiliary request 11 was obvious, as A21 provided a hint towards the use of methylcellulose as a density-adjusting means. Therefore, the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 11 was not inventive.","Reasons for the Decision

Main Request

1. Novelty

In the appeal proceedings, the appellant 2 challenged the novelty of claim 1 of the main request in view of A5/A6 and A18.

1.2 A5/A6

1.2.1 Public Accessibility

The evidence A5 is a video (A5 video) of a presentation that contains a video presentation produced by Mr. Martin K. Schmid. Document A6 is its written transcription. To assess whether the A5 video was made publicly accessible before the effective date of the contested patent and thus actually belongs to the state of the art (Article 54(2) EPC), it must first be established when and how the A5 video was made accessible to the public.

According to appellant 2, the A5 video is a recording of the presentation given by Mr. Martin K. Schmid at the 8th European Vitreoretinal Society (EVRS) Congress. From the printout of the EVRS Congress website (A8), it can be inferred that Mr. Martin K. Schmid gave a presentation on September 8, 2008 (see Congress program) and that a video (""A8 video"") with the same title was made accessible on the aforementioned website by Mr. Martin K. Schmid on October 1, 2008 (see A8 ""posted on Oct 1, 2008""). Disclosures on the internet are considered publicly accessible from the moment they are published online. Generally, it must be assessed whether the documents belong to the state of the art based on a weighing of probabilities. Consequently, in the present case, it is credible that the A8 video was publicly accessible on October 1, 2008. Given the title of the A8 video, the accompanying Congress program, as well as Mr. Martin K. Schmid's statement (see A58A) and in the absence of counter-evidence, the chamber further finds it credible that the A8 video is indeed the A5 video.

In this context, appellant 1 argued that the said website was first accessible according to ""Wayback Machine"" results in 2013 (see F76), so that the A8 video was not publicly accessible before 2013. The chamber cannot agree with this opinion. As stated in the 9th edition of the case law of the Boards of Appeal I.C.3.2.3 c) (ii), it is ""the recognized policy of the Internet Archive 'Wayback Machine' to crawl the internet and archive the crawled pages."" It is therefore common knowledge that despite a very high data volume, the archive remains an incomplete collection of previous web pages. Consequently, a date obtained via the Wayback Machine generally allows for a credible conclusion that the researched website was indeed accessible at least at that time. However, it cannot be conclusively derived from this that the website was not already accessible earlier and simply had not yet been crawled by the archive.

Finally, the argument of appellant 1 that A5 is a brief presentation of information and therefore there is uncertainty regarding the information received by the audience is unconvincing. The chamber notes that in the present case, the A5 video itself is to be regarded as prior art. The disclosure in this video is clear and unambiguous. Mr. Martin K. Schmid's statement (see A58A) is therefore not used as evidence for the content actually disclosed in A5.

Consequently, the chamber concludes that after weighing the probabilities, the A5 video on the website from A8 was made publicly accessible on October 1, 2008, i.e., before the filing date of the present patent.

1.2.2 Disclosure of A5/A6

A5 relates to methods for staining the internal limiting membrane during macular surgery. Staining solutions are made denser by cooling, thus achieving more efficient staining due to the sinking of the dye. Among other things, the use of a cooled Brilliant Peel® solution is described as efficient (see paragraph 1.6 of A6).

According to the data sheet of Brilliant Peel® (A9), the said solution has an osmolarity of 306 mOsm/kg and contains the following components:

(i) Brilliant Blue G, i.e., a triphenylmethane dye,

(ii) Phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4.2H2O and NaH2PO4.2H2O), and

(iii) Sodium chloride.

The chamber sees no reason to doubt that the Brilliant Peel® product used in A5 has the composition described in A9.

The chamber is of the opinion that the substances (ii) and (iii) contained alongside the dye can be regarded as density-adjusting agents. The contested patent does not provide a specific definition of the density-adjusting agent. It merely states that it should be biocompatible, i.e., non-toxic, homogeneously miscible with water, and compatible with the dye used (see paragraph [0027]). A minimum density is not specifically defined. Therefore, the substances (ii) and (iii) meet the criteria specified in the contested patent.

According to appellant 1, it cannot be assumed that the composition of the commercial product Brilliant Peel® corresponded to the composition described in A9 at the time the video was created. The composition of the commercial product may have changed between the creation of the video and the publication of A9. However, appellant 1 has not provided verifiable facts to support this argument.

The Brilliant Peel® solution mentioned in A5 thus fulfills all the structural features defined in the present claim 1 (i.e., water-based, biocompatible preparation containing a triphenylmethane dye, no monosaccharide or reducing disaccharide, a density-adjusting agent) as well as the claimed osmolarity value.

1.3 Disclosure of A18

A18 relates to the preparation of dyes for visualizing cells, particularly separating membranes in the eye, e.g., for the removal of the internal limiting membrane (see page 5, lines 13-17). A18 discloses in examples 1 and 3 compositions that contain the following components:

(i) Patent Blue V, i.e., a triphenylmethane dye,

(ii) Phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4.2H2O and NaH2PO4.2H2O) or citrate buffer (C6H5Na3O7.2H2O), and

(iii) Sodium chloride.

For the same reasons as for the dye solution from A5, the chamber is of the opinion (see point 1.2.2) that the substances (ii) and (iii) can be regarded as density-adjusting agents.

The dye solutions of examples 1 and 3 of A18 thus fulfill all the structural features defined in the present claim 1 (i.e., water-based, biocompatible preparation containing a triphenylmethane dye, no monosaccharide or reducing disaccharide, a density-adjusting agent).

1.4 Claimed Parameters (Osmolarity and Density)

However, neither A9 nor A5 specifies the density of the Brilliant Peel® solution. This composition was reworked by appellant 2, and its density at various temperatures as well as its osmolarity were measured (see A70, Table 4 and Table 7). After rounding the density values, all values fall within the claimed ranges.

A18 also does not disclose the osmolarity or density of the dye solutions from examples 1 and 3. These compositions were also reworked by appellant 2, and their density at various temperatures as well as their osmolarity were measured (see A70, Tables 1-2 and Table 5). After rounding, the density values at 15°C and 20°C fall within the claimed range. The osmolarity values fall within the claimed range.

1.4.1 Equivalence of the Solutions from A5/A18 and A70

Appellant 1 argued that the solutions produced in A70 do not correspond to the solutions from A5 and A18 for the following reasons:

(i) The temperature at which the Brilliant Peel® solution is used is not specified in A5.

(ii) A18 does not describe which ingredients the solutions from examples 1 and 3 contain. In particular, it is not described which Patent Blue V salt was used.

The chamber generally notes that the solutions reworked in A70 contain the components described in examples 1 and 3 from A18 or those described in A9 (Brilliant Peel®) in the specified amounts.

Regarding point (i), a ""cooled"" Brilliant Peel® solution was used in A5. Although the temperature at which the solution was used in A5 is not specifically disclosed, it can be directly and unambiguously inferred that it is lower than room temperature. In A70, the density of the Brilliant Peel® solution was measured at +4°C, +9°C, +13°C, +15°C, +21°C, and +23°C. As explained in A5, the density of a solution increases with decreasing temperature. If the density value for all solutions of the panel tested in A70 is met, it must therefore also generally be met in A5.

Regarding point (ii), the solutions reworked in A70 were produced using the preferred Patent Blue V salt from A18, i.e., calcium salt. As stated by appellant 1, two salts for Patent Blue V are known (calcium and sodium). However, appellant 1 did not provide an explanation as to how the use of calcium salt or sodium salt would lead to significantly different results regarding the density value. Consequently, the solutions reworked in A70 are considered representative of the solutions disclosed in examples 1 and 3 of A18.

1.4.2 Rounding of Density Values

The density value is defined in the present claim 1 with two decimal places, while in A70 the measured density values are given with four decimal places and the measurement uncertainty with five decimal places. To compare these differently expressed density values, rounding appears necessary. Rounding experimental values for comparison purposes seems to be the usual practice (see A89A-A89B).

In this context, appellant 1 argued that rounding the values disclosed in A70 would be scientifically incorrect (see F75). Furthermore, the patent does not only disclose an absolute density value (1.01-1.5 g/cm³) but also a minimum distance (0.01 g/cm³) concerning water (see paragraph [0033]). Thanks to this additional feature, it is possible to calculate the minimum required density value of the claimed solutions at a certain temperature based on the density value of water. Appellant 1 has also done this using the data in A4 and concludes that solutions with density values up to 1.007 g/cm³ are subject to the claims. According to appellant 1, for this reason, example 6 (1.007 g/cm³) of the contested patent falls within the scope of the claims, while the solutions reworked in A70, insofar as they correspond to the state of the art, do not.

This argument is unconvincing. The said minimum distance is not a feature of the claims, which clearly define an absolute density value. Therefore, referring to the description to further define this density value is not necessary. Since the density values in the examples of the contested patent are themselves given with three decimal places (i.e., more decimal places than in the claims), the claimed values are to be understood as limits that are intentionally expressed less precisely than the values measured in the examples of the contested patent. It should also be noted that appellant 1 itself based its calculation on rounded values from A4 to enable a comparison with the patent examples. Finally, F75 does not address the issue of rounding in relation to comparison with less precisely defined values, but rather the impact of rounding on the relevance of the experimental values in A70. In the present case, the adjustment of the values according to applicable mathematical rules serves only for comparison purposes and does not affect the density values disclosed in A70.

1.5 The chamber thus concludes that A5 and A18 disclose dye solutions for use in the eye, which contain the claimed dyes and density-adjusting agents and meet the claimed osmolarity and density values at a temperature corresponding to the application. The subject matter of claim 1 of the main request is therefore not novel over A5/A6 and A18 (Article 54 EPC).

Admission of Auxiliary Requests

2. Auxiliary requests 1-11 and 13 were submitted by appellant 1 with their statement of appeal on November 30, 2018. Their admission is therefore to be assessed according to Article 12(4) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal 2007 (RPBA 2007) (Article 25(2) RPBA 2020).

3. Auxiliary Requests 1-9

3.1 The fundamental question regarding the admission of auxiliary requests 1-9 is less the issue of divergence raised by appellant 2, but rather the question of the possible earlier submission of the auxiliary requests. Article 12(4) RPBA 2007 gives the chamber discretion to not admit requests that should have been presented or maintained in the first-instance proceedings. The background of Article 12(4) RPBA 2007 is the aim that requests should first be assessed by the opposition division before the appeal board as a second instance judges the decision of the opposition division. On the other hand, a party should also be given the opportunity to respond to points that only became apparent through the decision. The subject matter in the second instance can therefore only be changed to a limited extent by the parties.

3.2 In the present case, auxiliary requests 1-6 correspond to the auxiliary requests 2A-2C and 3C-3E submitted in the opposition proceedings, with the feature of osmolarity added. This feature was already considered a useful amendment by appellant 1 in the opposition proceedings, as it was added in the main request (originally submitted as auxiliary request 7) and in the auxiliary request submitted during the oral proceedings before the opposition division (i.e., the current auxiliary request 12). The present auxiliary requests 1-6 should therefore have been submitted in the opposition proceedings. This also seemed to be the original intention of appellant 1 (see minutes of the oral proceedings before the opposition division, page 1, section 2: ""Rather, the patent proprietor expresses their willingness to understand that these requests"" (i.e., auxiliary requests 1-6) ""may be adjusted with the same limitations as in auxiliary request 7""). Instead, essential features of these claims were abandoned by not pursuing auxiliary requests 2A-C and 3C-E in the opposition proceedings, as the 7th auxiliary request became the main request and subsequently a new further restricted auxiliary request was submitted as the first auxiliary request.

3.3 The present auxiliary requests 7-9 each contain independent claims or claims for a kit that had already been deleted in the auxiliary request submitted during the oral proceedings before the opposition division. By submitting the auxiliary request during the oral proceedings before the opposition division (i.e., the current auxiliary request 12), appellant 1 limited themselves to a smaller number of claims and thereby avoided a decision of the opposition division regarding the said claims. Appellant 1 thus consciously took a procedural action that was determinative for the further proceedings and was solely their responsibility. Auxiliary requests 7, 8, and 9 should therefore also have been submitted in the opposition proceedings.

3.4 In response to the question of the possible earlier submission of the present auxiliary requests discussed during the oral proceedings, appellant 1 argued that the submission of a heavily restricted auxiliary request during the oral proceedings before the opposition division was due to procedural economic reasons considering the late hour. Furthermore, the changes made in the present auxiliary requests would follow the same line as the changes made in the auxiliary request submitted before the opposition division. These arguments are unconvincing, as they are not relevant for the assessment of admission according to Article 12(4) RPBA 2007, as detailed above (see points 3.1-3.3). The chamber notes for completeness that according to the minutes of the oral proceedings before the opposition division, the auxiliary request was submitted immediately after the opposition division announced its opinion regarding the lack of novelty of the main request at 14:39 (see page 4 of the minutes), so that no time pressure is apparent.

3.5 Auxiliary requests 1-9 are therefore not admitted into the proceedings (Article 12(4) RPBA 2007).

4. Auxiliary Requests 10, 11, and 13

4.1 Appellant 2 generally criticized the lack of convergence within the auxiliary requests. During the oral proceedings, they further argued that auxiliary requests 10, 11, and 13 did not meet the requirements of Rule 80 EPC because deletions of claims had been made that were not prompted by any ground for opposition.

4.2 The present auxiliary requests 10, 11, and 13 were submitted in response to the decision of the Board of Appeal regarding the lack of novelty of the main request. A clear structure is also recognizable within these auxiliary requests (same limitation of the dye and convergent limitation of the density-adjusting agent). Furthermore, Rule 80 EPC provides that patent claims may be amended as long as the amendments are prompted by a ground for opposition under Article 100 EPC, even if this has not been asserted by the opponent. The present limitations of claim sets, particularly through the deletion of entire claims, can per se be regarded as a serious attempt to address a ground for opposition and are therefore formally admissible under Rule 80 EPC.

4.3 Finally, the claims that were deleted in the auxiliary request submitted during the oral proceedings before the opposition division were also deleted in the present auxiliary requests 10, 11, and 13. The argumentation set out in point 3.3 therefore does not apply to these auxiliary requests.

4.4 In the chamber's opinion, auxiliary requests 10, 11, and 13 represent a legitimate and direct response to the first-instance decision.

4.5 The chamber therefore sees no reason to exercise its discretion under Article 12(4) RPBA 2007 to exclude auxiliary requests 10, 11, and 13 from the appeal proceedings. Auxiliary requests 10, 11, and 13 are therefore part of the appeal proceedings.

Auxiliary Request 10

5. Novelty

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 10 differs from claim 1 of the main request by limiting the dye to triphenylmethane dyes. Since the compositions cited against novelty from A5/A6 and A18 each contain a triphenylmethane dye (Brilliant Blue G in A5/A6 and Patent Blue V in A18), the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 10 is not novel over A5/A6 and A18 (Article 54 EPC) for the same reasons as stated for the main request (see point 1).

Auxiliary Request 11

6. Amendments

6.1 Auxiliary request 11 is based on the main request, wherein:

- the density-adjusting agent was restricted by introducing the feature ""a non-reducing disaccharide, a polysaccharide, or a neutral polymer or a combination thereof"" disclosed on original page 5, and

- the dye was restricted to a triphenylmethane dye through deletions. The same changes were also made in independent claim 7 of auxiliary request 11.

6.2 Appellant 2 raised no objections under Article 123(2) and 123(3) EPC. The chamber considers the requirements of Articles 123(2) and 123(3) EPC for auxiliary request 11 to be fulfilled.

7. Novelty

7.1 Claim 1 of auxiliary request 11 differs from claim 1 of auxiliary request 10 in that the density-adjusting agent is defined as ""a non-reducing disaccharide, a polysaccharide, or a neutral polymer or a combination thereof."" The same change was also made in independent claim 7 of auxiliary request 11.

7.2 Appellant 2 raised no objections under Article 54 EPC. The chamber considers the requirements of Article 54 EPC for auxiliary request 11 to be fulfilled.

8. Sufficient Disclosure

8.1 The independent claims of auxiliary request 11 relate to a water-based biocompatible composition for surgical/in vivo use in the eye containing at least one triphenylmethane dye and a density-adjusting agent selected from a non-reducing disaccharide, a polysaccharide, or a neutral polymer or a combination thereof, wherein the composition has a certain density and a certain osmolarity.

8.2 The execution of the surgical/in vivo use in the eye by selectively staining the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and/or epiretinal membranes (ERM) was not disputed in the appeal proceedings.

8.3 The claimed composition per se was defined by the following features:

(i) essential chemical components (i.e., water, dye, density-adjusting agent),

(ii) the functional feature ""biocompatible,"" and

(iii) two parameters, namely specific density and osmolarity.

8.3.1 The fact that the skilled person can prepare a solution containing the claimed essential chemical components (feature (i)) was not questioned.

8.3.2 Regarding the functional feature ""biocompatible"" (feature (ii)), appellant 2 merely stated in the appeal proceedings that it was a wish without disclosing the means to fulfill it. The chamber notes, however, that appellant 2 did not provide any evidence that a biocompatible solution according to the claims could not be prepared. The chamber therefore shares the opinion of the opposition division that the skilled person could determine the type and amount of components that would meet the requirement of biocompatibility without undue burden.

8.3.3 Concerning the achievement of the claimed parameter values (feature (iii)), particularly the osmolarity value, the chamber notes that a general description along with specific examples of the claimed essential components as well as additional suitable components is disclosed in the contested patent (see paragraphs [0026]-[0027], [0029]-[0031], and [0034]-[0039]). The contested patent also teaches changing the amount of the density-adjusting agent to achieve the claimed density (see paragraph [0032]). Several composition examples with various claimed density-adjusting agents that all achieve the claimed density are also described (see examples 1-2 and 5-6). The feasibility of adjusting the osmolarity is also discussed in paragraph [0027]. However, the osmolarity of the solutions was not specified in the examples. Nevertheless, the chamber believes that it seems possible for the skilled person to determine through routine work and experimentation whether a certain solution has the claimed osmolarity or not, and if necessary, to adjust the type and/or amount of the density-adjusting agent. Finally, appellant 1 referred to A39 and A10 during the oral proceedings. The chamber notes that the claimed solutions from A39 (see Tables 4-5 on pages 6-7, solutions with BBG and HA1, HPMC1 or HPMC2) and A10 (see Table 4, solution number 19) meet the claimed density and osmolarity values.

8.4 The chamber thus concludes that the skilled person can carry out the subject matter of the claims of auxiliary request 11 based on the information in the contested patent and through routine work and experimentation.

8.5 Regarding the arguments of appellant 2, the following is noted:

8.5.1 Appellant 2 argued that the contested patent would not provide sufficient information regarding the density-adjusting agents to be used. Appellant 2 reworked solutions according to examples 5-6 of the contested patent and measured their osmolarity (see A77, table on page 6 and A78, table 2). Since these do not meet the claimed value, appellant 2 concluded that the subject matter of the present auxiliary request is not executable. During the oral proceedings, appellant 2 also referred to A54, particularly the table on page 6 and the results regarding solutions with saccharides. Appellant 2 argued that the osmolarity of the said solutions is so far from the claimed range that, in order to adjust the osmolarity, the density would necessarily no longer fall within the claimed range. According to appellant 2, solutions that exhibit the claimed density and osmolarity cannot be produced based on the teaching of the contested patent. The scope of the claims thus does not correspond to the teaching of the contested patent.

However, this argument is unconvincing for the following reasons:

a) As stated by appellant 1, A77 shows a clear trend regarding osmolarity in the case of PVP as a density-adjusting agent (i.e., according to example 5 of the contested patent): the higher the molecular weight of PVP, the lower the osmolarity of the solution. The skilled person would thus have determined through routine experiments that PVP with a higher molecular weight should be used.

b) The osmolarity value for the methylcellulose-containing solution (i.e., according to example 6 of the contested patent) in A77 is 333+/-1.5 mOsm/l, i.e., it actually lies between 331.5 mOsm/l and 334.5 mOsm/l. The claimed value goes up to a maximum of 330 mOsm/l. Both values are therefore close to each other. Furthermore, the osmolarity value measured for the apparently identical solution (same reference number as in A77) in A78 under identical conditions is 380+/-1.0 mOsm/l. The significant difference (certainly greater than the accuracy range) between the values from A77 and A78 calls into question the credibility of the results from A77 and A78. Consequently, it is at least doubtful that a solution according to example 6 does not correspond to the subject matter of the main request.

c) The fact that individual examples do not meet the claimed values does not necessarily mean that the claimed subject matter is not executable. In this context, the chamber notes that the argument of appellant 2 regarding the solutions from A54 was not experimentally substantiated.

Therefore, the test results submitted by appellant 2 do not indicate that the skilled person could not have executed the subject matter of the present auxiliary request.

8.5.2 During the oral proceedings, appellant 2 raised the further argument that the lack of specification of the temperature at which the claimed density is to be measured in the present claims would lead to insufficient disclosure. The said temperature is indeed an essential feature that has a direct impact on the density value. The lack of specification of the measurement temperature is therefore a matter of executability and not merely of clarity. It could also not be assumed that the measurement temperature is that of the surgical intervention room. It is known (see, for example, A5/A6) that cooled solutions can be used.

The chamber cannot share this viewpoint. The skilled person would infer from the contested patent that the claimed solutions are to be used at the usual temperature of a surgical intervention in the eye. It is indeed not mentioned in the contested patent that the solutions are to be cooled. Consequently, the skilled person would understand that the density of the claimed solutions is to be measured at the said temperature. As explained by appellant 1 during the oral proceedings, it can be assumed according to A5/A6 that the temperature of the intraocular fluid during a vitrectomy is around 23°C. As also explained by appellant 1 during the oral proceedings, the statements F47, F48, and F49 further demonstrate that the usual temperature of the dye solutions used during a vitrectomy corresponds to the temperature of the operating room, i.e., 17-26°C. The fact that in exceptional cases, lower temperatures are used in other methods, such as in an embodiment from A5/A6, is not relevant for the reworking of the claimed solutions. The chamber further notes that appellant 2 itself measured the density of the reworked solutions in their experimental tests at 23°C (see, for example, A77 or A54). The chamber thus concludes that the lack of specification of the temperature in the present claims does not raise an issue under Article 83 EPC.

8.6 The claims of auxiliary request 11 therefore fulfill the requirements of Article 83 EPC.

9. Inventive Step

9.1 Admission of the new attack based on A5 in combination with A49

9.1.1 During the oral proceedings, appellant 2 raised an objection of lack of inventive step based on A5 in combination with A49. Appellant 2 stated that this objection was already included in the notice of opposition but did not cite any specific paragraph. Appellant 2 further stated that the statement of appeal included a reference to the notice of opposition and mentioned A49 in connection with the question of inventive step under point 11.1. Appellant 1 requested that this late objection not be admitted into the proceedings.

9.1.2 The chamber notes the following:

(i) A49 is mentioned in connection with the question of inventive step in the notice of opposition. However, an argument based on the combination of A49 with A5 as the closest prior art was not found in the notice of opposition. Moreover, it is noted that mere general references to earlier submissions (see, for example, in connection with the auxiliary requests, point 8 of the appeal response) cannot be considered as fulfilling the requirement established in Article 12(3) RPBA 2020, which states that all facts, objections, arguments, and evidence must be explicitly and specifically stated.

(ii) Under point 11.1 of the statement of appeal, it is merely stated that A49 was not considered by the opposition division as a possible closest prior art. An argument based on A49 was not detailed.

9.1.3 The chamber therefore concludes that the present objection was raised for the very first time during the oral proceedings on October 11, 2021, and thus constitutes a change in the submissions of appellant 2.

9.1.4 Article 13(2) RPBA 2020, which applies in the present case according to Article 25(1) RPBA 2020, states that such changes at this time ""are generally not to be taken into account unless the party concerned has shown compelling reasons that exceptional circumstances exist."" In the present case, appellant 2 did not provide any exceptional circumstances, let alone compelling reasons. In this context, it should be noted that the number of auxiliary requests mentioned by appellant 2 does not constitute exceptional circumstances in the present case, particularly since the said auxiliary requests were already submitted with the statement of appeal and do not raise a new case.

9.1.5 The attack on inventive step based on A5 in combination with A49 is therefore not admitted into the proceedings (Article 13(2) RPBA 2020).

9.2 Public Accessibility of A20

9.2.1 A20 was cited by appellant 2 in their objection of lack of inventive step. According to appellant 2, the poster reproduced in A20 was made publicly accessible during the conference of the ""The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO)"" in April 2004. As evidence for this, they referred to abstract A21 and a statement from an author of A20 (see A23). Appellant 1 disputed the public accessibility of A20.

9.2.2 The chamber notes that A20 itself does not contain any indication of any public display during any conference.

9.2.3 According to appellant 2, A21 represents the abstract of the poster that was displayed during the said conference. The important feature in A20 for the present case is the glucose-free dye solution containing methylcellulose and Trypan Blue. However, this feature cannot be directly and unambiguously derived from abstract A21. In this context, the chamber notes that the reference in the ""Methods"" section of A21 to ""diluted with varying concentrations of glucose solution"" cannot be considered as a clear disclosure of a glucose-free solution. A21 cannot therefore unequivocally prove that the poster displayed during the said conference is indeed the poster depicted in A20.

9.2.4 In her statement (see A23), Ms. Lesnik-Oberstein (""Ms. L."") states that the poster depicted in A20 (referred to as ""A34"" in A23 because A23 was originally submitted in another proceeding) corresponds to the poster presented during the said conference. According to the said statement, the glucose-free dye solution containing methylcellulose and Trypan Blue was also discussed in the context of the poster presentation. However, this written statement from Ms. L. was not supported by any further independent evidence. Furthermore, it was undisputed among the parties that there is another version of the poster (see F66; referred to as ""Annex UN23"" in A23 because A23 was originally submitted in another proceeding). Ms. L. explains in A23 that this other version was a non-final version of the poster. This seems credible, as F66 has significantly less content. However, it cannot be ruled out that Ms. L. may have honestly misremembered the content of the poster, however limited it may have been, especially since the conference was nine years prior to her statement and various versions of the poster were produced.

9.2.5 Appellant 2 confirmed during the oral proceedings that in the present case, Ms. L. was neither offered as a witness in the opposition proceedings nor in the appeal proceedings. Therefore, a witness examination that could have allowed for the verification of the accuracy of Ms. L.'s memories could not take place in the present case.

9.2.6 After weighing all the available facts and evidence, the chamber is not convinced that A20 was publicly accessible at the relevant time.

9.3 Inventive Step starting from A5

9.3.1 Both parties agree that A5 is considered the closest prior art. A5 discloses heavy glucose-free dye solutions and their use for selectively staining eye membranes during a vitrectomy. The disclosed dye solutions contain dyes according to the present claims and meet the claimed osmolarity and density values (see 4.). The density of the said solutions is increased by cooling the solutions.

9.3.2 The subject matter of the claims of auxiliary request 11 differs from the solutions disclosed in A5 by the type of density-adjusting agent. This was not disputed by the parties.

9.3.3 No particular effect was demonstrated over the glucose-free solutions from A5. Consequently, the objective technical problem is to provide alternative glucose-free dye solutions for the selective staining of the ILM and/or ERM.

9.3.4 Appellant 2 argued that A21 provided a hint towards the use of methylcellulose as an alternative to cooling to increase the density of the solutions. To solve the present problem, it would therefore have seemed obvious to the skilled person to add methylcellulose (i.e., a neutral polymer) to the solutions of A5 instead of cooling them.

9.3.5 This argument is unconvincing. As already stated in point 9.2.3, a disclosure of a glucose-free methylcellulose-containing solution from A21 is not directly and unambiguously derivable.

9.4 The claims of auxiliary request 11 therefore fulfill the requirements of Article 56 EPC.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is revoked. 2.

III. In the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged under Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty and lack of inventive step. The patent owner subsequently defended the patent in a limited version. According to the opposition division, this version met the requirements of the EPC. In particular, novelty was considered to be present over D1-D3, and the claimed compositions were not suggested based on D5.

IV. In her statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant argued that the independent claims of the version of the patent maintained by the opposition division lacked novelty in view of the newly submitted documents D11 and D12. Furthermore, the claimed compositions were suggested to the skilled person based on D4; D4 represented the closest prior art, not D5, as assumed by the opposition division. She therefore requested the revocation of the patent.

V. In her response to the appeal, the respondent argued that the newly submitted documents D11 and D12 should have been submitted during the opposition proceedings and should therefore not be admitted into the proceedings under Article 12(4) RPBA 2007. Furthermore, they were not detrimental to novelty. Inventive step was present based on D5, as established in the opposition decision. Inventive step was also present based on D4, considering this document as the closest prior art. The respondent therefore requested that the appeal be dismissed.

VI. On December 3, 2020, the parties were informed in a communication under Rule 100(2) EPC about the preliminary assessment of the factual and legal situation by the Board. The parties were given a period of four months for any responses.

The Board was preliminarily of the opinion that D11 and D12 should not be admitted into the proceedings. It considered novelty and inventive step to be present.

VII. In a letter dated April 1, 2021, the appellant submitted the test report D13. She argued that the results of this test report demonstrated that there was no inventive step.

VIII. In a letter dated April 7, 2021, the respondent requested that the test report D13 no longer be admitted into the appeal proceedings.

IX. By summons dated April 12, 2021, an oral hearing was scheduled for June 24, 2021.

X. In a letter dated June 21, 2021, the appellant submitted documents D14-D18. She argued that these documents served to reinforce the novelty objection based on D11.

XI. The oral hearing took place on June 24, 2021.

During the oral hearing, the issues of the admission of documents D11-D18, novelty, and inventive step were addressed.

At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.

XII. The final requests of the parties were:

The appellant (opponent) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of European Patent No. 2276452.

The respondent (patent owner) requested the dismissal of the appeal and thus the maintenance of the patent in the version upheld by the opposition division. She also requested that documents D11-D18 not be admitted into the proceedings.

XIII. The essential arguments of the parties are outlined and addressed in the reasons for the decision.

XIV. The independent claim of the patent in the version maintained by the opposition division reads:

Cosmetic preparation in the form of an emulsion or dispersion containing

a) 2-(4'-Diethylamino-2'-hydroxybenzoyl)-benzoic acid hexyl ester and

b) Citronellol,

which is free from glucosylglyceride (glycerylglucose), wherein

the preparation contains one or more additional UV filters chosen from the group of compounds (...) [Note of the Board: A longer list of possible UV filters follows]

wherein the total concentration of fragrance substances in the preparation is from 0.00001 to 1%, based on the weight of the preparation.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

However, it is not successful, as will be explained below.

2. Admission of Documents D11-D18 into the Appeal Proceedings

D11 and D12 were submitted with the statement of appeal to demonstrate a lack of novelty. D14-D18 were submitted later in the proceedings to reinforce the novelty objection based on D11. D13 is an experimental report intended to demonstrate a lack of inventive step.

2.1 D11 and D12

2.1.1 Since D11 and D12 were submitted with the statement of appeal, prior to the entry into force of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA) from 2020, the admission of these documents is governed by Article 12(4) RPBA 2007. This is stipulated in the transitional provisions in Article 25(2) RPBA 2020.

According to Article 12(4) RPBA 2007, it is at the discretion of the Board to not admit facts, evidence, or requests that could have been presented in the first-instance proceedings or that were not admitted there.

2.1.2 The amended claims on the basis of which the patent was maintained were submitted by the patent proprietor with the response to the notice of opposition on December 4, 2017, i.e., ten months before the scheduled date of the oral proceedings in the opposition proceedings, which were subsequently canceled following the withdrawal of the request for oral proceedings by the opponent and current appellant. In the annex to the summons for oral proceedings, the opposition division explained why the patent could be maintained based on these amended claims. The appellant did not respond to this assessment.

2.1.3 The Board is of the opinion that D11 and D12, as additional documents that the appellant believes question the novelty of the claims ultimately maintained in the opposition proceedings, could not only have been submitted in the opposition proceedings but must have been submitted there.

This would have been permissible at the latest in response to the summons from the opposition division for oral proceedings, which had indicated the possibility of maintaining the patent based on the amended documents. In response, the appellant did not raise any further objections but withdrew the request for oral proceedings. No further substantial submissions were made, including in response to the communications from the opposition division regarding the adaptation of the description to the claims deemed allowable.

The Board therefore sees no justification in the present case for introducing additional allegedly novelty-destroying documents only in the context of an appeal procedure.

2.1.4 The appellant has justified the late submission of these documents in the appeal proceedings by stating that they are prima facie relevant and should therefore be admitted to avoid maintaining a patent that is not legally valid.

2.1.5 The Board cannot agree with this view. Even assuming, which does not need to be further discussed here, that prima facie relevance is a criterion for the admission of documents under Article 12(4) RPBA 2007, the Board does not recognize such relevance.

It is clear from the appeal brief (see points 4.1 and 4.2) that the individual features of the independent claim of the maintained version can only be assembled from lists disclosed at various points in the description by extracting them. There is no reference to a specific disclosure of novelty-destroying compositions. The day creams on pages 84 and 85 of D11 are cited to illustrate typical concentration ranges of fragrance substances, not as novelty-destroying examples in themselves.

It is therefore not apparent to the Board that these documents are prima facie, i.e., at first glance, novelty-destroying.

2.1.6 In response to this position of the Board, the appellant argued that the (even later) submitted documents D14-D18 demonstrate, through a closer examination of the fragrance substances used in D11, that the day creams on pages 84/85 of D11 are novelty-destroying for the maintained claims.

2.1.7 Notwithstanding various questions raised by the respondent regarding the content of documents D14-D18, their admission into the proceedings, and the fact that some of these documents are not pre-published, the Board finds that the mere fact that secondary documents are needed for a possibly novelty-destroying interpretation of D11 is further evidence that D11 is not prima facie relevant.

2.1.8 Therefore, D11 and D12 are not admitted into the appeal proceedings.

2.2 D14-D18

2.2.1 These documents were submitted on June 21, 2021, i.e., three days before the oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal.

Their admission is therefore governed by Article 13(2) RPBA 2020. According to this provision, changes to a party's appeal case after the issuance of a communication under Rule 100(2) EPC or after the summons for oral proceedings is generally disregarded. Exceptions require compelling reasons for the existence of exceptional circumstances.

In the present case, these documents were submitted after the issuance of a communication under Rule 100(2) EPC, after the deadline for responding to this communication had expired, and after the summons for oral proceedings had been issued.

2.2.2 The appellant argued that these documents were first identified by them on June 17, 2021, i.e., one week before the date of the oral proceedings. They clearly demonstrate, through a closer examination of fragrance substances, that the examples on pages 84/85 of D11 are novelty-destroying. Therefore, there is no deliberate tactical or abusive motivation on the part of the appellant.

The Board does not wish to dispute the latter. However, Article 13(2) RPBA 2020 requires the existence of exceptional circumstances for changes to the appeal case at such a late stage. Such circumstances have not been convincingly demonstrated by the appellant. A search for such documents could have been conducted earlier. The fact that the Board did not intend to admit D11 and D12 into the proceedings in its communication under Rule 100(2) EPC and did not find the objections based on them convincing is also not an exceptional circumstance under Article 13(2) RPBA 2020, especially since the four-month response period set in that communication was not even adhered to.

The appellant's reference to prima facie relevance is also unavailing. Even if, which is not to be decided here, this criterion were to take precedence over the conditions of Article 13(2) RPBA 2020, such relevance is not present in the current case. These documents would only be relevant to the novelty question in combination with D11, not on their own. Moreover, they contain no reference to this document, so it is not even clear whether identical ingredients were examined. There is certainly no prima facie relevance in the sense that these documents would lead to the revocation of the patent upon superficial examination.

2.2.3 Therefore, D14-D18 are not admitted into the proceedings under Article 13(2) RPBA 2020.

2.3 D13

2.3.1 D13 was submitted with the response to the Board's communication under Rule 100(2) EPC. The criteria of Article 13(2) RPBA 2020 also apply here.

D13 contains comparative experiments intended to cast doubt on the inventive step of the claims.

2.3.2 The appellant has argued that the submission of this experiment at such a late stage is justified as a reaction to the Board's communication under Rule 100(2) EPC. There are also exceptional circumstances, as these experiments show the opposite of what has been assumed in the proceedings so far and support the objection that the comparative experiment in the patent is insufficient for the breadth of the claims regarding the UV filters. The patent must be revoked due to this new situation.

2.3.3 The Board cannot recognize any exceptional circumstances that would justify the submission of D13 at this stage of the proceedings.

Inventive step was acknowledged in the opposition decision with reference to the comparative experiment contained in the contested patent (paragraph [0071]), see point 3 of the reasons for the decision. This issue had already been extensively discussed in the opposition proceedings. In the summons for oral proceedings before the opposition division, it was noted that the comparative experiment was valid as a basis for acknowledging inventive step. This preliminary opinion was adopted in the decision since the appellant did not present anything further in the opposition proceedings. The submission of D13 is therefore not a reaction to any new objection from the Board of Appeal but relates to a fact that has been disputed since the opposition proceedings.

2.3.4 The fact that the appellant believes that the patent should be revoked based on the data in D13 cannot be considered an exceptional circumstance in the sense of Article 13(2) RPBA 2020.

On the one hand, such reasoning would apply to any late submission by an opponent in the appeal proceedings, which would render the provisions of Article 114(2) EPC and the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal meaningless.

On the other hand, it is also not the case that the experiments would clearly lead to the revocation of the patent. The respondent rightly pointed out that the experiments in D13 only contain data on the influence of temperature during storage, but not on light stability, and the formulations of the compositions appear unclear due to the repeated indication of ""qs"" for individual components. Even assuming that the data actually contradicted the comparative experiment of the patent, the interpretation of such experimental results by the parties and their impact on the patentability requirements under the EPC would still be subject to the Board's assessment of evidence. Therefore, one cannot speak of a clear situation.

2.3.5 Therefore, D13 is not admitted into the appeal proceedings under Article 13(2) RPBA 2020.

3. Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

3.1 The opposition division acknowledged the novelty of the amended claims over the documents cited in the opposition proceedings D1-D3, see point 2 of the contested decision.

This finding was not challenged by the appellant, and the Board sees no reason to doubt this decision of the opposition division.

3.2 The further documents cited by the appellant, D11, D12, and D14-D20, are not part of the proceedings, as stated above.

3.3 Therefore, novelty is given.

4. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

4.1 The claims relate to cosmetic preparations in the form of an emulsion or dispersion. In particular, these compositions contain the substance 2-(4'-Diethylamino-2'-hydroxybenzoyl)-benzoic acid ethyl ester (component (a) of claim 1), which can lead to the cosmetic compositions containing it losing their fragrance prematurely, see paragraph [0004] of the contested patent. This loss of fragrance is to be counteracted by including Citronellol (component (b) of claim 1) in the composition along with one or more other UV filters. The patent contains a comparative experiment in paragraph [0071], in which a fragrance-stabilizing effect of Citronellol is demonstrated, particularly at a storage temperature of 40°C or under light exposure.

4.1.1 In the contested decision, the opposition division concluded that the patent claims in the amended version were not suggested to the skilled person starting from D5 as the closest prior art (see point 3 of the reasons for the decision). This is not disputed by the appellant and is therefore still valid.

4.1.2 The appellant instead argues that not D5, but D4 constitutes the closest prior art. D4 discloses cosmetic compositions containing 2-(4'-Diethylamino-2'-hydroxybenzoyl)-benzoic acid hexyl ester, the active ingredient (a) defined in claim 1 of the contested patent. Starting from D4, the technical problem to be solved was to stabilize the fragrance of such compositions. This was achieved in an obvious manner by the addition of Citronellol.

4.1.3 Regardless of whether the teaching of D4 is indeed closer to the claimed invention than that of D5, the Board is of the opinion that the claimed compositions also involve an inventive step starting from D4.

4.2 Closest Prior Art

Assuming D4 as the closest prior art, the difference between the claimed compositions and those of D4 is that Citronellol is additionally included. The compositions of D4 contain the substance (a) but no Citronellol. This was undisputed.

4.3 Problem and Solution

4.3.1 Starting from the compositions of D4, the technical problem was to provide cosmetic compositions containing 2-(4'-Diethylamino-2'-hydroxybenzoyl)-benzoic acid ethyl ester (component (a) of claim 1) that are more stable in fragrance during storage.

The claimed solution to this problem is compositions according to claim 1, characterized by the inclusion of Citronellol.

It was disputed whether this problem was actually solved by the claimed compositions.

4.3.2 The respondent relied on the comparative experiment in paragraph [0071] of the patent. In this experiment, a composition containing component (a), additional UV filters (including titanium dioxide and phenylbenzimidazolesulfonic acid), and Citronellol is compared with a composition without Citronellol. It turns out that under various storage conditions, especially at a storage temperature of 40°C and under light exposure, the inventive composition loses less fragrance than the comparative composition. In their view, the problem posed was therefore solved.

4.3.3 In contrast, the appellant argued that the problem posed was not solved, at least not across the entire breadth of the claim.

They stated that it was not shown that a fragrance-stabilizing effect of the tested composition is transferable to other compositions that differ in the choice of UV filters. A variety of structurally different UV filters are listed in claim 1.

4.3.4 The Board does not find this argument of the appellant convincing.

The compositions used in the comparative experiment contain structurally quite different UV filters, such as titanium dioxide, ethylhexyl salicylate, and phenylbenzimidazolesulfonic acid. An influence of the structure of the UV filters is therefore not immediately apparent and has not been convincingly demonstrated without appropriate substantiation with data. The comparative experiment criticized by the appellant was already present in the published patent application and is part of the granted patent. The appellant was free to challenge the validity of this experiment through their own experiments in the context of the opposition proceedings. This did not happen.

4.3.5 Therefore, the Board concludes that the claimed compositions also represent a solution to the technical problem of finding cosmetic compositions with increased fragrance stability starting from D4. The Board does not follow the appellant's view that at most the technical problem of finding alternative cosmetic compositions has been solved.

4.4 Obviousness of the Solution

A fragrance-stabilizing effect of Citronellol on compositions containing component (a) is not described in any of the cited documents.

While Citronellol is known as a component of cosmetic compositions, the prior art, particularly the document D5 cited by the appellant, does not describe that the addition of Citronellol leads to fragrance stabilization of the composition. In D5, this property is attributed, on the contrary, to various UV filters in combination with nitroxylene and hydroxylamines (see, for example, page 1, fourth to sixth paragraph of D5). Citronellol is mentioned on page 41 as a possible ingredient, but not in connection with fragrance-stabilizing properties. Therefore, the skilled person had no incentive to add Citronellol to the compositions described in D4 to solve the posed problem.

The property of this compound to stabilize the fragrance of compositions containing 2-(4'-Diethylamino-2'-hydroxybenzoyl)-benzoic acid hexyl ester was ultimately unknown to them.

4.5 Inventive step is therefore present.

5. In summary, it can be stated that the appellant's submissions in the appeal proceedings cannot undermine the opposition division's decision to maintain the patent in amended form.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,appeal dismissed,Henkel AG & Co.

I. The present decision concerns the appeal of the patent applicant (appellant) against the decision of the examining division (challenged decision) to refuse European patent application No. 14 157 660.3 (application).

The application underlying this appeal procedure is a divisional application of European patent application No. 10 722 598.9 (parent application).

II. With respect to the main request pending before it, the examining division considered the requirements of Articles 76, 123(2), and 54 EPC to be fulfilled. However, it concluded that the subject matter of claim 1 did not involve an inventive step. Furthermore, the examining division decided that the subject matter of claim 1 of the first auxiliary request corresponding to claim 7 of the main request was not sufficiently disclosed.

III. In preparation for the oral proceedings scheduled at the request of the appellant, the board issued a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA 2020.

IV. By letter dated April 28, 2021, the appellant submitted claims of a new main request. The oral proceedings were subsequently canceled.

V. The appellant requested the annulment of the challenged decision and the grant of a patent based on the set of claims of the main request submitted by letter dated April 28, 2021.

VI. The relevant arguments of the appellant for the present decision can be summarized as follows.

The subject matter of claim 1 differs from the closest prior art D1 in that the cosmetic/dermatological formulation contains sorbitan monocaprylate. With respect to this distinguishing feature, the application demonstrates an improved antimicrobial efficacy. This is neither suggested by D1 nor by D2. In the challenged decision, the examining division relied on example 7 disclosed in D2 for the combination of D1 with D2. However, according to D2 itself, this relates to the preparation of a sorbitol ester mixture. No specific reaction conditions are provided for this example. Furthermore, it cannot simply be assumed that the reaction conditions disclosed in examples 1 or 2 of D7 were also chosen for example 7. Thus, D2 cannot teach that sorbitan monocaprylate has an antimicrobial effect. Therefore, the subject matter of the main request involves an inventive step.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The set of claims of the main request consists of the following four claims.

Claim 1

""Cosmetic or dermatological products, preferably cosmetic or dermatological formulations, containing a) sorbitan monocaprylate and b5) piroctone olamine.""

Claim 2

""Products according to claim 1, containing one or more additional antimicrobial active ingredients that are different from the antimicrobial active ingredient of component b5), as component e), wherein the one or more antimicrobial active ingredients of component e) are selected from the group consisting of alcohols, preferably selected from benzyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, propylene phenoxyethanol, phenethyl alcohol, 1,2-pentanediol, 1,2-hexanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,2-octanediol, 1,2-decanediol, methylpropanediol, ethylhexylglycerin, and glycerin, and halogenated preservatives, preferably selected from iodopropynyl butylcarbamate and 2-bromo-2-nitropropan-1,3-diol.""

Claim 3

""Products according to claim 1, wherein the products are aqueous, aqueous-alcoholic, aqueous-surfactant or alcoholic agents or oil-based agents, including oil-based agents in an anhydrous form or emulsions, suspensions or dispersions, in the form of fluids, foams, sprays, gels, mousses, lotions, creams, powders or wet wipes.""

Claim 4

""Products according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, wherein the substances of components a) and b5), based on the finished products, i.e., the cosmetic or dermatological formulations, are contained together in an amount of 0.1 to 4.0 wt.%, preferably together in an amount of 0.2 to 3.0 wt.%, particularly preferably together in an amount of 0.3 to 2.5 wt.%, and especially preferably together in an amount of 0.5 to 2.0 wt.% in the products or formulations.""

2. Amendments and Clarity (Article 123(2) and 84 EPC)

As a basis for the claims of the main request, the following passages in the application as originally filed can be cited as examples:

- Claim 1: Page 17, lines 26 to 31

- Claim 2: Page 18, line 1 to page 19, line 9

- Claim 3: Page 14, lines 14 to 19

- Claim 4: Page 22, lines 22 to 30.

Thus, the claims of the main request meet the requirement of Article 123(2) EPC.

The Board has also convinced itself that the claims of the main request are clear.

3. Sufficient Disclosure (Article 83 EPC)

As stated above, the examining division considered the subject matter of claim 1 of the first auxiliary request corresponding to claim 7 of the main request to be insufficiently disclosed. By the deletion of claim 7 in the currently pending main request, this objection of the examining division has become moot. The examining division did not raise any objection of insufficient disclosure against the subject matter of the claims remaining in the current main request. The Board is also convinced that the subject matter of these claims is sufficiently disclosed.

4. Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

No novelty objections were raised by the examining division, and the Board is convinced that the subject matter of the main request is novel.

5. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

5.1 Claim 1 of the main request is identical to claim 1 of the main request dealt with in the contested decision. In this regard, the examining division was of the opinion that an inventive step could not be recognized (Point II above).

5.2 The objective of the application was to find a dermatologically and toxicologically safe substance that supports the antimicrobial effect of antimicrobial active ingredients. Sorbitan monocaprylate was identified as a substance that solves this task (Page 2, lines 21 to 28 of the application as originally filed).

D1 deals with ""preservatives and their practical application in cosmetic products"" (see title). In accordance with the contested decision, the Board also considers D1 to be the closest prior art.

5.3 D1 (Page 353, the paragraph spanning both columns, No. 2, as well as Page 346, Point 2.1.2 b)) discloses, for example, an O/W emulsion containing 0.5 wt.% of the preservative piroctone olamine. Furthermore, this emulsion contains sorbitan fatty acid esters (see Page 346, right column, lines 1 to 4). D1 further discloses that the chosen amount of the preservative does not lead to sufficient preservation.

5.4 The above-mentioned O/W emulsion is, as required by claim 1, a cosmetic/dermatological formulation. The piroctone olamine contained therein is the claimed component b5). D1 does not provide any information on which compounds were specifically used as sorbitan fatty acid esters.

As already noted by the examining division, the subject matter of claim 1 thus differs from D1 in that the cosmetic/dermatological formulation contains sorbitan monocaprylate.

5.5 As shown in Example 16b) and Table B of the originally filed application, the addition of sorbitan monocaprylate (""SC"" in Table B) to a cream formulation containing 0.05 wt.% piroctone olamine (""Octopirox"" in Table B) results in a significant increase in antimicrobial efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (and this at a concentration of piroctone olamine that is ten times lower compared to D1). A similar observation is made with the shampoo formulation (Example 17, Table C, see in particular Page 31, lines 13 to 17). These data demonstrate, contrary to the view expressed in the contested decision, a technical effect associated with the distinguishing feature.

5.6 The objective technical problem can therefore be seen as improving the microbiological stability of the formulation disclosed in D1 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

5.7 D1 does not provide any teaching that sorbitan fatty acid esters in general or sorbitan monocaprylate in particular have antimicrobial activity, let alone antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

5.8 The examining division referred in this context to D2. This document relates to the production of ester compositions with antimicrobial activity. Example 7 discloses the production of mono- and di-C4-10 fatty acid sorbitol esters. The reaction conditions for the preparation of this ester mixture were chosen from the conditions of Examples 1 or 2. It is common general knowledge that under the reaction conditions of Examples 1 or 2, sorbitol cyclizes to sorbitan with the elimination of water. Thus, the reaction mixture obtained from Example 7 must also necessarily contain mono-C8 fatty acid esters of sorbitan, i.e., sorbitan monocaprylate. In light of the overall disclosure of D2, the skilled person would derive from this the antimicrobial activity of sorbitan monocaprylate as well. Adding this to the composition of D1 would not have required any inventive step.

The Board cannot agree with this. Example 7 of D2 itself refers to the production of sorbitol esters and not to the production of sorbitan esters. Since the reaction conditions chosen for the implementation are not discussed in detail, it cannot be concluded from Example 7 that the obtained ester mixture necessarily contains sorbitan esters (let alone sorbitan monocaprylate). Insofar as the examining division refers to the reaction conditions of Examples 1 and 2, its argumentation is self-contradictory, because if it is common knowledge that under the reaction conditions chosen in these examples sorbitan esters are inevitably formed, the question arises as to why the skilled person would have chosen these conditions in Example 7, which explicitly focuses on the formation of sorbitol esters.

Thus, D2 also does not provide any teaching that sorbitan fatty acid esters in general or sorbitan monocaprylate in particular have antimicrobial activity.

5.9 Consequently, the subject matter of claim 1 and that of dependent claims 2 to 4 is based on an inventive step.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2.

I. The appeal of the appellant (opponent) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to reject the opposition against patent EP 2 150 515 under Article 101(2) EPC.

II. The opposition was based on Article 100(a), (b), and (c) EPC due to lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC), lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC), lack of sufficiency of disclosure (Article 83 EPC), and impermissible amendments (Article 123(2) EPC).

III. The following document is relevant to the present decision:

D1: WO2005/015998

IV. In the contested decision, the opposition division concluded that the grounds for opposition raised did not preclude the maintenance of the patent. In particular, the patent claims were not the result of an impermissible selection from the original application documents (Article 123(2) EPC), but constituted a new selection from D1 (Article 54 EPC), which was not suggested to the skilled person even in combination with D2 (Article 56 EPC). Furthermore, the claimed invention was sufficiently disclosed. The opposition was therefore rejected.

V. In her statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant argued, among other things, that the claims of the granted patent were not novel with respect to document D1.

She requested that the contested decision be overturned and the patent be revoked. Alternatively, she requested oral proceedings.

VI. In her response to the appeal, the respondent argued on this matter that the compositions defined in the claims of the granted patent constituted a new selection from D1, which was not described there in that manner. This was rightly established by the opposition division.

She requested that the appeal be dismissed. Alternatively, she requested that the patent be maintained in amended form based on one of auxiliary requests 1-13 submitted with the response to the appeal. Auxiliary request 1 had already been part of the opposition proceedings.

VII. The board issued a communication on December 15, 2020, under Article 100(2) EPC, informing the parties of the board's preliminary assessment of the factual and legal situation.

The board was particularly of the preliminary opinion that novelty over D1 was not given. Therefore, a revocation of the patent and an overturning of the contested decision were to be expected.

VIII. By summons dated June 17, 2021, the parties were summoned to oral proceedings on June 2, 2022, as requested.

IX. By letter dated June 30, 2021, the respondent withdrew her request for oral proceedings.

X. By letter dated July 7, 2021, the board therefore cancelled the hearing date. The parties were informed that the proceedings would continue in writing.

XI. No further submissions were made by the respondent; the appellant reaffirmed her auxiliary request for oral proceedings by letter dated July 14, 2021, should the patent not be revoked as requested.

XII. Independent claim 1 of the granted patent has the following wording:

""Means comprising

a) at least one active ingredient for plant treatment; and

b) at least one alkoxylated alcohol of the formula (IIa)

R-O-(CmH2mO)q-(CnH2nO)x-(C2H4O)y-Z (IIa),

wherein

R is C1-C7 alkyl;

m is 2 or 3;

q is 0, 1, 2, or 3;

n is an integer from 3 to 16;

x is a value from 1 to 100;

y is greater than 0 and is a value up to 100;

x+y corresponds to a value from 10 to 30; and

Z is hydrogen or C1-C3 alkyl,

wherein the weight ratio of component b) to component a) is greater than 1.""

Independent claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 has the following wording:

""Means comprising

a) at least one active ingredient for plant treatment; and

b) at least one alkoxylated alcohol of the formula (III)

R-O-(CmH2mO)q-(C3H6O)x-(C2H4O)y-Z (IIa),

wherein

R is C1-C7 alkyl;

m is 2 or 3;

q is 0, 1, 2, or 3;

x is a value greater than 5 to 100;

y is a value from 1 to 100;

x+y corresponds to a value from 10 to 30; and

Z is hydrogen or C1-C3 alkyl,

wherein the weight ratio of component b) to component a) is greater than 1.""

Independent claim 1 of auxiliary requests 2-7 is based on claim 1 of the granted patent, wherein the active ingredient a) is defined successively more specifically, as follows:

""wherein the active ingredient is a pesticide"" (auxiliary request 2)

""wherein the active ingredient is selected from fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides"" (auxiliary request 3)

""wherein the active ingredient is a fungicide"" (auxiliary request 4)

""wherein the active ingredient is a fungicide selected from anilines, triazolopyrimidines, strobilurins, and triazoles"" (auxiliary request 5)

""wherein the active ingredient is a fungicide selected from boscalid, carboxin, metalaxyl, oxadixyl, 5-chloro-7-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)-6-(2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)[1,2,4]triazol[1,5-a]-pyrimidin, azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, dimoxystrobin, trifloxystrobin, fluoxystrobin, picoxystrobin, orysastrobin, epoxiconazole, metconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, fluquinconazole, triticonazole, propiconazole, penconazole, cyproconazole, and prothioconazole"" (auxiliary request 6)

""wherein the active ingredient is epiconazole"" (auxiliary request 7)

Independent claim 1 of auxiliary requests 8-13 is based in an analogous manner on independent claim 1 of auxiliary request 1.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. The decision in the written procedure is permissible. The respondent did not request an oral hearing, as this was withdrawn after receipt of the summons. The auxiliary request for an oral hearing by the appellant is irrelevant in light of the decision corresponding to their main request for revocation of the patent. The Board has informed the parties of the reasons for the decision in its communication issued in accordance with Rule 100(2) EPC and provided an opportunity for comments, thus ensuring that the right to be heard under Article 113(1) EPC is respected.

3. The patent relates to plant protection agents. The claimed agents contain, in addition to an active ingredient, in particular an alkoxylated alcohol that serves as an adjuvant to accelerate the uptake of the active ingredient, see [0026].

Patent as Granted

4. Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

4.1 D1 also discloses plant protection agents that contain alkoxylated alcohols as adjuvants to accelerate the uptake of the active ingredient, see for example page 2, lines 4 to 43. Fungicides are used as active ingredients.

4.2 The question of novelty with respect to D1 essentially focuses on whether the alcohol alkoxylates disclosed on page 7, line 38 to page 8, line 9 of D1 fall under formula (II) in the definition of component b) of claim 1 of the patent, or whether the undoubtedly existing overlap can be seen as a new selection from D1. The claimed feature of the ratios of the alcohol alkoxylates (b) to the active ingredients (a) being greater than 1 is, however, clearly disclosed in a general manner in D1 (see page 32, lines 8/9 or claim 2).

The opposition division concluded in its decision that a new selection had been made in the overlapping area from D1.

4.3 The Board would like to first establish that the compounds in the relevant passage of D1 (page 7, lines 38ff) are disclosed as embodiments. If these compounds fall under claim 1 of the patent, then the claim is not novel, regardless of whether D1 also discloses other embodiments that do not fall under the claim. In this respect, a ""selection"" put forward by the respondent would merely select embodiments already described in D1 and would not be novel.

4.4 The PO-EO block alkoxylates described on page 7, line 44 correspond to the following formula (nomenclature of D1):

R**(6)O-(C3H6O)x-(C2H4O)y-H

Here, the sum of x and y is typically 1.5 to 30, preferably 2.5 to 21, and particularly 5 to 14.

R**(6) is, according to the general formula (II) on page 6, a C5-C30 alkyl or C5-C30 alkenyl.

This residue is further specified on page 8, lines 28ff as a branched alkyl residue. From the preferred definitions for R**(7) and R**(8) there, alkyl residues of C6-C16, particularly C8-C12, are calculated; a C10 residue is indicated as particularly preferred.

4.5 This embodiment of D1 corresponds in the present claim 1 to compounds for (nomenclature of the patent) q=0, n=3, and Z=H, thus compounds of the formula:

R-O-(C3H6O)x-(C2H4O)y-H

Here, R is provided as C1-C7 alkyl. The sum of x and y is 10-30.

This range of the claim therefore overlaps with the disclosure of D1.

4.6 A group of chemical compounds is considered novel if it is distinguished from the compounds in the prior art by a new feature that is not previously described there (see for example T 12/90, points 2.6 and 2.7 of the reasons). Otherwise, existing prior art would simply be patented without adding new information to it. This is incompatible with the purpose and intent of Article 54 EPC.

4.7 In the present case of compounds defined in the form of a Markush formula, such a new feature can only be a structural element. However, a new structural element is not defined in the overlapping area with D1 in the present main claim.

The claimed sum of x and y is 10-30, which is in the same range as in D1 with 1-30; the preferred ranges of D1 (2.5-21, 5-14) also fall at least with individual endpoints into the claimed range. This feature cannot establish novelty.

The alkyl group R of the claimed alcohol residue has a length of 1-7, while in D1 it is disclosed as 5-30, 6-16, 8-12, or 10 in ascending preference. In these definitions, the lower limits of the first two fall into the claimed range. From this, one can at most conclude that the claimed compounds are less preferred in D1 but are still disclosed. Novelty is not created by this feature either.

Thus, compounds already described in the prior art are claimed here, without distinguishing the claimed group of compounds by a differentiable structural element.

4.8 The respondent argued that the choice of R as C1-C7 alkyl contradicts the preferred definitions of D1; therefore, a new selection from the compounds disclosed in D1 must be recognized. This is only partially correct; it should be noted that C6-C16 alkyl is also preferred in D1. Furthermore, the disclosure of D1 cannot be reduced only to its preferred ranges. Less preferred ranges are also disclosed as such.

Moreover, the respondent argued that for the choice of the sum x+y as 10-30, the skilled person must act contrary to the teaching of D1. This argument cannot convince either, as the preferred ranges of the disclosure of D1 also fall with one endpoint into the claimed range.

Both the claimed value for R and that for x+y are already described in D1 in a preferred manner.

4.9 The Board is therefore convinced that the claims of the patent are rendered unnovel by D1 in the overlapping area. In this overlapping area, a selection was indeed made from the alkoxylated alcohols described in D1 in the form of a Markush formula in the sense that a smaller range is claimed. However, the selected alkoxylated alcohols are already described in D1. Such a selection of known items cannot confer novelty to a claim.

Auxiliary Request 1

5. Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

The compounds relevant for the novelty discussion with respect to D1 in claim 1 of the auxiliary request are compounds (III) for q=0 and Z=H, i.e., compounds of the formula

R-O-(C3H6O)x-(C2H4O)y-H

The only additional condition compared to the compounds discussed above in the main request is that now x>5 is required.

D1 describes in the relevant passage (page 7, line 38 to page 8, line 10) values for x from 0.5 to 10, preferably 0.5 to 6, and particularly 1-4. Both the generally disclosed value and the preferred value fall into the claimed range. Therefore, novelty is likewise not present as for the compounds of the main request.

Auxiliary Requests 2-7 and 8-13

6. Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

6.1 The independent claims of auxiliary requests 2-7 and 8-13 are based on the independent claims of the granted patent or auxiliary request 1, in which the significance of the active ingredient a) is specified in a converging manner, namely from ""pesticides"" in general in auxiliary requests 2 or 8 to ""epiconazole"" in auxiliary requests 7 or 13.

The alkoxylated alcohols b), which, as stated above, are already known from D1, remain unchanged compared to the main claims of the granted patent or auxiliary request 1.

6.2 In D1, epiconazole is generally mentioned as a possible active ingredient, see claim 27, and is also used in the examples. This feature therefore does not contribute to novelty over D1.

The respondent has not presented any arguments in the proceedings as to why the limitations in auxiliary requests 2-13 should be relevant for the novelty assessment against D1.

6.3 The subject matter of auxiliary requests 2-13 is therefore also already disclosed in D1.

7. In summary, it should be noted that the patent cannot be maintained on the basis of the present claims due to lack of novelty. Therefore, there is no need to address the other raised grounds for opposition.

The patent is therefore to be revoked in accordance with Article 101(2) or 101(3)(b) EPC.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2.

I. Both the patent holder and the opponent filed timely and properly formatted appeals against the decision of the opposition division to maintain the contested patent EP 1 717 223 in amended form under Article 101(3)(a) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged under Articles 100(a), 100(b), and 100(c) EPC for lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC), lack of sufficiency of disclosure (Article 83 EPC), and impermissible amendments concerning the parent application or the originally filed divisional application (Articles 76(1) and 123(2) EPC).

In the contested decision, the opposition division concluded that the claims of the main request before it had been impermissibly amended. However, the first auxiliary request met the requirements of the EPC. On this basis, the patent could be maintained.

IV. The independent claim 1 of the main request underlying the contested decision of the patent holder reads as follows:

""Method for purifying a product stream from isocyanate synthesis, comprising

- distillative purification of a crude isocyanate stream (1) in vacuum at 1 to 120 mbar and at temperatures of 90 to 170 °C into a gaseous distillate (3) and a liquid partial stream (2),

- keeping the non-evaporatable residue in partial stream (2) separate from the distillate stream (3) and/or from material streams that at least partially contain the distillate stream (3),

- separating isocyanate contained in the liquid partial stream (2) from the non-evaporatable residue contained therein as isocyanate-containing vaporous residual stream (4),

characterized in that the separation is carried out in a paddle dryer without a cooling zone and with a discharge screw for the non-evaporatable residue (8).""

V. The independent claim 1 of the first auxiliary request underlying the contested decision of the patent holder reads as follows:

""Method for purifying a product stream from isocyanate synthesis, comprising

- distillative purification of a crude isocyanate stream (1) in vacuum at 1 to 120 mbar and at temperatures of 90 to 170 °C into a gaseous distillate (3) and a liquid partial stream (2),

- keeping the non-evaporatable residue in partial stream (2) separate from the distillate stream (3) and/or from material streams that at least partially contain the distillate stream (3),

- separating isocyanate contained in the liquid partial stream (2) from the non-evaporatable residue contained therein as isocyanate-containing vaporous residual stream (4),

- distillative separation of the isocyanate-containing vaporous residual stream (4) and the distillate stream (3) into three individual streams (5,6,7) with different boiling ranges, wherein the lightest boiling stream (5) contains a substantial part of the light boiling fraction of the crude isocyanate stream (1), the heaviest boiling stream (7) contains a substantial part of the heavy boiling fraction of the crude isocyanate stream (1), and the medium boiling stream (6) essentially contains valuable product,

characterized in that the separation is carried out in a paddle dryer without a cooling zone and with a discharge screw for the non-evaporatable residue (8).""

The underlined section has been added compared to the main request.

The four steps defined in this procedure will be referred to as steps (a), (b), (c), and (d).

The further auxiliary requests are irrelevant for the present decision.

VI. The appellant-opponent has essentially argued the following regarding the relevant issues in the proceedings:

The decision of the opposition division not to grant the main request due to impermissible amendments was correct. The original disclosure is limited to a four-step method. A three-step method as claimed was not disclosed as such.

The auxiliary request was wrongly granted by the opposition division. Although the missing fourth step (d) from the main request was reinserted into the claim, various other features of the independent and several dependent claims have been impermissibly amended, Articles 76(1) and 123(2) EPC. The claimed method is only described in an executable manner for aromatic isocyanates, but not for aliphatic isocyanates, Article 83 EPC. Based on D5 as the closest prior art, the claimed method is obvious to the skilled person, Article 56 EPC. Only generally known distillation conditions are defined in step (a), and a trivial distillation for separating impurities has been added with step (d).

VII. The appellant-patent holder has essentially argued the following regarding the relevant issues in the proceedings:

A three-step method according to claim 1 of the main request was originally disclosed as such. The decision of the opposition division should therefore be corrected.

The auxiliary request was rightly considered allowable by the opposition division. No impermissible amendments have been made. The opponent has not provided evidence that the claimed method does not work with aliphatic isocyanates. The claimed method is not suggested to the skilled person based on D10, as confirmed in the contested decision. D5 is less suitable as the closest prior art. Even based on D5, the claimed method is not suggested to the skilled person, as various process steps would have to be isolated from other processes and incorporated into the process of D5. There is no incentive to do so.

VIII. On January 18, 2021, the board issued a communication under Rule 100(2) EPC, providing a preliminary assessment of the disputed factual and legal issues.

IX. By summons dated July 7, 2021, the parties were summoned to an oral hearing on June 2, 2022. The hearing took place on the scheduled date by mutual agreement in the form of a video conference. At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.

X. The requests of the parties were as follows:

The appellant-patent holder requested that the contested decision be overturned and that the patent be maintained on the basis of the main request underlying the decision. Alternatively, it requested maintenance based on the first auxiliary request underlying the decision, i.e., the dismissal of the opponent's appeal. Furthermore, it requested alternatively maintenance based on various other auxiliary requests, which are irrelevant for the present decision.

Additionally, the patent holder requested that the documents D11-D14 submitted by the opponent in the appeal proceedings not be admitted into the proceedings.

The appellant-opponent requested that the contested decision be overturned and the patent be revoked.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeals are admissible.

2. Admission of documents into the proceedings

The patent holder has requested the non-admission of documents D11-D14.

The opponent stated during the oral proceedings that they do not need D13 and D14 for their arguments and did not refer to these documents.

Regarding D11 and D12, the chamber concludes that their admission or non-admission is not decisive for the outcome of the proceedings, see below. Therefore, a corresponding decision is unnecessary.

Main request of the patent holder

3. Amendments (Article 76(1) and 123(2) EPC)

The chamber agrees with the assessment of the opposition division on this point, also considering the submissions of the patent holder in the appeal proceedings. The reasons for this are explained below. For the original disclosure, reference is made to the published parent application WO2004/056759; the description of the originally filed divisional application is identical.

3.1 Claim 1 of the main request defines a method for purifying a product stream from isocyanate synthesis, which comprises at least three steps:

a) Distillative separation of the crude stream (1) into a liquid (2) and a gaseous (3) stream

b) Keeping the streams (2) and (3) separate

c) Separating isocyanate contained in the liquid partial stream (2) from non-evaporable residue as vaporous residual stream (4); this separation is carried out in a paddle dryer without a cooling zone and with a discharge screw for the non-evaporable residue.

3.2 This claim differs from claim 1 of the original disclosure or the description of the method there on page 3, line 28 to page 4, line 10, among other things, in that the last step (d) is missing. In this last step, the streams (3) and (4) obtained in steps (a) and (c) are distillatively separated into three streams (5), (6), and (7), of which the middle stream (6) essentially contains the valuable product (see page 4, lines 5-10).

3.3 The question thus arises whether a purification method for a product stream from isocyanate synthesis, consisting only of steps (a), (b), and (c), was originally disclosed.

3.3.1 The opposition division used the so-called essentiality test to assess this question, which is described in the examination guidelines H-V, 3.1. This test is referred to in the currently valid edition of the guidelines only as a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for a claim to meet the requirements of Article 123(2) or 76(1) EPC.

In the chamber's view, the crucial question is whether the so-called gold standard was adhered to in the amendment made, i.e., whether a person skilled in the art can directly and unambiguously derive the content of the claim using their general technical knowledge from the originally disclosed documents. This follows from G 2/10 with reference to G 3/89 and G 11/91, see point 4.3 of the reasons for the decision, and is also seen in recent case law (see, for example, T 838/16, point 2 of the reasons for the decision).

3.3.2 The method described in the original application includes the four steps (a) to (d), as set out in the general disclosure on page 3, line 28 to page 4, line 10.

Step (d) of this method is explained in more detail on pages line 31 to page 9, line 30, where various alternative embodiments are described. All these alternatives have in common that the initially obtained streams (3) and (4) are distillatively separated into three streams (5), (6), and (7). Nowhere is it described that this step would only be a preferred embodiment or could be omitted, as claimed by the patent holder. On the contrary, the middle stream (6) obtained in this process step is consistently referred to as the ""re-isocyanate stream,"" while streams (5) and (7) are referred to as light and heavy boiling streams and are discarded at the end (see page 9, lines 1/2). Both embodiments in Figures 1 and 2 include step (d). Although, of course, steps (a) to (c) already achieve some purification of the crude isocyanate stream, there is nowhere in the original documents a description of a purification method for a crude isocyanate stream, where the separately obtained streams (3) and (4) are taken as product streams, as claimed by the patent holder.

3.3.3 A three-step purification method, as defined in claim 1 of the main request, was therefore not originally described.

3.4 This was already established in the decision issued by the chamber under Rule 100(2) EPC; during the oral proceedings, the patent holder did not make any further statements on this.

3.5 The appeal of the patent holder is therefore unfounded.

First auxiliary request of the patent holder

4. Based on this request, the patent was maintained by the opposition division in amended form according to Article 101(3)(a) EPC.

As a result, this decision also stands after the submissions of the parties in the appeal proceedings, as will be justified below.

5. Amendments (Article 76(1) and 123(2) EPC)

5.1 Claim 1 of the first auxiliary request differs from claim 1 of the main request in that the missing step (d) from the main request has been reintroduced from page 4, lines 5-10 of the description. The objection against the main request in this regard has therefore been resolved.

5.2 The opponent raised a number of objections during their submissions regarding the main request that also apply to the first auxiliary request. However, these objections are not convincing for the following reasons:

5.2.1 The opponent argued that the output stream defined in claim 1 is defined more broadly than originally disclosed, as the higher and lower boiling components mentioned in the original disclosure of step (a), as well as the non-evaporable residue, are not explicitly required as components thereof.

However, claim 1 requires a ""crude isocyanate stream"" as the starting product, which, according to the preamble, originates from an isocyanate synthesis. Such streams always contain both higher and lower boiling components as well as non-evaporable residues. These are, moreover, removed from the stream according to the wording of the subsequent steps (b) and (d), so they must have been present beforehand. No unlawful extension has been made here.

The opponent specifically argued that in claim 1 of the original application, step (a) stipulated that the gaseous distillate (3) contains isocyanates and light boilers, whereas the present claim no longer requires isocyanates. Therefore, a method is also covered by the claim in which stream (3) contains only light boilers.

The chamber also sees no unlawful extension here. While it is true that according to the wording of the claim, no isocyanates are required in stream (3), step (a) describes a distillation of the crude isocyanate stream into a liquid and a gaseous partial stream. It is inevitable that at least to some extent, isocyanates will also be present in the gaseous distillate; a complete separation is impossible. The original claim does not require a specific proportion of isocyanates either. The presence of isocyanates in the gaseous distillate is therefore an implicit feature of the amended claim.

5.2.2 The opponent also criticized that the streams (2) and (3) in step (a) are only characterized as liquid and gaseous, while in the original disclosure, stream (2) additionally requires a non-evaporable residue and stream (3) the light boilers.

The same applies as above. The non-evaporable residue is removed from stream (2) in step (c), so it was present in it beforehand. The light boilers are removed from streams (3) and (4) in step (d); since stream (4) comes from stream (2), which is drawn off from the sump in the first distillation, the light boilers come from stream (3) and therefore do not need to be defined separately in step (a).

5.2.3 The opponent also criticized the formulation of the separation of the isocyanate as a gaseous stream (4) from the non-evaporable residue in step (c). In the original disclosure, the latter is additionally referred to as stream (8).

However, the omission of this designation does not go beyond the original disclosure. The wording of step (c) according to claim 1 can be found on page 7, lines 12/13 of the original documents.

5.2.4 Regarding dependent claims 3-6, it was argued that these are each a selection from the original disclosure.

However, it is not a selection that would be associated with a new, originally undisclosed teaching. Only alternatives from lists have been removed.

5.2.5 Regarding dependent claims 7 and 8, it was argued that the disclosure of the temperatures and pressures on page 7, lines 24/25 is limited to the corresponding combinations. Pressures and temperatures are not disclosed independently of each other.

However, this is not clearly evident from the paragraph. It does not describe a temperature in combination with a pressure, but rather lists two temperature and two pressure ranges sequentially. Therefore, there is no disclosure of these ranges only in combination.

5.2.6 The features of the dependent claims are disclosed in a general manner in the description. A combination of the dependent claims with independent claim 1 therefore does not introduce any originally undisclosed features into the claims, contrary to the opponent's submissions.

5.3 The requirements of Articles 123(2) and 76(1) EPC are therefore fulfilled.

6. Clarity (Article 84 EPC)

According to G 03/14, the clarity examination in opposition proceedings is limited to features that were not already present in the granted claims. In the present case, this concerns the step (d) added to the first auxiliary request, as this was not part of the claim in the granted patent. The opponent raised two objections.

6.1 One objection concerns the designation of streams (5), (6), and (7) as light, medium, and heavy boiling. The opponent argued that these are relative designations, which, according to the examination guidelines, F-IV, 4.6.1, are not permissible as long as there is no generally accepted definition of these designations in the relevant technical field.

However, the chamber is convinced that this is unproblematic. These designations define the boiling ranges of the streams relative to each other. A person skilled in the art can distinguish the streams based on these designations. Whether these terms have a clear definition in the field of isocyanate synthesis is therefore irrelevant.

6.2 The second objection concerns the condition that the lightest boiling stream contains a substantial part of the light boiler content of the crude isocyanate stream (1), the heaviest boiling stream contains a substantial part of the heavy boiler content of the crude isocyanate stream (1), and the medium stream essentially contains the valuable product.

6.2.1 The opponent argued that it is unclear which proportions are defined by this. In particular, they referred to the example of the patent. There, for the crude isocyanate stream (1), 170 ppm of light boilers are indicated, which corresponds to a flow of 1.7 g/h at 1 kg/h. For stream (5), this would result in 0.15 g/h. This means that stream 5 contains only about 10% of the light boiler content from the crude isocyanate stream (1); this cannot be considered a substantial part.

6.2.2 The patent holder argued that a person skilled in the art knows what is meant by a substantial part. They referred to paragraph [0048] of the description, which defines a proportion of re-isocyanate in the medium stream (6) of over 99%. Regarding the proportions of light and heavy boiling impurities from stream (1) that must be contained in streams (5) and (7), they argued that the opponent's calculations are not comprehensible. Moreover, these streams are unimportant, as they are discarded anyway, as described in paragraph [0044].

6.2.3 The chamber is convinced that the introduced features do not create any ambiguity.

The calculation presented by the opponent in their appeal brief is based on a calculation error, as 170 ppm of the crude isocyanate stream (1) at 1 kg/h corresponds to 0.17 g/h, not 1.7 g/h. Therefore, stream (5) contains about 88% of the light boiling impurities introduced in stream (1), which a skilled person would consider a substantial part. The example illustrates the claimed method and does not contradict the claims, as asserted by the opponent.

The claim requires that substantial parts of light and heavy boiling impurities from stream (1) are found in streams (5) and (7). Even though the claim does not specify numerical proportions, it is clear to a skilled person what is meant. Similarly, it is clear to a skilled person what is meant by the condition that stream (6) essentially contains the valuable product. As pointed out by the patent holder, they would also have a reference from paragraph [48] of the description.

6.3 The clarity requirement of Article 84 is therefore fulfilled.

7. Sufficiency of disclosure (Article 83 EPC)

The opponent also raised two objections regarding the lack of sufficiency of disclosure.

7.1 The first objection of the opponent concerns the nature of the paddle dryer used in step (c), namely a paddle dryer without a cooling zone and with a discharge screw for the non-evaporable residue. According to the opponent, a skilled person does not know what this entails.

The patent indeed does not provide any information on this. The question is whether a skilled person at the priority date would have known which devices to use for this purpose.

The patent holder argued that paddle dryers without a cooling zone and with a discharge screw are disclosed in D6, particularly in Figure 4.

The chamber finds this sufficient. Such dryers were available to the skilled person at the priority date. Thus, a skilled person can carry out the claimed method. Further considerations by the opponent regarding whether other apparatuses might also be meant by the definition used in the claim do not change this.

7.2 The second objection of the opponent concerns the nature of the isocyanate used.

7.2.1 The opponent argued that the claimed method cannot work when using aliphatic isocyanates, particularly the removal of the non-evaporable residue in step (c). They refer to the method in D5, which describes such a separation step in a paddle dryer without a cooling zone for TDI, an aromatic isocyanate. According to D3 (column 2, lines 42-64), this drying does not work with aliphatic isocyanates because a sticky mass forms that clogs the apparatus used. As a solution to this problem, D3 describes the introduction of a cooling zone into the dryer.

From D3 in combination with D5, it is therefore clear that at least parts of the claimed method are not described as executable. The patent itself does not contain any examples with aliphatic isocyanates. It is therefore the patent holder's responsibility to prove that such a method is executable.

7.2.2 The opposition division was not convinced by these arguments, as the method of D5 is not equivalent to the method in the present claims. In particular, step (a) is not described there, nor is step (b), at least not explicitly.

The patent holder additionally pointed out that D3 does not state whether the apparatus from D5 was used. Furthermore, D3 does not describe any concrete experiments.

7.2.3 In opposition proceedings, the opponent bears the burden of proof that the patent does not meet the relevant provisions of the EPC, see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 9th edition, III G 5.2.1. The chamber concludes in the present case that the information in D3 and D5 is not sufficient to substantiate doubts about the sufficiency of disclosure, which are supported by verifiable facts. A reversal of the burden of proof in the sense that the patent holder would have to refute the results from D3/D5 is therefore not justified.

D5 takes a mixture referred to as ""distillation residues"" as the starting material. In Example 1 of D5, the sump of a concentration column is used, which consists of TDI and polymerization residues. This may correspond to stream (2) of the present claim. However, details are lacking.

According to D3, the drying process of D5 cannot be adapted to aliphatic isocyanates without the introduction of a cooling zone. However, D3 does not contain any concrete experiments but only generally describes that the inventors of D3 were unable to transfer the process of D5 to aliphatic isocyanates. As pointed out by the patent holder, it is unclear what type of apparatus was used or what starting materials were precisely employed. There are no verifiable statements in D3 regarding the conducted process that would allow conclusions about the reasons for the failure. The mere assertion in D3 that the process of D5 does not work cannot lead to a reversal of the burden of proof.

7.3 The requirements of Article 83 EPC are therefore fulfilled.

8. Inventive step (Article 56 EPC)

8.1 In the contested decision, the opposition division concluded that the claimed method is neither suggested starting from D5 nor starting from D10 (point 10 of the reasons for the decision).

Both in the appeal brief and in the response to the patent holder's appeal brief, the opponent has taken D5 as the closest prior art. The fact that the claimed method is not suggested starting from D10 has not been disputed and is therefore still valid.

After weighing the arguments presented by the parties, the chamber concludes that inventive step is also present starting from D5. The reasoning is set out below.

8.2 Differences of the claimed method compared to D5

8.2.1 D5 deals with the problem of isolating TDI from a liquid, viscous residue that occurs in an amount of 10-15% during TDI synthesis. The goal of D5 is to obtain TDI on the one hand and a dry residue that can then be subjected to combustion (see column 1, lines 12-24). For this purpose, it is proposed to carry out the separation of TDI from the solid residues in a paddle dryer (see the paragraph spanning columns 1 and 2 or Example 1). This paddle dryer has a discharge screw (""continuously extruded under vacuum with a hot screw,"" column 2, lines 37/38), and a cooling zone is not described.

8.2.2 The claims relate to a method for purifying a product stream from isocyanate synthesis, comprising steps (a) to (d).

The method of D5 corresponds to step (c) of the claimed method. The stream used in D5 corresponds to the process stream (2), and the obtained TDI corresponds to the process stream (4). Furthermore, D5 discloses that the input stream comes from the sump of a concentration column (Example 1), from which it can be inferred that another part of the TDI was distilled off (corresponding to stream 3). However, the distillation conditions used in step (a) of the present claim are not mentioned.

The opponent believes that the claim feature (b) is also disclosed, as the streams are not re-combined. Feature (b) requires that the gaseous distillate (3) distilled off in the first distillation step is kept separate from the non-evaporable residue contained in the liquid stream (2). In D5, the distillate (3) is not explicitly mentioned, nor is feature (b). Whether the feature is implicitly disclosed is disputed but not decisive, as will be explained below.

The claimed method therefore differs from that of D5 at least in the following points:

i) the distillation conditions in step (a)

ii) the downstream step (d), in which streams (3) and (4) are separated into three fractions (5), (6), and (7), of which stream (6) contains the pure isocyanate.

8.3 Technical problem and its solution

8.3.1 The opponent argued regarding the problem to be solved that for steps (a) and (d), partial tasks would have to be defined that should be considered separately, as there is no synergy between steps (a) and (d). For step (a), the technical problem is to find suitable distillation conditions. For step (d), the technical problem is to separate a stream containing isocyanates and light and heavy boilers as impurities accordingly.

The chamber cannot agree with this. Such an approach overlooks that the present patent aims to provide a complete method for producing pure isocyanate from a crude isocyanate stream. This task is not described in D5. D5 has a different goal, as it is only concerned with recovering residual isocyanate from the solid residues of the distillation sump of a partial step of such a method. Breaking down the technical problem into partial tasks based on individual steps of D5, as done by the opponent, disregards that the claimed overall method pursues a different goal than D5.

8.3.2 The problem to be solved is described in paragraph [0015] of the patent and consists of finding a method for producing pure isocyanate by purifying a crude isocyanate stream that makes a product as pure as possible available with as little effort as possible. Since, as explained above, this problem has not been solved in D5, there is no reason to reformulate it in light of this document.

The problem is solved by the claimed four-step method, which is characterized in particular by establishing suitable distillation conditions in the first step and allowing for a separation into light boilers, valuable product, and heavy boilers in the last step. That the method solves the stated problem has not been disputed; the opponent argues on the contrary that the solution to the problem would have been obvious to the skilled person.

8.4 Obviousness of the solution

8.4.1 The claimed solution to the problem is not suggested by the prior art.

8.4.2 A skilled person would have had to take a step back from D5 to take the crude isocyanate stream (1) as the starting stream. They would then have had to consider the claimed pressure and temperature conditions for the first distillation (a), separate the obtained gaseous stream (3) into three fractions (5), (6), and (7), process the liquid stream obtained in (a) according to the method of D5, and also separate the gaseous stream obtained there into three fractions (5), (6), and (7) to ultimately obtain the pure isocyanate in the middle stream (6).

8.4.3 The opponent essentially argued that the distillation conditions in (a) are known from the prior art, for example from D4, as well as the fact that in step (b) the streams are kept separate. Furthermore, the fractionation of streams (3) and (4) into three sub-streams is a simple further purification of the product streams, as in D7, and therefore obvious. For the final step (d), D11 and D12 were also cited.

The opponent further argued that step (d) is, according to the patent holder's submissions, unimportant for the claimed method, as evidenced by their submissions regarding the main request. This does not include this step. Therefore, step (d) cannot contribute to inventive step.

8.4.4 The chamber cannot agree with this.

The patent holder disputed that D11 or D12 disclose the claimed process step (d).

Even if one concedes, in the sense of the opponent, that D12 discloses a separation of a stream corresponding to the distillate stream (3) into three sub-streams, of which the middle contains the valuable product, the claimed process is still not suggested starting from D5. A skilled person would have had to take individual process steps from various complex processes described in the prior art and reassemble them. For example, they would have to use the first distillation from D4 but process the liquid stream not according to the teaching of D4 but according to the teaching of D5, and then fractionate both the gaseous stream obtained in the first step according to D4 and the gaseous stream obtained in the second step according to D5 into three parts. There is no hint to this in D5 or elsewhere. D5 does not attribute any significance to the fate of the process stream (3).

The argument that step (d) would be unimportant according to the patent holder's submissions regarding the main request is also unconvincing. The main request was denied precisely because of the absence of this step. In the present request, it is part of the method and cannot therefore be ignored in the analysis.

8.5 In summary, it can be stated that a skilled person had no reason to take individual process steps mosaic-like from the documents cited by the opponent and add them to the method of D5 to solve the stated technical problem of obtaining pure isocyanate from a crude isocyanate stream.

Inventive step is therefore present.

9. The appeal of the opponent is therefore also unfounded.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeals are dismissed.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,appeal dismissed,The Dow Chemical Company,"The Dow Chemical Company Intellectual Property 2030 Dow Center Abbott Road Midland, MI 48640 / US","Beck Greener LLP, et al, et al Fulwood House 12 Fulwood Place London WC1V 6HR / GB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeal of the appellant (opponent) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to reject its opposition against patent EP 1 413 567 under Article 101(2) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged under Articles 100(a)(b) EPC for lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC), lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC), and lack of sufficiency of disclosure (Article 83 EPC).

In the contested decision, the opposition division concluded that the claims of the granted patent were novel over D1-D4 and also inventive starting from D3 as the closest prior art. The ground for opposition under Article 100(b)/83 EPC was not admitted due to lack of substantiation under Rule 76(2)(c). Various documents were not admitted into the proceedings, in particular D7 and D8.

III. The following documents are referred to:

IV. The independent claims of the contested patent read as follows:

Claim 1:

""Process for the production of spray-dried sorbitol by spraying a 65 to 75% sorbitol solution using a rotary atomizer in a spray tower in a co-current flow with finely distributed sorbitol recirculation crystallizate, with the supply of warm air and a downstream fluidized bed for further drying of the sorbitol particles, characterized in that the sorbitol solution is adjusted to a viscosity of 8 to 50 mPa.s before being supplied to the atomizer, the atomizer is operated at a rotational speed of 5000 to 15000 rpm, recirculation crystallizate is supplied in an amount of 3 to 4 kg/kg of final product, and at the outlet of the spray tower, the temperature of the exhaust air is continuously measured and the temperature of the supplied warm air is adjusted via a control loop in a range of 105 to 150 °C, such that the exhaust air temperature is maintained at a constant value of 55 to 57 °C, with warm air being supplied in an amount of 14 to 22 m**(3)/kg of final product, and finally, the sorbitol produced at the outlet of the spray tower is directly supplied to the downstream fluidized bed, dried with warm air at a temperature of 85 to 90 °C, and finally cooled with dehumidified cold air to a temperature of 20 to 40 °C.""

Claim 8:

""Sorbitol, produced according to at least one of the preceding claims, having the following properties:

- an average particle size of 0.12 to 0.60 mm

- a bulk density of 0.53 to 0.61 kg/l

- a flow rate of at least 20 ml/s

- an angle of repose of a maximum of 33°

- a specific surface area of at least 1.4 m**(2)/g

- a dissolution time (1g sorbitol in 200 ml water at 30°C under stirring) of a maximum of 5 s.""

V. In its appeal, the appellant presents the following arguments on the relevant issues:

The ground for opposition under Article 100(b)/83 EPC should have been admitted by the opposition division, as it was substantiated. It is also justified. The subject matter of independent claims 1 and 8, as well as claims 6 and 7, is not sufficiently disclosed.

The process defined in claim 1 of the granted patent is not inventive starting from D1 as the closest prior art. The product defined in claim 8 of the granted patent is not inventive starting from D4 as the closest prior art. Therefore, the ground for opposition under Article 100(a)/56 EPC is applicable.

VI. In its response to the appeal, the respondent (patent proprietor) presents the following arguments on the relevant issues:

The ground for opposition under Article 100(b)/83 EPC was rightly not admitted into the opposition proceedings by the opposition division.

The objections raised under Article 100(a)/56 EPC are not those that were addressed in the opposition decision. Moreover, they are not correct.

VII. On October 14, 2021, the Board summoned the parties to an oral hearing on September 22, 2022.

VIII. On January 13, 2022, a communication was issued under Article 15(1) RPBA, in which the Board explained its preliminary assessment of the factual and legal situation to the parties. The Board came to the preliminary conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed.

IX. In a letter dated May 12, 2022, the appellant informed that it would not attend the scheduled oral hearing.

X. On May 23, 2022, the date for the oral hearing was canceled.

XI. The requests of the parties are as follows:

The appellant requests that the contested decision be overturned and the patent be revoked.

The respondent requests that the appeal be dismissed. Alternatively, it requests an oral hearing. It further requests that the documents D7, D8', and D14-D16 cited by the appellant not be admitted into the proceedings or that their non-admission by the opposition division be confirmed.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Decision in written proceedings

The appellant has requested oral proceedings in her appeal letter as an auxiliary measure in case the patent is not revoked in the written proceedings.

Accordingly, the Board scheduled a hearing and explained in its communication under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020 why a revocation of the patent was not to be expected. The appellant subsequently announced that she would not attend the scheduled hearing, which amounts to a withdrawal of the request for oral proceedings.

The respondent has requested oral proceedings only as an auxiliary measure in case her request for dismissal of the appeal is not granted. However, since the Board follows this request, as will be explained further below, this auxiliary request is moot.

The Board does not consider it appropriate to hold oral proceedings ex officio in the present case, Article 116(1) EPC, as the decision can be made in written proceedings based on the submissions of the parties.

3. Sufficiency of Disclosure (Article 100(b) and 83 EPC)

3.1 Admission of the ground for opposition

3.1.1 The ground for opposition based on lack of sufficiency of disclosure was not admitted into the opposition proceedings by the Opposition Division under Rule 76(2)(c) EPC. In their view, the ground for opposition was not sufficiently substantiated in the notice of opposition (see point 14 of the contested decision).

3.1.2 According to Rule 81(1) EPC, first sentence, the Opposition Division examines the grounds put forward by the opponent. However, the Opposition Division only examines those grounds that have been properly presented and substantiated by the opponent in accordance with Article 99(1) in conjunction with Rule 55(c) EPC 1973 (now Rule 76(2)(c) EPC), as established in G 10/91 (OJ EPO 1993, 420).

3.1.3 In the present case, the ground for opposition was raised under Article 100(b) EPC, as on pages 1 and 12 of the notice of opposition, revocation of the patent due to lack of sufficiency of disclosure under Article 83 EPC is requested. This was undisputed and is also stated in the contested decision.

It is correct that, as noted by the Opposition Division, the ground for opposition under Article 83 EPC is not dealt with in a separate chapter in the notice of opposition.

On the other hand, at least in the section of the notice of opposition that deals with claims 6 and 7 (pages 8 and 9), it is stated that these claims are not sufficiently disclosed. The reason given is that due to the inadequate information regarding the sieving conditions in the patent, the grain size distribution defined in the claim is not sufficiently disclosed.

For this reason alone, the ground for opposition under Article 83 EPC was substantiated and should therefore have been examined. Whether the objection is convincing or not is the result of the substantive examination by the Opposition Division, not its prerequisite. Whether other sections in the notice of opposition, such as the statements regarding the type of apparatus used on page 6, can be read as a justification for the ground for opposition is therefore irrelevant.

3.1.4 The ground for opposition based on lack of sufficiency of disclosure is therefore part of the proceedings.

3.2 The objections regarding lack of sufficiency of disclosure under Article 83 EPC raised by the appellant in the opposition proceedings and reiterated in her statement of appeal were as follows:

a) The dimensions of the apparatus used, the process conditions, and the resulting parameters such as temperature profiles, material flows, and moisture amounts are not described in detail. The process according to claim 1 cannot therefore be reproduced.

b) The water contents and grain size distributions defined in claims 6 and 7 cannot be determined by the skilled person.

c) The parameters of dissolution time and grain size defined in product claim 8 cannot be determined by the skilled person, or not with the required accuracy.

3.3 Considering the arguments presented by the parties, the Board concludes that the claimed invention is sufficiently disclosed. The reasons for this are as follows:

3.3.1 Claim 1 relates to a process for spray drying sorbitol, which is defined by individual process steps. The question is therefore whether a skilled person can carry out this process using the description in the patent and with the aid of their general technical knowledge.

The preamble of the claim defines a process for spray drying sorbitol by atomizing a sorbitol solution using a rotary atomizer in a spray tower. The process operates in a co-current manner, circulating finely distributed sorbitol crystals, supplying warm air, and using a fluidized bed for the subsequent drying of the particles. This does not present an insurmountable technical hurdle; the appellant herself has argued in her statements on inventive step that such a process is known from D1 and D2 (features (a) to (d) of her chosen feature listing). The characterizing part of the claim refers to the viscosity of the sorbitol solution used, the rotational speed of the atomizer, and temperatures of material flows that are to be set to values defined in the claim. Exemplary process parameters are provided in Table 1.

The appellant has not provided any reason why a skilled person should not be able to conduct a process in the claimed manner. It may be that, as argued by the appellant, the dimensions of the apparatus used influence how the parameters defined in the claimed process must be set. However, it has not been explained why setting, for example, temperatures, crystallization amounts, or atomizer rotational speeds would present an insurmountable obstacle for the skilled person.

3.3.2 Claims 6 and 7 define that after the fluidized bed treatment or as end products, sorbitol with a specific water content and a specific grain size distribution is obtained. Paragraph [0004] of the patent describes the measures by which these properties of the product are achieved, among other things by ensuring that the water content of the sorbitol when leaving the spray tower is already relatively low, so that larger aggregates do not form during the process.

The appellant has argued that the grain size varies depending on the sieve fraction and is dependent on the pre-treatment and the duration of sieving.

The respondent has argued, and the Board agrees, that a skilled person knows that sieving is carried out until sieve consistency is achieved on the individual sieves. Mechanical sieving is a standard procedure, and Table 2 provides grain sizes and their distributions. The various grain sizes are obtained according to Table 1 depending on the process parameters used. Whether the measurement of the grain sizes is associated with inaccuracies, as claimed by the appellant, is, if at all, a clarity issue that must remain unconsidered here. Lack of clarity under Article 84 EPC is not a ground for opposition under Article 100 EPC.

3.3.3 Claim 8 defines a sorbitol that can be produced by the claimed process and meets various specifications. Such sorbitol is obtained, for example, in the examples listed in Table 2.

The appellant does not dispute that the sorbitol can be obtained. However, she disputes that the parameters defined in claim 8, particularly the grain size and dissolution time, can be determined with sufficient accuracy. There are various methods for their determination, and the method used in the patent is not sufficiently disclosed. This point also refers to documents D7 and D14-D16.

However, this argument concerns the question of whether a skilled person is able to determine whether a specific product they have at hand meets the required parameters or not, i.e., whether it falls under the claim or not. Unclear claim boundaries are, if this were the case, a clarity issue under Article 84 EPC. The question of whether a skilled person can obtain the claimed product using the method described in the patent is unaffected by this. Clarity is, as already mentioned above, not a ground for opposition. The documents cited by the appellant that concern the accuracy of the measurement methods are therefore irrelevant to the decision, regardless of admissibility issues.

4. Novelty (Article 100(a) and 54 EPC)

The Opposition Division found in its decision that the subject matter of the independent claims meets the novelty criterion, see point 15 of the contested decision.

This was not disputed in the statement of appeal. Novelty is therefore given.

5. Inventive Step (Article 100(a) and 56 EPC)

5.1 In the opposition proceedings, the appellant as the opponent challenged the inventive step starting from D3 as the closest prior art during the oral proceedings, see pages 2 and 3 of the minutes. Other lines of argument presented in the notice of opposition or later in the course of the opposition proceedings were not pursued further. Accordingly, inventive step was addressed in the contested decision solely starting from D3, see point 16 of the reasons for the decision.

5.2 In her statement of appeal, the appellant does not address the decision of the Opposition Division at all. She neither argues that the subject matter of the independent claims is obvious to the skilled person starting from D3, nor does she argue that and why D3 does not represent the closest prior art contrary to the view held by both parties in the opposition proceedings and thus adopted in the opposition decision.

Instead, the appellant raises objections starting from D1 (claim 1) or D4 (claim 8), which were indeed presented in her notice of opposition or in later submissions during the opposition proceedings but were not pursued further in the course of those proceedings. In this context, document D8' is also mentioned.

5.3 The Board does not admit this submission under Article 12(4) RPBA 2007, which applies here according to the transitional provisions in Article 25 RPBA 2020.

According to Article 12(2) RPBA 2007, to which the aforementioned Article 12(4) refers, the statement of appeal must indicate the reasons why the contested decision should be set aside. This has not been done with respect to Article 56 EPC. The appeal proceedings primarily serve to judicially review the contested decision and not to revive lines of argument that were abandoned during the opposition proceedings and therefore not addressed in the contested decision for the first time in the appeal proceedings.

5.4 The appellant has not further commented on this point addressed in the Board's communication under Article 15(3) RPBA 2020 in the subsequent proceedings.

5.5 The decision of the Opposition Division that D3 is the document representing the closest prior art and that the subject matter of the independent claims is based on inventive step starting from D3 is undisputed.

5.6 Inventive step is therefore given.

6. In summary, it can be stated that the decision of the Opposition Division to reject the opposition stands even after the submissions of the parties in the appeal proceedings.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",opposition rejected,opposition rejected,appeal dismissed,Merck Patent GmbH,Merck Patent GmbH Postfach Frankfurter Strasse 250 64293 Darmstadt / DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IV. An opposition was filed against the grant of the patent in dispute. This was based on the grounds that the subject matter of the patent in dispute is not novel, not inventive, and not sufficiently disclosed, and furthermore goes beyond the content of the application as originally filed (Articles 100 a), b) and c) EPC).

V. The main request of the patent holder in the opposition proceedings was the rejection of the opposition and consequently the maintenance of the patent in dispute in the granted version. Additionally, 21 auxiliary requests were submitted in the form of further sets of claims.

VI. The present appeal of the patent holder (appellant) is directed against the decision of the opposition division announced in the oral proceedings on December 3, 2018, and sent by post on January 10, 2019, to revoke the patent in dispute.

VII. In the matter, the opposition division reached the following conclusions in the contested decision:

a) The subject matter of claim 1 in the granted version (main request) goes beyond the content of the application as originally filed (Articles 100 c) and 123(2) EPC).

b) The auxiliary requests I and II submitted during the oral proceedings before the opposition division were admitted into the proceedings.

c) The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request I also goes beyond the content of the application as originally filed (Article 123(2) EPC). The changes made also create a lack of clarity regarding the ranges of amounts (Article 84 EPC).

d) Auxiliary request II, on the other hand, meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, but the subject matter claimed therein is insufficiently disclosed (Article 83 EPC).

e) The subject matter of claim 1 in each of auxiliary requests 3 to 21 goes beyond the content of the application as originally filed (Article 123(2) EPC).

VIII. The patent holder (appellant) filed an appeal against this decision.

In its statement of grounds of appeal, it requested as a main request the rejection of the opposition (corresponding to the maintenance of the patent in dispute in the granted version) and submitted an auxiliary request designated as 'main request' and auxiliary requests I, I' to IX, IX', as well as X, XI, and XII.

Auxiliary request XI was submitted for the first time in the appeal proceedings. All other requests correspond - except for their numbering and corresponding ranking - to the requests dealt with in the contested decision.

""wherein the pH of the composition is adjusted and/or maintained in the range of 5.2 to 5.9,""

has been changed to:

""wherein the pH of the composition is adjusted and/or maintained in the range of 5.2 to 5.9.""

X. The full text of claim 1 of auxiliary request XII is as follows (changes compared to claim 1 of the granted version are highlighted):

1. Pharmaceutical composition with improved stability for topical application for the treatment of rhinitis, wherein the composition is in the form of an aqueous composition and wherein the composition contains:

a) at least one imidazoline-based alpha-sympathomimetic or its physiologically acceptable salt, wherein the imidazoline-based alpha-sympathomimetic is selected from xylometazoline and wherein the composition contains component a), based on the composition, in an amount of 0.04 to 0.2 wt. %;

b) Panthenol (Dexpanthenol), wherein the composition contains component b), based on the composition, in an amount of 3 to 6 wt. %;

and

c) at least one preservative and/or disinfectant, wherein the preservative and/or disinfectant is selected from benzalkonium chloride and wherein the composition contains component c), based on the composition, in an amount of 0.01 to 0.5 wt. %;

wherein the pH of the composition is adjusted and/or maintained in the range of 5.2 to 5.9, wherein the adjustment and/or maintenance of the pH of the composition is carried out by means of at least one chemical buffer system, wherein an alkali dihydrogen phosphate/alkali monohydrogen phosphate buffer system is used as the chemical buffer system,

wherein the composition contains a content of degradation product(s) of active ingredient a) of at most 1 wt. %, based on active ingredient a), even after storage of the composition at temperatures in the range of 20°C to 50°C, at a pressure of 1,013.25 mbar and at a relative humidity in the range of 50% to 90% for at least 6 months, and

wherein the composition contains a content of degradation product(s) of active ingredient b) of at most 1 wt. %, based on active ingredient b), even after storage of the composition at temperatures in the range of 20°C to 50°C, at a pressure of 1,013.25 mbar and at a relative humidity in the range of 50% to 90% for at least 6 months.

XI. In its response to the appeal dated September 27, 2019, the opponent (respondent) argued, among other things, that none of the present requests meet the requirements of Article 123(2). This applies in particular to auxiliary request XII (identical to the earlier auxiliary request II dealt with in the contested decision), as the claimed combination of features does not emerge clearly and directly from the original version of the application (see Section 2, in particular point 2.5 of the response to the appeal).

XII. In accordance with the relevant requests of the parties involved, the Board summoned to an oral hearing.

In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA dated October 8, 2021, the Board explained its preliminary assessment, including the evaluation of the substantive requests of the appellant under Article 100 c) or 123(2) EPC (see Section 4 of the communication).

According to this preliminary assessment, the combination of features defined in claim 1 of the main request lacks a basis in the form of a direct and unambiguous disclosure in the originally filed version of the application. This is also expected to apply to the claims of all auxiliary requests including auxiliary request XII.

XIII. By letter dated November 12, 2021, the appellant submitted another set of claims as auxiliary request XIII.

XIV. At the request of the respondent (see letter dated September 23, 2021) and taking into account the current pandemic situation, the Board decided (Article 15a(1) RPBA) to hold the oral hearing scheduled for December 22, 2021, as a video conference, which was communicated to the parties involved by letter dated December 3, 2021.

The counter-request of the appellant to conduct the hearing as an in-person event or, alternatively, in a hybrid format with the respondent participating via video transmission (see letter from the appellant dated October 8, 2021) was therefore not granted.

XV. The oral hearing scheduled for December 22, 2021, had to be postponed due to illness. A new date, still in the format of a video conference, was set for February 8, 2022.

XVI. By letter dated December 23, 2021 (as previously also with letter dated November 15, 2021), the respondent requested that the announced accompanying person, patent attorney candidate Ms. Quinten, be allowed to present in the oral hearing under the supervision of the authorized representative Ms. Gundel on the ground of opposition under Article 100 c) EPC.

XVII. By letter dated January 6, 2022, the appellant again requested that the hearing be conducted as an in-person event (""live hearing"") or, alternatively, postponed to summer 2022 to allow for an in-person event. Furthermore, the appellant requested that the announced presentation by Ms. Quinten should not be allowed.

XVIII. The Board then informed the parties involved through its registry that the hearing would still take place on February 8, 2022, as a video conference.

XIX. The composition of the Board changed due to the exchange of the legally qualified member, of which the parties involved were informed in a communication from the Board dated February 8, 2022 (previously by email on February 7, 2022).

XX. The oral hearing took place on February 8, 2022, as a video conference.

The request of the appellant for a postponement to allow for an in-person hearing was not granted.

The Board decided to allow the presentation by Ms. Quinten, which had been announced in advance by the respondent (see point XVI above).

During the hearing, the appellant recorded the following objections under Rule 106 EPC:

(i) In the event that auxiliary request XIII is not admitted at this time, the appellant raises an objection against Article 113 (1) EPC.

(ii) The rejection of the request for postponement and the non-conduct of the hearing as an in-person hearing is also raised as a violation of Article 113 (1) EPC.

The Board rejected the objections under Rule 106 EPC after deliberation.

XXI. The arguments of the appellant can be summarized as follows:

Presentation by Ms. Quinten

The presentation by Ms. Quinten should not be allowed, as she is not an authorized representative.

Format of the oral hearing, request for postponement or adjournment (Article 15a(1) RPBA)

In the context of a video conference, complex issues cannot be adequately presented and discussed, which would severely disadvantage the appellant.

Furthermore, the conditions set forth by the decision G 1/21 of the Enlarged Board of Appeal dated July 16, 2021, for conducting the hearing as a video conference are not met in this case. With appropriate vaccination protection, the participating individuals are not prevented from traveling and appearing in person at the hearing on site. All institutions based in Germany, including courts and offices, have been conducting in-person hearings with appropriate hygiene measures for a long time and extensively. Other events, such as concerts, are also taking place with a high number of participants.

Additionally, the Board was recently reconstituted, so that in the new composition there was not enough preparation time for the hearing.

Changes (Articles 100 c) and 123(2) EPC)

The basis for the subject matter of claim 1 of the patent in dispute arises from the preferred embodiment according to claim 6 (and also page 10, paragraph 1) of the originally filed version of the application, which already specifically foresees the combination of xylometazoline with panthenol.

The description of the application does not merely reflect the sequence of claims but also establishes a connection between their features. For example, it becomes clear from the context of the application that the concentrations of xylometazoline and panthenol should correlate with each other, as the addition of panthenol serves to counteract the drying out of the nasal mucosa caused by xylometazoline.

Since the invention aims to stabilize the active ingredients against hydrolytic degradation in an aqueous medium, the claimed composition can only exist as an aqueous preparation that necessarily has a pH value. The specification of the pH range and the active ingredient concentrations are merely concretizations of technically mandatory features. In this context, a listing of various preferred pH or concentration ranges provides a clear preference and does not represent a list of equivalent alternatives.

The clearly preferred pH range of 5.2-5.9 is technically directly related to its maintenance through a buffer system, wherein a phosphate buffer is indicated in the application as the only suitable embodiment. Similarly, benzalkonium chloride is disclosed as the only embodiment of a preservative (serving additional stabilization and therefore preferred) used in the examples of the application.

Thus, these components form a pre-defined matrix. It is evident from the application as a whole that the skilled person can combine various ranges and additional features as if using a modular system to achieve the desired stability according to the invention. This does not constitute a violation of Article 123(2) EPC, even in light of the arbitrariness of the references in the claims. Therefore, the subject matter of granted claim 1 does not go beyond the content of the originally filed application.

Even less so is this the case for claim 1 of auxiliary request XII, which is based on the combination of the most preferred concentration ranges of the application. The only selection made in the context of the disclosure of the application to arrive at the subject matter of the claim is the choice of the strictest requirement regarding the stability criteria. Support for compliance with these criteria can be particularly seen from the data for composition 4B in Table 4 on page 35 of the original application documents.

Admission of auxiliary request XIII (Article 13(2) RPBA)

The submission of auxiliary request XIII represents a direct response to the unexpected assertion of the Board of Appeal that the current auxiliary request XII does not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, which objection was raised for the first time by the Board and differs from the opinion of the opposition division. Auxiliary request XIII is also suitable to address all objections under Articles 123(2) and 83 EPC. The changes made are not complex and do not raise new questions. Thus, the request should be admitted in the described procedural situation to ensure the appellant's right to be heard.

XXII. The arguments of the respondent can be summarized as follows:

Format of the oral hearing, request for postponement or adjournment (Article 15a(1) RPBA)

In light of the rising COVID-19 infection numbers, it is appropriate for individual as well as general health protection to hold the oral hearing as a video conference. Since the pandemic is still ongoing, the situation corresponds to that in the case underlying G 1/21.

Although the format of a video conference may not be the best option for an oral hearing, no disadvantage can arise for either party as long as both participate equally via video transmission (no ""hybrid"" format).

The date for the oral hearing has already been postponed once. Furthermore, there has already been a delay in the proceedings before the opposition division due to a postponement. A further adjournment would be contrary to the interests of the respondent and the public in an efficient continuation of the proceedings.

Changes (Articles 100 c) and 123(2) EPC)

Only through multiple selections is it possible to move from the content of the application as originally filed to the subject matter of granted claim 1 or the other independent claims of the patent in dispute. This does not meet the sole relevant criterion according to the decision of the Enlarged Board of Appeal in G 2/10 (OJ EPO, 2012, 376), which states that the claimed combination of features must be directly and unambiguously disclosed in the original version of the application to comply with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

The distinction made by the appellant in this context between ""selection"" and ""concretization"" of features is artificial and not comprehensible.

The same objection applies to all auxiliary requests including auxiliary request XII. In these requests, various features are also arbitrarily combined (""cherry-picking""). In particular, there is no compelling connection between the selection of narrower concentration ranges for the components of the claimed composition and the establishment of lower limits for the content of degradation products after storage.

Admission of auxiliary request XIII (Article 13(2) RPBA)

The objection that auxiliary request XII (identical to auxiliary request II of the contested decision) does not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC has been consistently raised by the respondent from the beginning, both in the oral proceedings before the opposition division and in the response to the appeal. Therefore, the now belated submission of auxiliary request XIII aimed at addressing this well-known objection is not justified by a new development in the sense of an extraordinary circumstance according to Article 13(2) RPBA.

Requests of the Parties Involved

XXIII. The appellant requested the annulment of the contested decision.

In the event that it is determined in the appeal proceedings that the subject matter of one of the requests under consideration is sufficiently disclosed, does not go beyond the content of the original application, and does not give rise to a clarity objection due to the changes made, the appellant primarily requests the referral of the matter back to the opposition division for further decision on patentability.

The present requests were as follows:

- Main request: granted version of the patent in dispute,

- Main request': first submitted with letter dated October 2, 2018, identical to auxiliary request 3 of the contested decision;

- Auxiliary requests I-IX, all first submitted with letter dated January 15, 2018, identical to auxiliary requests 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 of the contested decision;

- Auxiliary requests I'-IX', all first submitted with letter dated October 2, 2018, identical to auxiliary requests 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21 of the contested decision;

Each of the requests marked with ' follows immediately in ranking after the request with the corresponding number without '.

- Auxiliary request X, first submitted as auxiliary request I in the oral proceedings before the opposition division;

- Auxiliary request XI, first submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal;

- Auxiliary request XII, first submitted as auxiliary request II in the oral proceedings before the opposition division; and

- Auxiliary request XIII, submitted with letter dated November 12, 2021.

In the alternative to its request for referral, the appellant requested the rejection of the opposition and the maintenance of the patent in dispute in the granted version,

or otherwise, further alternatively, the maintenance of the patent in dispute in amended form based on the claims according to main request' or one of the mentioned auxiliary requests.

The appellant also requested the non-admission of documents D6 and D18 to D24.

XXIV. The respondent requested the rejection of the appeal.

In this context, it further requested the non-admission of auxiliary requests XI and XIII.

In the event that it is determined in the appeal proceedings that the subject matter of one of the requests under consideration is sufficiently disclosed, does not go beyond the content of the original application, and does not give rise to a clarity objection due to the changes made, the respondent requested the referral of the matter back to the opposition division for further decision on patentability.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Admissibility of the Appeal

The appeal meets the requirements under Articles 106 to 108 EPC and Rule 99 EPC; it is admissible.

2. Presentation by an Accompanying Person

2.1 For the admission of oral statements by an accompanying person at an oral hearing in the appeal procedure concerning opposition, which must relate to specific legal or technical questions, the discretionary criteria mentioned in decision G 4/95 of the Enlarged Board of Appeal apply (OJ EPO 7/1996, 412).

2.2 In the present case, the oral statements concern the specific question of whether the subject matter claimed in the present applications (claim sets) goes beyond the content of the application in its original form (Article 100 c) or 123(2) EPC). The corresponding presentation was announced by the authorized representative of the opponent five weeks before the originally scheduled hearing date, specifying the name and qualifications of the accompanying person, with the indication that this presentation would take place under her supervision. Immediately after the announcement of the changed new hearing date, the opponent stated that it still maintained its request to allow the presentation of the accompanying person (see above, Points XV. and XVI.).

2.3 Accordingly, the criteria defined in the decision formula of G 4/95 i), ii), and iv) are met. The case underlying criterion iii) (request made shortly before or during the oral hearing) is not present here.

2.4 The appellant's argument that the accompanying person is not an authorized representative is not valid, as according to G 4/95, the presentation by accompanying persons who are not authorized representatives is not excluded from the outset.

2.5 For these reasons, the Board decided to allow the oral presentation of the accompanying person (Ms. Quinten) under the supervision of the authorized representative (Ms. Gundel).

3. Amendments (Article 100 c) / 123(2) EPC)

3.1 To assess whether the claimed subject matter goes beyond the content of the application in its originally filed form, it must be determined whether the claimed combination of features is disclosed directly and unambiguously in the originally filed application (in light of the general knowledge relevant to the filing date) (""gold standard"", see G 1/16, OJ EPO 2018, 70, Reasons 17, 18).

3.2 In her reasoning as to why there is no impermissible extension in the sense of Article 100 c)/123(2) EPC, the appellant referred to claim 6 of the original application, which should be combined with the content of the description.

3.3 Auxiliary Request XII

3.3.1 Claim 6 of the originally filed application relates to an embodiment in which xylometazoline (or its salts) is present together with panthenol (or its esters), preferably panthenol (see also page 10, paragraph 1 of the description). Thus, the active ingredient combination of xylometazoline or its salts with panthenol is originally disclosed.

3.3.2 This, like all application-compliant formulations, has a pH in the range of 5.0 to 6.2 (see claim 1, from which claim 6 depends, as well as page 12, lines 12 to 20). From this and from the context presented in the application that aims for stabilization of the active ingredients in an aqueous system, it is evident that it is an aqueous composition (page 5, line 11, to page 6, line 2; page 7, line 35 to page 8, line 21).

3.3.3 Furthermore, the description of the application states:

- that the range of 5.2 to 5.9 is the most preferred pH range (page 12, lines 12 to 20);

- that the pH range is typically to be maintained constant with the help of a buffer system (page 12, lines 22 to 32);

- that a phosphate buffer system, particularly a potassium dihydrogen phosphate/sodium monohydrogen phosphate buffer, leads to significantly better results regarding long-term stabilization than other buffer systems (page 13);

- that optionally a preservative and/or disinfectant may be included, with benzalkonium chloride being particularly preferred as such (page 14, paragraph 1).

3.3.4 The general manufacturing instructions for the example formulations described in the application, which are aqueous compositions, already specify the adjustment of the pH to the particularly preferred range between 5.2 and 5.9 (see page 20, line 5 to page 21, line 2).

All ten described example formulations contain a potassium dihydrogen phosphate/sodium monohydrogen phosphate buffer and 5 wt.-% panthenol (= dexpanthenol). Of the six formulations that contain xylometazoline hydrochloride at concentrations of 0.05 or 0.1 wt.-%, four, namely formulations 5, 7, 9, and 10, also contain 0.02 wt.-% benzalkonium chloride, the only preservative used in the example formulations.

3.3.5 Regarding the qualitative and quantitative composition of the ingredients, these four formulations are indeed compliant with claim 1 of auxiliary request XII (though more narrowly defined regarding the buffer components and limited to xylometazoline hydrochloride); however, no further details are provided regarding possible concentration ranges and storage stability that correspond to the mandatory features defined in claim 1.

3.3.6 Considering the general disclosure in the description and the relevant example formulations (Points 3.3.3 to 3.3.5), it can at least be acknowledged that the embodiment in which the active ingredients xylometazoline and panthenol are combined with benzalkonium chloride in the most preferred pH range finds a sufficient basis in the original application.

3.3.7 The appellant argued that the concentration ranges mentioned in claim 1 of auxiliary request XII (0.04 to 0.2 wt.-% xylometazoline or its salt; 3 to 6 wt.-% panthenol; 0.01 to 0.05 wt.-% preservative) represent the most preferred ranges mentioned in the application and that a combination of the most preferred ranges is fundamentally derivable in a clear manner for the skilled person from the application, as this logically must also be the best possible embodiment.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request XII also adopts, for the generally disclosed minimum storage duration in the application, the strictest (i.e., best possible) stability criteria regarding the degradation products (at most 1 wt.-% based on active ingredient a) and at most 1 wt.-% based on active ingredient b)). These criteria are additionally supported by the inventive example 4B according to Table 4 on page 35 of the application.

Finally, the potassium dihydrogen phosphate/sodium monohydrogen phosphate buffer mentioned in the formulation examples, together with the reference in the description to the potassium dihydrogen phosphate/sodium monohydrogen phosphate buffer, is sufficient to support the feature of potassium dihydrogen phosphate/sodium monohydrogen phosphate buffer.

Thus, the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request XII as a whole finds the necessary basis in the original application.

3.3.8 The Board arrives at a different conclusion for the following reasons.

a) As the opponent has already correctly pointed out in point 2.5 of the response to the appeal, the specification of the content of degradation products at a maximum of 1 wt.-% is not necessarily linked to the choice of the most preferred average concentration range for the content of the active ingredients.

The specification of the tolerated content of degradation products after the minimum storage duration of 6 months is rather arbitrary and independent of the other technical features, once for the degradation products of active ingredient a) and once for those of active ingredient b). Therefore, more than a selection within the framework provided by the application must be made to arrive at the claimed subject matter.

b) Regarding the argument of support by Table 4, the following should be noted:

The formulation according to example 4B on page 35 of the application apparently corresponds to the example formulation 5 indicated on page 22 (which has not been disputed). Stability data for the content of degradation products after a storage duration of 6 months are provided in Table 4 on page 35.

The results observed for the content of degradation products after a storage duration of 6 months were therefore within the limits specified in claim 1 of auxiliary request XII. However, this cannot be considered a sufficient basis in the original application in the sense of Article 123(2) EPC: The storage test was conducted only with a single formulation and only for storage at a temperature of 25°C ± 2°C and a relative humidity of 60% ± 5% (see page 25, lines 6 to 15), corresponding to the mildest conditions mentioned in the application. In contrast, claim 1 covers a range of different formulations and requires compliance with the stability criteria even for storage under more demanding conditions, namely temperatures up to 50°C and relative humidity of up to 90%.

c) Furthermore, there are also doubts as to whether the combination of the narrowest concentration ranges of 0.04 to 0.20 wt.-% and 3-6 wt.-% for active ingredients a) and b) is disclosed directly and unambiguously in the application. The description explicitly states that the concentrations of both active ingredients, and also the ratio of the active ingredients to each other, can vary within wide ranges (see page 10, line 21 to page 11, line 26 of the description). These statements do not necessarily lead to the combination of the narrowest (average) concentration ranges, nor do they suggest a correlation between these ranges that should be particularly considered to arrive at the best possible embodiment.

d) In this context, it should be noted that there is no automaticity whereby the combination of the most preferred embodiments of different, independent technical features would always be implicitly disclosed and thus could not involve a selection. Rather, the assessment of this question must depend on the specific circumstances of the individual case.

e) Finally, the application also provides a number of differently broad concentration ranges that relate to a preservative and/or disinfectant in general, but not specifically to benzalkonium chloride (page 14, lines 16 to 21). These statements do not provide a clear and direct disclosure of the concentration range of 0.01 to 0.5 wt.-% benzalkonium chloride in combination with specific concentration ranges of active ingredients a) and b).

3.3.9 For these reasons, the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request XII goes beyond the content of the application in its originally filed form.

3.4 Main Request

3.4.1 Claim 1 of the main request differs from claim 1 of auxiliary request XII particularly in the specifications for the concentration ranges of the components and the maximum content of degradation products of a) and b).

3.4.2 The situation already discussed in the context of auxiliary request XII, that more than one specification or selection decision must be made within the information contained in the application to arrive at a claimed subject matter that specifies concrete ranges for all these features, does not fundamentally change.

3.4.3 The original claim 6 does not contain concentration specifications. The description provides various selection options in this regard (content of degradation products: page 17, lines 4 to 22; active ingredient concentrations: page 10, line 21 to page 11, line 11; concentration of preservative: page 14, lines 16 to 21). That these options (in contrast to non-overlapping alternatives) represent a broadest range and its increasingly narrow subranges does not change the fact that a specification of a specific range is required, and thus the combinations of the selected ranges are not disclosed directly and unambiguously in the original documents of the application.

3.4.4 According to the appellant's argument regarding the main request, it would be clear to the skilled person that within the framework mainly formed by the qualitative composition of the claimed embodiment, the further features can be combined arbitrarily like in a modular system.

3.4.5 However, the fact that based on such considerations certain combinations of features would be recognized as compliant with the application or inventive does not represent a clear and direct disclosure of these specific combinations of features.

3.4.6 Thus, the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request also goes beyond the content of the application in its originally filed form.

3.5 Main Request' and Auxiliary Requests I-X, I'-IX'

3.5.1 The reasons for the decision regarding claim 1 according to the main request and auxiliary request XII apply correspondingly to claim 1 of the main request' and the auxiliary requests I-X and I' to IX'.

3.5.2 The subject matter of the respective claim 1 of these requests also goes beyond the content of the application in its originally filed form.

4. Auxiliary Request XI - Admission, Amendments

4.1 The Board sees no valid reason not to admit auxiliary request XI under Article 12(4) RPBA 2007.

4.2 Since claim 1 of this request has the same wording as claim 1 of auxiliary request X, auxiliary request XI also does not meet the criterion of Article 123(2) EPC for the same reasons and is therefore not allowable.

5. Auxiliary Request XIII - Admission and Objection under Rule 106 EPC

5.1 Auxiliary request XIII consists of a single claim, which according to the appellant refers to the formulation under number 4B on page 35 of the granted version of the application. This claim defines, among other things, specific concentrations and storage conditions (0.1 wt.-% xylometazoline hydrochloride, 5 wt.-% panthenol, 0.02% benzalkonium chloride, 25°C ± 2°C, 60% ± 5% relative humidity).

5.2 The new claim in the proceedings according to auxiliary request XIII represents a change in the appellant's submissions. The request was submitted after the summons to the oral hearing was issued. Therefore, its admission is subject to the provisions of Article 13(2) RPBA.

5.3 In its communication under Article 15(1) RPBA, the Board had aligned its preliminary opinion with that of the opponent, that none of the present requests met the criterion under Article 123(2) EPC (see above, Point XII. and the Board's communication, Section 4, in particular 4.1 and 4.4). Regarding the question of sufficiency of disclosure, essentially only the file situation including the arguments of the parties was referenced.

5.4 According to the appellant, the content of this communication was surprising for her. Therefore, due to exceptional circumstances, auxiliary request XIII should be admitted as a legitimate reaction to the Board's preliminary opinion. Otherwise, the right to be heard for the appellant would not be guaranteed.

5.5 The Board cannot agree with this view for the following reasons:

5.5.1 The objection that in particular the subject matter of auxiliary request XII (identical to auxiliary request II in the proceedings before the opposition division) goes beyond the content of the application in its originally filed form due to a lack of specific disclosure was already known in the proceedings, as the opponent had consistently argued this both in the oral proceedings before the opposition division and in her response to the appeal (see minutes of the oral proceedings of December 3, 2018, page 3, lines 1-2; response to the appeal, Section 2, in particular Point 2.5).

5.5.2 The appellant could therefore have expressed herself on the objection known to her since the beginning of the appeal proceedings (Article 113(1) EPC).

5.5.3 That the Board could align itself with an objection from the opposing party, even differing from the opinion of the opposition division, is a development that is always conceivable in appeal proceedings, which cannot therefore be regarded as surprising.

5.5.4 If another auxiliary request had been intended as a fallback position for such a case, the appellant should have submitted such a request earlier in the appeal proceedings, as the objection in question was already known to her, rather than waiting another two years after receiving the response to the appeal.

5.5.5 The appellant's argument that the Board had argued in detail differently than the opposition division or at least more detailed than the opponent is not valid. Essentially, the Board's statement was the same as that of the opponent, namely that the feature combination defined in the relevant claim is not disclosed directly and unambiguously in the originally filed version of the application and that this is the decisive criterion for assessing amendments under Article 123(2) EPC.

5.6 Since the appellant has not demonstrated valid reasons for the existence of exceptional circumstances that could justify the late submission of auxiliary request XIII, this request must remain disregarded in accordance with Article 13(2) RPBA.

5.7 Accordingly, the appellant's objection under Rule 106 EPC against the non-admission of auxiliary request XIII (see above, Point XX.(i)) was dismissed during the oral proceedings.

6. Format of the Oral Hearing as a Videoconference and Objection under Rule 106 EPC

6.1 Considering the pandemic situation and the complexity of the issues to be addressed, the Board deemed it appropriate to conduct the oral hearing in the format of a videoconference (Article 15a(1) RPBA).

6.2 In its decision G1/21, the Enlarged Board of Appeal decided that oral proceedings before the Boards of Appeal of the EPO can be held as a videoconference without the consent of all parties under certain circumstances. This is permissible when a general emergency exists that affects the ability of the parties to participate in an in-person hearing (see G1/21: decision formula and Reasons 48 to 51).

6.3 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a continuing ""general emergency"" in the sense of the aforementioned decision even during the period from December 2021 to February 2022. This phase was characterized in Germany by high incidence rates of infections with the Delta variant of the coronavirus and simultaneously sharply rising incidence rates of infections with the Omicron variant. Even vaccinated individuals, with hygiene measures in place, would have been exposed to an increased risk of infection during travel and the conduct of an in-person hearing. Therefore, the situation, in the Board's opinion, corresponded to that mentioned in G1/21, and the concerns of the opponent regarding the limitation of her ability to participate in an in-person hearing appeared justified.

6.4 Furthermore, the present appeal case did not present any legal or technical peculiarities that would have led the Board to assume that an adequate presentation by the parties could only be ensured in the context of an in-person hearing. It was also not apparent why the format of a videoconference, as claimed by the appellant, would disadvantage her compared to the opponent.

6.5 The hybrid format proposed in advance by the appellant (but rejected by the opponent), whereby one party would participate in person and the other via video connection (see above, Point XIV.), was not feasible in this case (hearing with simultaneous translation) due to technical conditions.

6.6 The general reference to practices of other bodies (courts, offices) cannot replace or undermine the Board's own discretion in light of the circumstances of the specific case at hand. Participation in concert or sporting events is voluntary and therefore not comparable.

6.7 The appellant's request for a postponement to a later date in the summer appeared unacceptable in the interest of the generally sought timely resolution of the proceedings, as the oral hearing had already been postponed once and it was also unclear when the pandemic situation would actually allow for an in-person hearing.

6.8 The change in the composition of the Board (see above, Point XIX.) could not justify a postponement either. From the appellant's submissions, it was not evident why adequate preparation for the oral hearing by the Board in the new composition would not have been possible. In particular, the timing of the announcement of the reappointment (on which the appellant based her objection) is not decisive for the available preparation time.

6.9 For these reasons, the Board exercised its discretion under Article 15a(1) RPBA to schedule the oral hearing as a videoconference and did not grant the appellant's request for a postponement on the day of the hearing itself. Since the appellant was able to present fully on all issues to be discussed, the right to be heard was preserved.

6.10 The related objection of the appellant under Rule 106 EPC (see above, Point XX.(ii)) was therefore dismissed during the oral proceedings.

7. Admission of Evidence

7.1 The Board did not rely on any of the documents D6 or D18-D24 in its reasons for the decision above, so it was not necessary to decide on the appellant's request for their non-admission.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,Strawman Limited,"Strawman Limited Orchard Lea Horns Lane Combe, Witney Oxfordshire OX29 8NH / GB","Gundel, Isabelle Haleon CH SARL Route de l'Etraz 1260 Nyon / CH",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. European Patent No. 2 797 588 (hereinafter: the Patent) was granted with thirteen claims.

The granted product claim 1 reads:

""Transdermal therapeutic system (TTS), comprising a drug-impermeable backing layer, a matrix consisting of one, two, or more layer(s), and a removable protective layer, characterized in that the matrix layer(s) or at least one of the matrix layers comprises/contains at least one adhesive, at least one active ingredient, and particles of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, and that during the production of the active ingredient-containing matrix layer(s) and/or the coating of the drug-impermeable backing layer of the transdermal therapeutic system, a temperature treatment was carried out, wherein the temperature was above the melting point or melting range, preferably at least 10 °C above the melting point or melting range, of the stable modification of the active ingredient(s), wherein the adhesive is a hot melt adhesive.""

The granted process claim 8 reads:

""Process for producing a TTS, comprising

a) producing an active ingredient-containing adhesive mass, comprising at least one adhesive, at least one active ingredient, and particles of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, wherein the adhesive is a hot melt adhesive and the active ingredient and the polyvinylpyrrolidone particles are dispersed in the hot melt adhesive;

b) coating a film- or foil-like polymer carrier with the active ingredient-containing adhesive mass;

characterized in that during the production a temperature treatment is carried out, wherein the temperature is above the melting point or melting range of the stable modification of the active ingredient(s).""

II. An opposition was filed against the grant of the patent. The grounds for opposition included lack of novelty and lack of inventive step under Article 100 a) EPC as well as insufficient disclosure under Article 100 b) EPC.

The appeal of the opponent (hereinafter: the appellant) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to reject the opposition.

In the contested decision, the opposition division cited inter alia the following documents:

O1: WO2008/115317

O2: JPH10-306023

O2a: Machine-translated version of O2

O3: US 2005/0260254

O4: WO 00/45797

O12: Excerpt from Römpp Chemielexikon on Olanzapine

In the contested decision, the opposition division reached the following conclusions:

a) There were no serious doubts about the feasibility of the claimed invention.

b) The transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) claimed in the patent represented a multiple selection with respect to the particulate crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone and the hot melt process used for its production compared to document O1.

There was also a multiple selection regarding the crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone and the hot melt process with respect to the teaching of document O2a.

The heat treatment defined in the claims implied the molecular dispersion of the active ingredient in the matrix layer. Document O4 did not describe a TTS in which the active ingredient was present in a molecularly dispersed form.

The subject matter of the claims was thus novel.

c) The closest prior art was document O1. The subject matter of the claims solved the problem of providing a TTS with higher stability against recrystallization in a straightforward manner. The skilled person could not derive any indication of the successful patented solution to the mentioned problem from the prior art. Furthermore, document O1 did not prompt the skilled person to use crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone in particulate form in a hot melt process, as the application of the hot melt process is known to depend on a variety of critical variables, including suitable additives.

The subject matter of the claims thus also involved an inventive step.

III. In her statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant disputed the novelty of the subject matter claimed in the patent with respect to documents O1, O2a, and O4 and denied the inventive step of the subject matter of the claims based on both document O1 and document O2a as the closest prior art.

IV. With the response to the appeal, the respondents (patent proprietors) submitted nine auxiliary requests.

Claims 1 and 7 of auxiliary request 1 differed from the granted claims 1 and 8 by the inclusion of the feature: ""that the active ingredient(s) has/have a low tendency to spontaneous crystallization.""

Claims 1 and 6 of auxiliary request 2 differed from the granted claims 1 and 8 by the inclusion of the feature: ""that the active ingredient(s) is/are selected from the group consisting of anhydrous estradiol as well as buprenorphine, rotigotine, rivastigmine, scopolamine, granisetron, lerisetron, ramosetron, ondansetron, and pramipexole and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the aforementioned active ingredients.""

Claims 1 and 7 of auxiliary request 3 differed from the granted claims 1 and 8 by the inclusion of the feature: ""that the average particle size of the particles of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone is 5-500 μm.""

According to auxiliary request 4, the granted product claims 1-7 and 13 were deleted.

According to auxiliary request 5, the following feature was added to the granted process claim 8: ""and that the temperature treatment takes place during the production of the active ingredient-containing adhesive mass and/or the coating of the film- or foil-like polymer carrier.""

Auxiliary requests 6-9 corresponded to auxiliary requests 1-4 with the additional amendment of the process claims according to auxiliary request 5.

V. With the summons dated September 15, 2020, the Board invited the parties to an oral hearing.

In its preliminary opinion pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA dated December 16, 2020, the Board assumed the novelty of the subject matter of the patent claims but expressed its concerns regarding the inventive step in view of document O1 or O2a as the closest prior art.

VI. With the submission dated June 28, 2021, the respondents submitted further auxiliary requests.

The claims of auxiliary request 10 differed from the granted claims by the inclusion of the feature: ""wherein the active ingredient concentration is such that the matrix layer(s) is/are supersaturated with respect to the stable modification of the active ingredient(s)"" in claim 1 and the inclusion of the feature: ""and the active ingredient concentration is such that the adhesive mass is supersaturated with respect to the stable modification of the active ingredient(s)"" in claim 8.

Auxiliary requests 11-13 corresponded to auxiliary requests 4, 5, and 9, in which the amendments according to auxiliary request 10 were additionally incorporated.

VII. The oral hearing took place on July 23, 2021, in the form of a video conference. At the end of the hearing, the Board's decision was announced.

VIII. The relevant arguments of the appellant for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) Document O1 describes the production of TTS, whose matrix layer is produced using a solvent-based method or a melt method, and mentions crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone in a list of nine potentially usable adhesive enhancers.

Document O2a describes TTS, whose matrix layer can be produced, inter alia, using a solvent-based method or a melt method using polymeric microparticles. Crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone is one of the four exemplarily mentioned polymers and is used, for example, in solvent-based methods.

In the patent's definition of the combination of the hot melt adhesive with the crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, it does not represent a new selection compared to the teachings of documents O1 and O2a, similar to the case in decision T 783/09. The claimed TTS does not differ from the TTS produced using crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone exemplarily in document O2a, as the patent-defined hot melt adhesive can also be used in solvent-based methods.

Furthermore, example 1 of document O4 describes the production of a TTS using a melt method, in which olanzapine and crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone are processed in an adhesive. Even if the melting point of olanzapine is not reached during this process, the patent-defined temperature treatment for the claimed TTS does not result in a distinguishing feature.

Therefore, the subject matter of claim 1 of the granted patent is not novel with respect to the teachings of documents O1, O2a, and O4.

b) Should the Board conclude that the subject matter of claim 1 of the granted patent is novel, document O1 would serve as a starting point in the prior art. The subject matter of the patent claim represents at most a selection compared to the teaching of document O1 and differs from example 16 of this document only by the use of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone instead of colloidal silicon dioxide. Since no effect is demonstrated for the claimed subject matter compared to this prior art, the problem can only be seen as providing an alternative. Since document O1 already points to the possible use of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone instead of colloidal silicon dioxide, the subject matter of the patent claim is an obvious solution for the skilled person.

c) The definition of the active ingredient according to auxiliary requests 1 and 2 does not represent an additional distinguishing feature compared to the teaching of document O1. The average particle size of the crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone defined according to auxiliary request 3 results as an obvious embodiment in view of the micronized form of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone used according to document O4. The limitations on the process claims in auxiliary request 4, or the further adjustment of the process claims according to auxiliary requests 5-9 would also not result in any further distinction from the prior art.

d) Auxiliary requests 10-13 were submitted late and should not be admitted into the appeal proceedings according to Article 13(2) RPBA 2020.

IX. The relevant arguments of the respondents for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) The subject matter of the patent claim represents a new multiple selection compared to the teachings of documents O1 and O2a. The subject matter of the claim differs from the examples of document O2a, in which crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone is used, by the use of the hot melt adhesive.

Example 1 of document O4 does not describe the claimed temperature treatment. It cannot be assumed that this temperature treatment does not result in structural differences.

b) Document O1 allows for the application of a hot melt adhesive to dissolve or melt the active ingredient due to temperature (see paragraph [0039]) and describes crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone merely as one of several adhesive enhancers. To counteract recrystallization based on existing crystal nuclei of the active ingredient or other solids, document O1 describes the use of suitable protective and backing layers or a subsequent temperature treatment on the finished punched plaster (see paragraphs [0102] and [0104]). Example 16 of document O1 refers to the production of a matrix layer using a melt method. The processing temperature applied remains unclear, as the described extrusion temperature (1100°C) would suggest the pyrolysis of the organic compounds. Furthermore, the results in Table 5 and paragraph [0133] indicate that the matrix layer produced according to example 16 of document O1 is prone to recrystallization.

The subject matter of the patent claim differs from the known TTS from document O1 by the selection of the hot melt adhesive and the crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone as well as the internal structure resulting from the temperature treatment step. The crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, which does not melt during the temperature treatment and forms micro-reservoirs (see paragraph [0046] of the patent), effectively prevents the recrystallization of the active ingredient in conjunction with the temperature treatment and promotes the associated storage stability (see paragraph [0062] of the patent) independently of the measures described in document O1. The problem can thus be seen in the simplified and thus improved provision of a storage-stable TTS. There is no indication in the prior art of the claimed solution.

Moreover, the subject matter of the claim is also not obvious as a solution to the problem of providing an alternative TTS. It is not an arbitrarily composed combination of features, but a targeted selection to provide a functioning medicinal product. Document O1 proposes a variety of systems and methods, but lacks the necessary indication on the basis of which the skilled person would arrive at the subject matter of the claim.

c) The subject matter claimed according to auxiliary requests 1-3 differs additionally from the prior art by the definition of the active ingredient or the particle size of the crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone. Auxiliary request 4 restricts the subject matter of the claim to a process that is clearly characterized by the temperature treatment step. The adjustment of the process claims according to auxiliary requests 5-9 addresses concerns that the implementation of the temperature treatment in the granted process claims is to be interpreted more broadly than in the granted claim 1.

d) Auxiliary requests 10-13 contradict the preliminary opinion of the Board that document O2a might also be considered as the closest prior art.

X. The appellant requested that the contested decision be overturned and the patent be revoked in its entirety. Furthermore, she requested that auxiliary requests 10-13 not be admitted into the proceedings.

The respondents requested the dismissal of the appeal (main request). Alternatively, they requested the maintenance of the patent based on one of the auxiliary requests 1-9 submitted with the response to the appeal or based on one of the auxiliary requests 10-13 submitted with the letter dated June 28, 2021.","Reasons for the Decision

2. Main Request

2.1 Novelty

2.1.1 Document O1 and Document O2a

Document O1 describes the production of transdermal therapeutic systems (TTS) in which the active ingredient is present with additional additives, such as adhesion promoters, in an adhesive layer (see paragraphs [0011], [0016]). Crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone is mentioned in a list of possible adhesion promoters (see paragraphs [0016] and [0082]). The TTS can be produced by solvent-based methods (see paragraphs [0034] and [0097]) or melt methods (see paragraphs [0039] and [0099]). Undesired crystallization of the active ingredient can be counteracted, among other things, by heating the finished TTS to a temperature 20°C above the melting point of the active ingredient (see paragraph [0104], compare also paragraph [0044]). In the example referring to production by a melt method, no crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone is used (see Example 16, paragraphs [0126] to [0128]).

Document O2a describes the production of TTS with an active ingredient-containing adhesive layer. Polymer particles that are impregnated with the active ingredient in amorphous form (see paragraph [0035]) are dispersed in the adhesive of the adhesive layer (see paragraphs [0010] and [0011] and claim 1). Crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone is mentioned in a list of suitable polymer particles and is also used as an example (see paragraphs [0032], [0053], and [0055]). The possible use of a hot melt process is mentioned, but a solvent-based process is preferably and exemplarily employed (see paragraph [0040]).

According to the patent, a melt adhesive in combination with crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone is used in the claimed TTS and in the claimed method for producing the TTS. Therefore, based on the teachings of Document O1 and Document O2a, a multiple selection is required regarding, on the one hand, the type of adhesive corresponding to the choice of manufacturing method and, on the other hand, the additive used, in order to arrive at the subject matter of the patent claim. In view of this multiple selection, the Board considers that the claimed subject matter cannot be directly and unambiguously derived from Documents O1 and O2a.

The Board does not consider the decision T 783/09 cited by the appellant to be relevant in this context. In the case of decision T 783/09 (see sections 5.4-5.7), it involved the disclosure of two particularly preferred DPP-IV inhibitors that were to be combined with each of the other active ingredients from a list of 22 anti-diabetic compounds. From this, the 44 individual combinations were directly and unambiguously apparent to the skilled person as preferred. In contrast, Documents O1 and O2a do not describe the application of the hot melt process as preferred and further leave the skilled person with the choice of possible additives. Thus, the claimed subject matter corresponds more to a classical multiple selection, which, in accordance with the established case law of the Boards of Appeal of the EPO, is suitable for establishing novelty (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, ninth edition, I.C.6.2.1).

The further argument of the appellant that the claimed melt adhesive can also be used in a solvent-based process and is therefore not suitable for distinguishing over Document O2a is also not convincing. As can be seen from Document O3 (paragraphs [0050] to [0053]), specific additives are used for melt adhesives. Furthermore, it is also acknowledged in the statement of grounds of appeal that a hot melt process is associated with the use of a melt adhesive (see page 6, section 2.1.7).

2.1.2 Document O4

Document O4 deals with the production of TTS, avoiding the influence of solvent and temperature on the active ingredient (see page 3, lines 8-10). For this purpose, a polymer adhesive is mixed with a filler material, and the active ingredient is added to the heated mixture (see page 10, lines 13-15 and page 12, lines 3-5). Crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone is mentioned as a possible filler material, which is also used as an example (see page 11, lines 26-31). According to Example 1, adhesive and crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone are mixed at 70-80°C, olanzapine is added, the mixture is heated to 90-130°C, and then applied between a backing layer and a protective layer (see page 20, line 20 to page 21, line 6).

The melting point of olanzapine is known to be 195°C (see Document O12), and it is undisputed that Document O4 does not describe the claimed temperature treatment above this melting point. In this context, the Board points out that according to Document O1, a heat treatment above the melting point of the active ingredient is suitable for dissolving existing crystallization nuclei in an adhesive matrix (see paragraph [0104]). In the Board's view, a structural change of the TTS described in Document O4 is to be assumed when this TTS is subjected to the claimed temperature treatment.

Thus, the claimed subject matter is not pre-described in Document O4.

2.1.3 The granted subject matter therefore meets the requirement of novelty.

2.2 Inventive Step

2.2.1 Document O1 extensively discusses the application of a melt adhesive in a melt process, in which the active ingredient is dissolved or uniformly dispersed in the adhesive matrix at elevated temperature (see paragraphs [0039] and [0099]). Document O1 illustrates in Example 16 the process in which the active ingredient is melted and dispersed in the melt (see paragraphs [0126] to [0128]). The doubts of the opponents regarding the processing temperature in Example 16 due to the described extrusion temperature of 1100°C can be set aside, as paragraph [0127] explicitly refers to a hot melt process. In the Board's view, Document O1 thus describes a temperature treatment of the melt adhesive-based matrix layer that corresponds to the claimed temperature treatment. The difference of the claimed subject matter compared to the method described in Example 16 of Document O1 only concerns the use of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone instead of the colloidal silicon dioxide used in Example 16.

2.2.2 It is therefore to be assessed which problem can be considered solved by the use of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone in connection with the used melt adhesive and the defined temperature treatment, and whether, in light of the prior art, the claimed subject matter was obvious to the skilled person.

2.2.3 The opponents referred to the special suitability of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, as indicated in the patent, to function as a micro-reservoir and to avoid recrystallization of the active ingredient in connection with the defined temperature treatment. In contrast, Document O1 (see Table 5 and paragraph [0133]) shows the crystallization susceptibility of the TTS produced according to Example 16. However, the Board notes that the patent does not provide evidence of an advantage associated with the claimed subject matter over the method known from Document O1, for example in the form of experimental data, and such evidence has not been submitted by the opponents. In this context, it should be noted that according to Example 16 of Document O1, the matrix layer produced and microscopically examined between smooth cover layers remained free of crystals (see Document O1 paragraph [0128]). The opponents also did not demonstrate that the crystallization mentioned in Document O1 could be avoided by the claimed application of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone when using crystallization-promoting cover layers (see Table 5 and paragraph [0133]). The Board therefore sees no basis for the assumption that the claimed use of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone offers an advantage over the method known from Document O1.

The problem solved by the claimed subject matter is therefore seen in providing an alternative TTS.

2.2.4 As a solution to this problem, the skilled person would consider the use of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone to be obvious, as Document O1 already explicitly points to the possible use of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone in the production of TTS with active ingredient-containing matrix layers (see paragraphs [0016] and [0082]), and the possible use of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone in matrix layers of TTS was also sufficiently known to the skilled person from Documents O2a and O4. In this context, the Board considers it irrelevant whether the prior art suggests a variety of embodiments and does not particularly highlight the use of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, as the solved problem is merely seen in providing an alternative (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, ninth edition, I.D.9.19.10).

2.2.5 The subject matter of granted claim 1 therefore does not meet the requirement of inventive step.

3. Auxiliary Requests 1-9

3.1 The definition in claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 that the active ingredient has a low tendency for spontaneous crystallization does not, in the Board's view, include any further difference from the prior art on which an inventive step could be based, as this vague definition also applies to the active ingredients described in Document O1.

3.2 Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 defines specific active ingredients contained in the TTS. The opponents did not assert any unexpected effect associated with the use of the specifically defined active ingredients. Therefore, this auxiliary request merely represents further alternatives to the prior art. In light of the description of possible active ingredients in Document O1, in which scopolamine defined in claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 is also mentioned (see Document O1 paragraph [0066]), the reasons explained in sections 2.2.1-2.2.5 regarding the main request apply equally to auxiliary request 2.

3.3 Due to the lack of indications of a special effect, the defined average particle size of the crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone according to auxiliary request 3 is also merely an alternative to the prior art. In light of the already described use of the micronized form of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone in a melt process in Document O4, the Board considers that the feature of particle size does not contribute to an inventive step.

3.4 The considerations mentioned above in sections 2.2.1-2.2.5 regarding the main request apply equally to the method according to auxiliary request 4.

3.5 The claims of auxiliary requests 5-9 correspond to the claims of the granted patent, or to the claims of auxiliary requests 1-4, in which the feature of temperature treatment during the production of the adhesive mass or the coating of the carrier has been included in the process claims. Since this does not constitute an additionally distinguishing feature over the teaching of Document O1, the Board also considers that this feature does not contribute to an inventive step.

3.6 The subject matter defined in auxiliary requests 1-9 therefore does not meet the requirement of inventive step.

4. Auxiliary Requests 10-13

Auxiliary requests 10-13 were submitted by the opponents only after the summons to the oral proceedings was issued.

According to Article 13(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA) 2020, amendments to the appeal case of a party after the summons to the oral proceedings are generally not taken into account unless the party concerned has shown compelling reasons that extraordinary circumstances exist.

According to the opponents, auxiliary requests 10-13 were in response to the preliminary opinion of the Board that Document O2a might also be considered as the closest prior art. However, the Board notes that the appellant referred to Document O2 as the closest prior art in the statement of grounds of appeal. The Board therefore does not consider the justification of the opponents for the late submission of auxiliary requests 10-13 to be compelling and has not admitted these auxiliary requests into the appeal proceedings.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1.

I. European Patent No. 2 498 762 (hereinafter: the Patent) was granted with nine claims.

The subject matter of the granted patent related to a method for preventing the crystallization of the active ingredient Rotigotine in a polymer film, wherein a spread solvent-containing coating composition, in which Rotigotine is dispersed in the form of a solid solution in a matrix-forming polymer, is dried at temperatures that do not exceed 15 minutes at 10 to 25 °C above the melting temperature of the contained Rotigotine.

II. Three oppositions were filed against the grant of the patent. The grounds for opposition were lack of novelty and lack of inventive step, insufficient disclosure, and impermissible extension under the EPC.

The appeals of Opponent 01 (Appellant 01), the then Opponent 02, and Opponent 03 (Appellant 03) were directed against the interim decision of the Opposition Division that the patent, taking into account the amendments submitted with the main request of September 3, 2018, met the requirements of the EPC.

Claim 1 of this main request read:

""Method for preventing the crystallization of the active ingredient Rotigotine in a polymer film, characterized in that the spread solvent-containing coating composition, comprising a matrix-forming polymer or polymer mixture and Rotigotine as the active ingredient, which is dispersed in the form of a solid solution in the matrix-forming polymer, is dried for at least 100 seconds and not longer than 10 minutes at a temperature 10 to 25 °C above the melting point of the active ingredient contained in the coating composition.""

In the opposition proceedings, the following evidence was submitted, among others:

D3: WO 2004/058247A1

The Opposition Division reached the following conclusions:

a) The subject matter claimed in the main request did not extend beyond the content of the originally filed application.

b) There was no evidence that the claimed method was not executable.

c) The subject matter of the main request was novel.

d) The closest prior art was document D3. The difference of the subject matter from D3 concerned the definition of the drying time and temperature as well as the definition of the active ingredient in the form of a solid solution.

The objective was seen in preventing the crystallization of Rotigotine from a polymer matrix that contains Rotigotine as a solid solution and shows good active ingredient release. No document in the prior art indicated stabilization through the defined drying in connection with the presence of a solid solution of Rotigotine.

Thus, the subject matter of the main request involved an inventive step.

III. With her response to the appeal, the Respondent (patent holder) submitted the same set of claims as the main request that was also the basis for the contested decision.

IV. The Board summoned the parties to an oral hearing with the summons dated May 7, 2021.

In its communication pursuant to Article 15 (1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal 2020, the Board questioned whether the method in which the solid solution of Rotigotine is already present in the spread and to be dried coating composition at elevated temperature is directly and unambiguously derivable for the skilled person from the original application.

V. In a letter dated May 27, 2021, Opponent 02 withdrew its opposition.

Appellant 01 announced in its submission dated December 6, 2021, that it would not participate in the oral hearing.

VI. The oral hearing was held on January 14, 2022, as a video conference.

VII. The relevant arguments of the Appellants for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

The claimed defined drying of the solvent-containing coating composition, in which Rotigotine is dispersed as a solid solution in the matrix-forming polymer, goes beyond the content of the originally filed application.

Although the original description mentions that in a preferred embodiment the active ingredient is dispersed in the form of a solid solution in the matrix-forming polymer, this refers to the resulting dried product and not to the solvent-containing coating composition yet to be dried. This is evident from the original description, which states that the coating composition is spread as a solution or suspension onto a substrate. Only through the removal of the solvent during drying does the preferred solid solution form, in which, according to the definition of the solid solution in the original description, Rotigotine is present in the form of a molecularly dispersed distribution. Accordingly, the examples of the originally filed application also refer to the coating composition to be spread and dried as a dispersion.

VIII. The relevant arguments of the Respondent can be summarized as follows:

The originally filed application explicitly states that the active ingredient is preferably dispersed in the form of a solid solution in the matrix-forming polymer. There is no indication in the originally filed application that the preferred embodiment regarding the solid solution pertains only to the final dried product.

In this context, the definition of the solid solution in the original description is decisive, according to which it is a molecularly dispersed distribution of the active ingredient in the matrix polymer. Such a distribution already exists in the coating composition in the reservoir, as even at this stage the polymer surrounds the dissolved Rotigotine molecules on all sides. Moreover, the described common solvents would already evaporate during the pouring of the coating composition, so that in the spread coating composition the Rotigotine molecules are inevitably surrounded not by solvent molecules but by remaining polymer molecules.

Thus, the claimed defined drying of the solvent-containing coating composition, in which Rotigotine is dispersed as a solid solution in the matrix-forming polymer, does not go beyond the content of the originally filed application.

IX. Appellants 01 and 03 requested that the contested decision be overturned and the patent be revoked in its entirety.

X. The Respondent requested that the appeals be dismissed and the patent be maintained with the claims attached to the response to the appeal, which also formed the basis of the decision.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The originally filed application describes a method for preventing the crystallization of a pharmaceutical substance in a polymer film, in which a spread solvent-containing coating composition, comprising a matrix-forming polymer or polymer mixture as well as the pharmaceutical substance, is dried at temperatures that are temporarily at least 10°C above the melting temperature of the pharmaceutical substance (see page 5, lines 19-24 and page 5, line 30 to page 6, line 6; see also claim 1).

The originally filed application mentions preferred time spans (see claims 4 and 5) and a preferred temperature range (see page 6, lines 8-11) for the defined temporary drying at temperatures of at least 10°C above the melting temperature of the pharmaceutical substance. Furthermore, Rotigotine along with Fentanyl is mentioned as a particularly preferred active ingredient (see page 8, lines 4-6) and is also used exemplarily.

According to the originally filed application, the pharmaceutical substance-containing polymer films are usually produced by adding at least one pharmaceutical substance and optionally further excipients to a solution or suspension of the matrix-forming polymer or polymer mixture. The resulting coating composition is spread onto a film-like substrate to form a coating of defined thickness, and the coated substrate is then passed through a drying channel, in which the solvent or solvent mixture is removed at elevated temperature, so that only small residual amounts of solvent, a maximum of 0.5 wt.%, remain in the coating (see page 6, line 30 to page 7, line 6).

Examples 1 and 2 of the originally filed application (see page 8, lines 8-29 and page 9, lines 10-26) refer to a two-phase coating composition consisting of a dispersion, in which a polysiloxane adhesive is present in n-heptane in the outer phase and Rotigotine and polyvinylpyrrolidone are present dissolved in ethanol in the inner phase. The drying of the coating in a drying channel with the following temperature profiles is described:

in Example 1 for comparison:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

and in Example 2 for the invention:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

The originally filed application describes a preferred embodiment as follows:

""In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical substance is dispersed in the form of a solid solution in the matrix-forming polymer. A 'solid solution' is understood to mean a molecularly dispersed distribution of the pharmaceutical substance in the matrix polymer."" (see page 7, lines 8-12).

2. Claim 1 of the present application of the respondent relates to a method for preventing the crystallization of the pharmaceutical substance Rotigotine in a polymer film, in which a spread solvent-containing coating composition, in which Rotigotine is dispersed as a pharmaceutical substance in the form of a solid solution in a matrix-forming polymer, is dried under specific defined conditions. In addition to the definition of the pharmaceutical substance Rotigotine and the specific drying conditions, the present claim 1 differs from the originally filed claim 1 by the definition of the solid solution of Rotigotine in the solvent-containing coating composition to be dried.

The only passage of the originally filed application that describes the pharmaceutical substance in the form of a solid solution in the matrix-forming polymer relates to the cited section on page 7, lines 8-12.

Although this section explicitly describes a preferred embodiment in which the pharmaceutical substance is present in the form of a solid solution, this section does not explicitly refer to the coating composition that is yet to be dried.

For the assessment of the present claim 1 regarding the requirement of Article 123(2) EPC, the question arises whether the claimed method can still be derived directly and unambiguously from the original application, in which the solid solution of Rotigotine in the matrix-forming polymer is already present in the spread and to be dried coating composition at elevated temperature.

3. The respondent has argued that the described coating composition already corresponds to the definition of a solid solution according to the original application before it is spread, because the polymer already surrounds the dissolved Rotigotine molecules in all directions in the coating composition in the reservoir.

However, the Board notes that the originally filed application defines the solid solution as a molecularly dispersed distribution of the pharmaceutical substance in the matrix polymer. This definition corresponds to the common understanding of a solid solution, in which one or more solids, such as a pharmaceutical substance, are dissolved in one or more other solids, such as a matrix-forming polymer. The respondent's view that the definition of the solid solution according to the original application also includes the coating composition that is still to be spread and thus still liquid is considered by the Board to be contradictory and therefore misguided.

4. The respondent has also argued that the common solvents described in the original application evaporate already when pouring out the coating composition, and accordingly, the Rotigotine molecules in the spread coating composition are necessarily no longer surrounded by solvent molecules, but by remaining polymer molecules, and thus are present in solid solution.

However, the Board points out that according to the originally filed application, the drying of the solvent-containing spread coating composition is usually carried out in a drying channel, where the solvent or solvent mixture is removed at elevated temperature, so that only small residual amounts of solvent remain in the coating (see the passage mentioned above in section 1 on page 6, line 30 to page 7, line 6). Accordingly, a two-phase coating composition is spread according to the examples, and the drying is subsequently carried out in a drying channel. In this context, one must assume a solidification of the coating composition associated with the solvent removal due to drying. However, it cannot be derived from the originally filed application that a solid solution of Rotigotine in the polymer necessarily results from the evaporation of the solvent already when spreading the coating and before the described removal of the solvent during drying at elevated temperature.

The method claimed in the present claim 1, in which the solid solution of Rotigotine in the matrix-forming polymer is already present in the spread and to be dried coating composition at elevated temperature, thus does not emerge directly and unambiguously from the originally filed application.

5. The Board therefore concludes that claim 1 of the present application of the respondent does not meet the requirement of Article 123(2) EPC and that the patent is to be revoked.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1.

I. European Patent No. 1 802 302 (hereinafter: the Patent) was granted with six claims.

Claim 1 of the granted patent read:

""Oxymetazoline and/or Xylometazoline for use in antiviral prophylaxis and/or antiviral treatment of viral diseases selected from the group consisting of acute rhinitis, influenza, parainfluenza, otitis media, and sinusitis, wherein oxymetazoline and/or xylometazoline are antiviral effective.""

II. An opposition was filed against the grant of the patent. The Opponent requested the revocation of the patent in its entirety due to lack of novelty and inventive step, insufficient disclosure, and impermissible extension.

The appeal of the patent holder and the appeal of the opponent are directed against the interim decision of the opposition division that the patent, taking into account the amendments according to the auxiliary request 3 submitted during the opposition proceedings, meets the requirements of the Convention. The decision referred to the patent in the granted version (main request), the auxiliary requests 1 and 2 submitted with the letter dated November 9, 2018, as well as the auxiliary request 3 submitted during the oral proceedings on January 10, 2019.

In the contested decision, the opposition division reached the following conclusions:

a) Claim 1 of the granted patent does not go beyond the content of the originally filed application and does not represent a new combination of features in particular.

In view of the general knowledge and the lack of antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline against adenoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, and RSV according to document D23, it is not plausible that the effect characterizing the subject matter of claim 1 can be achieved across the entire claimed scope. Thus, the subject matter of claim 1 is not sufficiently disclosed.

b) The additional definition in claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 that the active ingredients are antiviral effective against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses represents an assignment of the defined diseases to these viruses, which cannot be derived from the original application.

Auxiliary request 1 therefore does not meet the requirement of Article 123(2) EPC.

The same objection applies to claim 1 of auxiliary request 2, in which the viral diseases have additionally been restricted to acute rhinitis (common cold) and/or influenza.

c) Claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 defines the antiviral efficacy against rhinoviruses and restricts the diseases to acute rhinitis.

Auxiliary request 3 meets the requirements of Articles 123(2), 84, and 83 EPC.

Document D6 does not represent prior art because the priority has been effectively claimed.

The subject matter of the claim targets the antiviral effect and thus refers to a new clinical situation compared to the known symptomatic treatment. None of the documents D1, D3, D5, D8, D9, D19, D20, D25, D29, D37, D39, D41, D44, D45, and D48 describe the use of oxymetazoline or xylometazoline as an antiviral agent in the treatment of acute rhinitis. Thus, auxiliary request 3 fulfills the requirement of novelty.

Documents D1, D8, and D37 are considered the closest prior art. However, the skilled person would not arrive at the subject matter of the claim in an obvious manner, as none of the prior art indicates efficacy against rhinoviruses. Thus, auxiliary request 3 also meets the requirement of inventive step.

III. In the statement of grounds of appeal, the patent holder initially maintained its main request from the first instance proceedings to reject the opposition and requested, alternatively, to maintain the patent with the amendments according to the auxiliary requests 1-6 submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal. The main request and auxiliary request 1 were withdrawn during the appeal proceedings. The auxiliary request 2 submitted in the appeal proceedings corresponds to the auxiliary request 2 underlying the contested decision.

Claim 1 of this auxiliary request 2 reads:

""Oxymetazoline and/or xylometazoline for use in antiviral prophylaxis and/or antiviral treatment of viral diseases selected from acute rhinitis, and/or influenza, wherein oxymetazoline and/or xylometazoline are antiviral effective against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses.""

IV. In the written proceedings, the opponent objected to the admission of auxiliary request 2 and maintained its objections that this request does not meet the requirements of Articles 123(2), 123(3), 83, 84, 54, and 56 EPC. In the submission of June 29, 2020, the opponent referred to the ineffectiveness of known therapies against COVID-19 diseases to illustrate the objection of insufficient disclosure regarding antiviral efficacy.

V. In its communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the Board communicated, among other things, its preliminary assessment that auxiliary request 2 is part of the appeal proceedings, that the priority for this request is effectively claimed, and that this request meets the requirements of Articles 123(2), 123(3), 83, 84, 54, and 56 EPC.

VI. The oral proceedings took place on December 11, 2023.

During the proceedings, the opponent additionally objected to the present auxiliary request 2 under Rule 80 EPC and also requested to refer a question to the Enlarged Board of Appeal regarding the use of subsequently accessible experimental data to substantiate the requirements of Article 83 EPC.

VII. The relevant arguments of the patent holder for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) Admission of auxiliary request 2

Auxiliary request 2 was admitted according to the contested decision. The opponent has not substantiated any erroneous exercise of discretion by the opposition division in this regard.

b) Rule 80 EPC

The objection based on Rule 80 EPC was impermissibly raised only during the oral proceedings before the Board. Furthermore, the objection is unfounded because the change in the definition of the diseases to be treated was prompted by the opposition ground of lack of sufficiency of disclosure and corresponds literally to the preferred embodiment described in the original description.

c) Article 84 EPC

The use defined in claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 for antiviral prophylaxis or treatment clearly refers only to those viral diseases that are attributable to rhinoviruses or influenza viruses.

d) Article 123(2) EPC

The antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline in the treatment of acute rhinitis and influenza defined in claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 corresponds to the originally described causal antiviral treatment of these diseases.

The restriction of the active ingredients to oxymetazoline and xylometazoline as well as the restriction of the viral diseases to acute rhinitis and influenza correspond to the originally described preferred embodiments. The efficacy defined in the claim against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses traces back to the originally described list of diseases caused by viruses and also concerns a preferred embodiment highlighted in the original application by examples.

The claim definition of the active ingredients for antiviral use can validly trace back to the originally disclosed use of the active ingredients for the preparation of an antiviral drug.

e) Article 123(3) EPC

The granted claim 1 is not exclusively related to the treatment of individual viral diseases. Therefore, the use of the conjunction ""and/or"" in the definition of the diseases according to claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 does not result in an extension compared to the granted subject matter.

f) Article 83 EPC and request for referral to the Enlarged Board of Appeal

The suitability of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline for the claimed antiviral use against acute rhinitis and influenza has been sufficiently disclosed in the patent based on the experimentally demonstrated in vitro efficacy of oxymetazoline against rhinoviruses HRV-14 and HRV-2 as well as influenza A viruses.

The objections regarding the relevance of in vitro tests, the generalization of efficacy to rhinoviruses and influenza viruses, the lack of information on suitable dosage forms and dosages, the possibility of antiviral prophylaxis, and the generalization of the efficacy of oxymetazoline to xylometazoline have not been substantiated. The merely symptomatic efficacy of xylometazoline according to document D10 does not raise serious doubts about the antiviral efficacy of xylometazoline as described in the patent. This information in document D10 is also not accurate in light of the results in document D50, which has already been validly submitted with the opposition reply. The late submission regarding the ineffectiveness of known antiviral therapies against COVID-19 diseases is irrelevant. There is no reason to refer the question to the Enlarged Board of Appeal regarding subsequently submitted experimental results to substantiate sufficiency of disclosure.

g) Priority

The arguments regarding the requirements of Article 123(2) also apply to the support of the subject matter in the priority document.

h) Novelty

The antiviral use defined in claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 with efficacy against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses corresponds, similar to the case of decision T 1955/09, to a new clinical situation that establishes the novelty of the claimed subject matter compared to the known symptomatic efficacy of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline in the treatment of corresponding cold diseases from documents D3, D5, D8, D9, D19, D20, D25, D29, D31, D37, D39, D41, D44, D45, and D48.

i) Inventive step

The distinguishing antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline has been sufficiently demonstrated and should therefore be included as an effective difference from the prior art when formulating the objective technical problem. This also applies to documents D8 and D37, which only describe the combination with other remedies, including antiviral agents, but do not describe the independent antiviral application of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline.

Starting from document D8 or D37 as the closest prior art, the objective technical problem is to provide a new approach to the treatment of the defined diseases.

The efficacy defined in the claim as antiviral for oxymetazoline and xylometazoline has not been suggested to the skilled person as a solution to this problem by the content of documents D8 and D37 or the other cited prior art.

Document D37 even leads away from the claimed invention, as this document contains a detailed list of antiviral active substances, but lacks any indication of the antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline.

The inhibition of HSV reactivation described in document D1 relates to a fundamentally different efficacy, from which no corresponding expectation regarding the use defined in claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses arises. Therefore, document D1 does not represent a suitable starting point in the prior art for the skilled person to arrive at the subject matter of auxiliary request 2 in an obvious manner.

VIII. The relevant arguments of the opponent for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) Admission of auxiliary request 2

Auxiliary request 2 was submitted late during the opposition proceedings. The opponent has been unduly disadvantaged by the admission of this auxiliary request.

b) Rule 80 EPC

In claim 1 of auxiliary request 2, the formulation ""diseases selected from acute rhinitis, and/or influenza"" does not justify the use of the conjunction ""and/or"" based on an opposition ground.

c) Article 84 EPC

The connection of the specific virus types defined in claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 with the prophylaxis or treatment of the claimed viral diseases is unclear.

d) Article 123(2) EPC

The original application describes antiviral treatment as causal. The omission of this qualification in claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 constitutes an impermissible extension.

The combination of the definition of antiviral efficacy against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses with the amended definition of viral diseases and the restriction of the active ingredients in claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 does not directly and unambiguously emerge from the original application.

The definition of the active ingredients for antiviral use also impermissibly goes beyond the originally described use for the preparation of a medicinal product.

e) Article 123(3) EPC

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 encompasses, due to the conjunction ""and/or"" used in the definition of the diseases, also the simultaneous treatment of acute rhinitis and influenza and therefore leads to an impermissible extension of the scope of protection compared to the granted patent.

f) Article 83 EPC and request for referral to the Enlarged Board of Appeal

The experimental results reported in the patent regarding antiviral efficacy are not indicative of the implied therapeutic success of treatment as claimed, as these results only concern in vitro efficacy.

These details regarding in vitro efficacy also only concern certain subtypes of viruses, namely rhinoviruses HRV-14 / HRV-2 and influenza A. The generalization to rhinoviruses and influenza viruses is not scientifically justifiable. This is also illustrated by the ineffectiveness of known therapies against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 diseases.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 lacks the necessary indication of suitable dosage forms and dosages.

The defined antiviral prophylaxis is not comprehensible, and it remains open how the viral pathogens, especially in the case of prophylaxis, are to be determined.

Moreover, the experimental results in the patent only concern the efficacy of oxymetazoline, which, unlike xylometazoline, has a phenolic OH group. In light of this significant structural difference, the efficacy of xylometazoline does not credibly emerge from the patent. Furthermore, document D10 raises serious doubts about the efficacy of xylometazoline. Subsequently submitted experimental results regarding the antiviral efficacy of xylometazoline, as contained in document D50, are generally unsuitable according to relevant case law to compensate for a lack of disclosure. Document D50 should therefore be excluded from the proceedings or not considered regarding the requirement of sufficient disclosure. Furthermore, document D50 only refers to the in vitro efficacy of xylometazoline. In the event of a differing assessment by the Board, the question of the relevance of subsequently published experimental results to substantiate sufficient disclosure should be referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal.

g) Priority

For the reasons stated regarding the requirements of Article 123(2), the subject matter is not entitled to priority even if it is identical to the original disclosure in the priority document. Document D6 should therefore be considered prior art.

h) Novelty

The active ingredients to be used according to claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 have already been used for the same treatment of the same cold diseases prior to the priority date according to documents D3, D5, D8, D9, D19, D20, D25, D29, D31, D37, D39, D41, D44, D45, and D48.

The defined antiviral prophylaxis or treatment and the antiviral efficacy against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses do not represent a distinction from the prior art in light of relevant case law, particularly T 233/96, T 836/01, T 254/93, and T 779/18, as the defined antiviral efficacy is not associated with the treatment of a new patient group or a new clinical situation and does not provide a reason for a changed treatment of patients in practice. The antiviral effect is at best a retrospective explanation of an effect that has always occurred.

i) Inventive step

Based on the cited prior art regarding novelty, particularly documents D8 and D37, or the known antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline in the treatment of an HSV infection from document D1, the subject matter does not involve an inventive step.

The antiviral efficacy defined in the claim has not been demonstrated for the entire claimed scope and therefore cannot substantiate an inventive step.

Moreover, the use defined in claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 also relates to the treatment of cold diseases, in which oxymetazoline or xylometazoline is administered in combination with additional active substances. However, the antiviral efficacy of compositions suitable for the treatment of corresponding diseases that contain additional antiviral active ingredients alongside oxymetazoline or xylometazoline was already known from documents D8 and D37. An effect attributable to the defined antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline or xylometazoline in such otherwise known treatments of cold diseases to substantiate an inventive step has not been demonstrated and is also not comprehensible.

Insofar as the defined antiviral efficacy represents an effective difference of the claimed subject matter from the prior art, revealing this efficacy lies within the routine skills of the skilled person, especially since an antiviral effect of alpha-sympathomimetics such as oxymetazoline against HSV was already known from document D1, and documents D8 and D37 already associated compositions containing oxymetazoline and xylometazoline with a corresponding antiviral effect. This effect is at best a bonus effect.

IX. The appealing patent holder requested to overturn the contested decision and maintain the patent according to auxiliary request 2 submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal.

Furthermore, the patent holder requested that the opponent's submissions regarding SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 according to the submission of June 29, 2020, as well as the objection under Rule 80 EPC, not be admitted into the appeal proceedings.

X. The appealing opponent requested to overturn the contested decision and revoke the patent in its entirety.

The opponent also requested that auxiliary request 2 submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal and document D50 not be admitted into the appeal proceedings.

The opponent further requested to refer the following question to the Enlarged Board of Appeal:

""Is it permissible, in the case of an invention protected by a purpose-limited product claim within the meaning of Article 54(4) or (5) EPC, where the use feature precisely establishes the distinction from the prior art (here: antiviral efficacy of xylometazoline against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses in the antiviral prophylaxis and/or treatment of acute rhinitis and/or influenza), to refer to subsequently publicly accessible experimental data that became available only after the filing or priority date to substantiate the requirements of Article 83 EPC?""","Reasons for the Decision

1. Admission of Auxiliary Request 2

Auxiliary Request 2 was submitted within the time limit set by the Opposition Division in accordance with Rule 116 EPC. The decision of the Opposition Division is based, among other things, on this request. Furthermore, the minutes of the oral proceedings held on January 10, 2019, do not indicate that the Opponent maintained an objection against the admission of Auxiliary Request 2 before the Opposition Division. Therefore, the Board considers Auxiliary Request 2 to be part of the appeal proceedings in accordance with Articles 12(1) and 12(2) RPBA 2020.

2. Admission of Document D50

Document D50 was already submitted by the Patent Proprietor with the reply to the opposition. The Board sees no valid legal reason for the Opponent's request to exclude this document from the appeal proceedings.

3. Rule 80 EPC (Auxiliary Request 2)

The amendment of the definition of the diseases to be treated by the wording ""diseases selected from acute rhinitis, and/or influenza"" in claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 2 is suitable to counter the ground for opposition of lack of enablement of the invention claimed in the granted patent regarding the treatment of parainfluenza. This amendment adopts the literal wording regarding the preferentially treatable diseases according to the granted patent (see paragraph [0013]).

The Board is therefore convinced that the relevant amendment is prompted by a ground for opposition and thus complies with Rule 80 EPC. In light of this result, a detailed assessment of the contested admission of the objection under Rule 80 EPC is unnecessary.

4. Article 84 EPC (Auxiliary Request 2)

Claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 2 explicitly refers to the use of oxymetazoline or xylometazoline for the antiviral prophylaxis or antiviral treatment of acute rhinitis and influenza, with these active substances being effective against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses. According to the Board, it is clear that claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 2 assumes that the relevant acute rhinitis and influenza are associated with rhinoviruses or influenza viruses.

The Board therefore believes that the clarity objection raised by the Opponent regarding the correlation of the definition of the virus types with the prophylaxis or treatment of the claimed viral diseases is unfounded.

5. Article 123(2) EPC (Auxiliary Request 2)

5.1 The antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline defined in claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 2 in the treatment of acute rhinitis and influenza is directed against the viral pathogens that cause the relevant diseases. It is understood that the claimed use of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline is directed towards the causal prophylaxis or treatment of the defined viral diseases, in accordance with the statements in the originally filed description (see page 1, 4th paragraph). The omission of the explicit designation of the defined prophylaxis or treatment as causal does not, in the Board's opinion, constitute an impermissible extension beyond the content of the originally filed application.

5.2 The originally filed application (see page 2, lines 6-7) describes the use of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline for the prophylaxis or treatment of viral diseases as particularly preferred. The originally filed application (see page 4, lines 7-8) also mentions the use for the prophylaxis or treatment of acute rhinitis and/or influenza as particularly preferred.

The specifically defined efficacy against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses in claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 2 can be derived from the list of, for example, treatable viral diseases in the original application (see page 2, lines 9-22) and is consistent with the efficacy against rhinoviruses HRV-14 and HRV-2 as well as influenza A viruses indicated in the experimental part of the patent. The connection of acute rhinitis and influenza with rhinoviruses and influenza is self-evident to the skilled person and is also evident from the aforementioned list of treatable viral diseases in the original application (see page 2, line 12 and lines 17-18).

Considering the selection of the active substances and viral diseases defined in claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 2, which was already highlighted as particularly preferred in the original application, the claimed antiviral efficacy against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses is thus merely a simple limitation that can be directly and unambiguously derived from the original application.

5.3 The original application (see page 1, 4th paragraph) explicitly describes the use of the active substances for the preparation of a medicinal product for the prophylaxis or treatment of antiviral diseases in connection with the finding of the antiviral efficacy of the described active substances. In the Board's opinion, the use defined in claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 2 for antiviral purposes does not provide the skilled person with new technical information.

5.4 Therefore, Auxiliary Request 2 does not go beyond the content of the originally filed application and thus meets the requirement of Article 123(2) EPC.

6. Article 123(3) EPC (Auxiliary Request 2)

The granted claim 1 defines the use for antiviral prophylaxis or antiviral treatment of viral diseases selected from the group consisting of acute rhinitis, influenza, parainfluenza, otitis media, and sinusitis. This definition of use does not exclude the simultaneous prophylaxis or treatment of individual diseases. Therefore, the definition of the diseases in claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 2 represents, even considering the conjunction ""and/or,"" merely a limitation compared to the granted subject matter.

Auxiliary Request 2 thus meets the requirement of Article 123(3) EPC.

7. Article 83 EPC (Auxiliary Request 2)

7.1 The patent presents results from in vitro experiments that demonstrate the efficacy of oxymetazoline against rhinoviruses HRV-14 and HRV-2 as well as influenza A viruses (see the patent, paragraphs [0026]-[0036]).

In the Board's opinion, the patent describes, based on these in vitro test results, the suitability of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline for the antiviral use against acute rhinitis and influenza caused by rhinoviruses or influenza viruses in a credible manner.

In light of this credible description of the claimed efficacy of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline, the Opponent has not raised any serious and substantiated doubts regarding the sufficient disclosure of the claimed invention.

7.2 The Opponent has questioned the significance of the in vitro test results in the patent for therapeutic success, but has not provided specific substantiated reasons why the demonstrated in vitro efficacy cannot also be realized in the claimed therapeutic prophylaxis or treatment.

7.3 The Opponent's objection that the generalization of the antiviral efficacy demonstrated against rhinoviruses HRV-14 and HRV-2 as well as influenza A viruses to the groups of rhinoviruses and influenza viruses is scientifically unjustifiable also lacks a specific substantiated justification. The Opponent has pointed out the ineffectiveness of known therapies for the treatment of infections with coronaviruses against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 diseases. However, the Opponent has not further specified which known therapies this reference pertains to. In the Board's opinion, it is not apparent that the ineffectiveness of unspecified known therapies against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 diseases raises serious doubts about the efficacy of the claimed active substances against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses as demonstrated in the patent based on the activity of oxymetazoline against rhinoviruses HRV-14 and HRV-2 as well as influenza A viruses. A detailed assessment of the contested admission of this argument is therefore unnecessary.

7.4 The Opponent's argument that the suitability of xylometazoline for the claimed use is not credibly derived from the antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline, because these active substances differ structurally significantly, and that document D10 raises serious doubts about the claimed efficacy of xylometazoline, is also not convincing to the Board.

As described in the patent (see paragraphs [0001]-[0002]), the active substances xylometazoline and oxymetazoline are known to belong to the group of alpha-sympathomimetics with a 2-imidazoline structure, which contribute to a reduction in mucus secretion and decongestion of the nasal mucosa when used locally against, for example, acute rhinitis. The structure of xylometazoline, apart from the absence of a phenolic OH group, corresponds to the structure of oxymetazoline. Thus, xylometazoline and oxymetazoline are functionally and structurally related active substances. The Opponent has not provided any specific substantiated reasons why the skilled person should seriously doubt the claimed antiviral efficacy of the two active substances against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses based on the activity of oxymetazoline against rhinoviruses HRV-14 and HRV-2 as well as influenza A viruses due to the absence of the phenolic OH group in xylometazoline at the time of the original application.

The subsequently published excerpt from Wikipedia in document D10 (see under ""acute rhinitis"") states that nasal sprays containing the active substance xylometazoline act only symptomatically against acute rhinitis, while sprays containing the active substance oxymetazoline exhibit a direct antiviral effect by preventing the expression of a receptor for human rhinovirus (ICAM-1). However, document D50 clearly shows that xylometazoline, like oxymetazoline, has antiviral efficacy against rhinoviruses. The unsubstantiated statement in document D10 regarding the merely symptomatic efficacy of xylometazoline thus proves to be incorrect and therefore does not raise serious doubts about the sufficient disclosure of the claimed invention in the patent. In this context, document D50 is not referenced to supplement the disclosure of the claimed invention in the patent, but only to counter the incorrect information from document D10.

7.5 The patent describes in paragraphs [0009]-[0024] in detail how the skilled person can administer the relevant active substances systemically or topically and indicates effective concentrations of the active substances in the examples (see paragraphs [0027]-[0035]). In light of these instructions, it is not apparent that providing suitable dosage forms and determining effective dosages would leave the skilled person with unreasonable tasks in realizing the claimed invention.

7.6 The patent also explains in paragraph [0009] that in the defined antiviral prophylaxis, the disease-causing viruses are fought immediately after infection, thus preventing the disease from occurring at all. In light of the demonstrated antiviral efficacy against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses, the patent thus also sufficiently describes how the claimed prophylaxis is to be realized.

7.7 The Board is therefore convinced that Auxiliary Request 2 meets the requirement of Article 83 EPC.

8. Priority (Auxiliary Request 2)

The finding in the contested decision that the originally filed application underlying the patent in dispute is word-for-word identical to the priority document DE 102004049008.2, apart from some added experimental results, was not contested in the appeal proceedings.

In light of this correspondence of the original application with the priority document, the Board believes that the effective claim to priority arises from the same considerations outlined in the above section 5 regarding the requirement of Article 123(2) EPC.

Document D6, which was published after the claimed priority, is therefore not considered prior art.

9. Novelty (Auxiliary Request 2)

9.1 The Opponent denied the novelty of the subject matter of Auxiliary Request 2 based on documents D3, D5, D8, D9, D19, D20, D25, D29, D31, D37, D39, D41, D44, D45, and D48. The Opponent did not dispute that the claimed antiviral effect of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline was not previously described in this prior art, but argued that according to this prior art, the defined active substances were already used before the priority date for the identical treatment of the same cold diseases. According to the Opponent, the claimed antiviral use did not distinguish itself from the prior art, as this use was neither associated with a new patient group nor with a new clinical situation and did not provide any reason for a changed treatment of patients in practice.

9.2 According to the established case law of the Boards of Appeal, the novelty of a therapeutic application of a substance or substance mixture directed at a previously unknown technical effect is to be recognized if this technical effect is associated with a new clinical situation (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 10th edition, 2022, I.C.7.2.4 under c; see in particular T 836/01 (Reasons 8-10) and T 1955/09 (Reasons 10-11)).

The defined antiviral effect against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses is undeniably a previously unknown effect of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline. In the Board's opinion, this antiviral effect is associated with a new clinical situation in the treatment of acute rhinitis and influenza with oxymetazoline and xylometazoline, namely the situation where it is appropriate to direct the treatment or prophylaxis of the defined diseases towards the disease-causing viral infection. Thus, the claimed antiviral effect of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline provides the basis for a new practical treatment approach, in which, for example, the combination of oxymetazoline or xylometazoline with previously known antiviral agents described in document D37 (see D37, claims 1 and 7) can be adjusted or even rendered obsolete.

The situation in the present case is therefore different from that in decision T 233/96 (see Reasons 8.7), which dealt with the question of further distinguishing the prior art by an expressly defined patient group, and from the cases decided in T 254/93 (see Reasons 4.2-4.8) and T 779/18 (see Reasons 4.3-c), in which the claimed effects did not involve a truly new therapeutic use and did not provide a reason for a changed treatment.

9.3 Therefore, the subject matter of claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 2 meets the requirement of novelty.

10. Inventive Step (Auxiliary Request 2)

10.1 Closest Prior Art

10.1.1 The Opponent referred in its arguments regarding inventive step to the content of the documents cited in relation to novelty, particularly to the use of oxymetazoline or xylometazoline with other active substances described in documents D8 and D37.

According to document D8, the use of oxymetazoline or xylometazoline-containing nasal therapeutics is known to lead to a decongestion of the nasal mucosa in rhinitis caused by viral infections of the nasopharynx (see D8, column 1, lines 5-26). The healing effect of these common nasal therapeutics can be significantly accelerated according to document D8 by combined use with plant-based active substances from Echinacea species, preferably in a mixture (see D8, column 1, line 68 to column 2, line 8 and column 2, lines 19-25 and 49-54). These plant-based active substances are also suitable for preventive treatment in the case of an impending infection (see D8, column 2, lines 26-32).

Document D37 describes the treatment of rhinitis and similar diseases, such as influenza, with antiviral agents effective against rhinoviruses or influenza viruses in combination with anti-inflammatory agents, with additional alpha-sympathomimetics, such as oxymetazoline and xylometazoline, being used (see D37, claims 1 and 7 as well as page 24, line 29 to page 25, line 1).

As explained in the above section 9, the difference of the subject matter of Auxiliary Request 2 compared to the documents cited in relation to novelty, including documents D8 and D37, is the specifically defined targeted antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses in the treatment of acute rhinitis and influenza.

10.1.2 Document D1, also cited by the Opponent as a starting point in the prior art, describes the inhibition of HSV reactivation by alpha-sympathomimetics, such as oxymetazoline (see D1, page 7, lines 16-25). In comparison to the subject matter of Auxiliary Request 2, it concerns an efficacy regarding entirely different pathogens and diseases. In the Board's opinion, document D1 therefore represents a clearly less relevant starting point in the prior art and is thus not considered the closest prior art.

10.2 Formulation of the Objective Technical Problem

10.2.1 The claimed antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses represents a functional feature of the subject matter, which has been sufficiently disclosed in the patent for the reasons explained in the above section 7. The Opponent's objection that the antiviral efficacy has not been demonstrated for the entire scope of the claim and is therefore not relevant for establishing an inventive step is thus unfounded.

10.2.2 As presented by the Opponent, the claimed antiviral use of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline does not exclude the use of these active substances in combination with other medicinal products, including other antiviral agents. However, there is no reason to deny the technical effect of the specifically defined targeted antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline when used in combination with other antiviral agents.

Contrary to the Opponent's argument, the specifically defined targeted antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses thus also represents the effective technical contribution of the subject matter compared to the use of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline according to documents D8 and D37, in which the combination with other medicinal products, including antiviral agents, was described, but not the specifically defined targeted antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline.

10.2.3 According to the Opponent, the specifically defined antiviral efficacy is at best a bonus effect that should not be considered in formulating the objective technical problem.

According to the case law of the Boards of Appeal, technical effects associated with the distinguishing features of a claimed invention are exceptionally not to be considered when formulating the objective technical problem if the skilled person had to arrive at the claimed subject matter inevitably because alternatives to solve a realistic technical problem were lacking, placing the skilled person in a so-called ""one-way street situation"" (see T 192/82, OJ EPO 1984, 415; see also Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the EPO, 10th edition 2022, I.D.10.8).

In light of the availability of alternative treatment approaches described in documents D8 and D37, the Board sees no reason, in line with this case law, to dismiss the specifically defined antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline as merely a bonus effect.

10.2.4 In view of the specifically defined antiviral efficacy, which both represents the difference from the prior art and constitutes its effect, the Board agrees with the Patent Proprietor that the objective technical problem is to provide a new approach to the treatment of the defined diseases.

10.3 Assessment of the Solution

In the Board's opinion, no prior art provides a promising expectation for the specifically defined antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline in the treatment of acute rhinitis and influenza.

Document D37 does mention the use of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline in connection with the treatment of cold diseases caused by rhinoviruses or influenza viruses. However, as noted in the above section 10.1.1, the active substances oxymetazoline and xylometazoline are explicitly referred to in document D37 only as alpha-sympathomimetics that can be used as an adjunct to treatment with antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents (see D37, claims 1 and 7 as well as page 24, line 29 to page 25, line 1). Contrary to the Opponent's assertion, the Board believes that the skilled person cannot reasonably conclude from this that oxymetazoline and xylometazoline also exhibit antiviral efficacy.

As also noted in the above section 10.1.1, document D8 describes oxymetazoline and xylometazoline only for decongesting the nasal mucosa in viral rhinitis and merely mentions the combined use of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline with plant-based active substances from Echinacea species, which are also suitable for preventive treatment in the case of an impending infection. Thus, document D8 also lacks any indication of the specifically defined antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline.

The otherwise cited document D1, as noted in the above section 10.1.2, relates to an efficacy against entirely different pathogens and diseases. Therefore, no promising expectation for the specifically defined antiviral efficacy of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline in the treatment of acute rhinitis and influenza arises from document D1 either.

In this context, the Board finds the Opponent's argument that uncovering the specifically defined antiviral efficacy lies within the routine skills of the skilled person unconvincing, as this argument lacks support in the prior art and thus seems to improperly rely on the findings in the patent.

11. Request for Referral to the Enlarged Board of Appeal

11.1 The Opponent requested that if the Board intends to include document D50 in a reasoning regarding compliance with the requirements of Article 83 EPC, the following question be referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal:

""Is it permissible, in the case of an invention protected by a purpose-limited substance claim within the meaning of Article 54(4) or (5) EPC, where the use feature precisely establishes the distinction from the prior art (here: antiviral efficacy of xylometazoline against rhinoviruses and influenza viruses in the antiviral prophylaxis and/or treatment of acute rhinitis and/or influenza), to subsequently, i.e., only after the filing or priority date, refer to publicly available test data to substantiate the requirements of Article 83 EPC?""

11.2 Article 83 EPC requires that the application discloses the invention clearly and completely so that it can be carried out by a skilled person. If a patent defines a new therapeutic use of substances or substance mixtures in a claim in the format of Article 54(5) EPC, it is, according to established case law, necessary for compliance with Article 83 EPC that the patent credibly demonstrates at the time of its filing that the claimed substances or substance mixtures are indeed suitable for the defined therapeutic use (see G 2/21, Reasons 74). A deficient disclosure cannot be remedied by subsequently published evidence.

In the above section 7, the Board, in accordance with this case law, establishes that the suitability of the specifically defined substances oxymetazoline and xylometazoline for the defined therapeutic use is credibly evident from the patent at the time of its filing and that the Opponent has not raised any serious and substantiated doubts regarding the sufficient disclosure of the claimed invention.

In this context, the reasoning in section 7.4 does not explicitly refer to the subsequently submitted document D50 to supplement a deficient disclosure of the claimed invention in the patent, but only to counter the incorrect information from document D10.

The Board therefore does not find it necessary to refer the question formulated by the Opponent to the Enlarged Board of Appeal regarding Article 112(1) EPC.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2. The request for referral to the Enlarged Board of Appeal is rejected. 3.

II. An opposition was filed against the grant of the patent. The grounds for opposition included lack of novelty and lack of inventive step (Article 100 a) EPC), insufficient disclosure (Article 100 b) EPC), and impermissible extension of content (Article 100 c) EPC).

III. The Opposition Division decided that the patent, in amended form, meets the requirements of the EPC. This decision was based on a main request submitted during the oral proceedings on November 29, 2018.

V. The Opposition Division stated in its decision, in particular, the following:

a) The document D32 submitted within the time limit according to Rule 116 EPC was not admitted into the proceedings.

b) The main request meets the requirements of Article 123 (2) EPC. In particular, an injection solution consisting of the claimed mRNA and injection buffer in combination with its use for the claimed treatments is disclosed in the original application.

c) The main request satisfies the requirements of Article 83 EPC. The examples and figures of the contested patent demonstrate the advantageous effect of the claimed injection buffer on the transfer and translation of mRNA dissolved therein. Furthermore, no serious doubts substantiated by verifiable facts regarding the feasibility were raised.

d) The main request meets the requirements of Article 54 EPC. D1 does not disclose the subject matter at hand, so the claimed priority (D29) is valid and D1 is not relevant for assessing novelty. D2 is therefore not novelty-destroying or relevant prior art. Starting from D24, a multiple selection must be made to arrive at the claimed subject matter.

e) The closest prior art is D17. The increase in mRNA translation efficiency is achieved in D17 by modifying the mRNA, whereas the said increase according to the present main request is achieved by the presence of sodium, calcium, and potassium salts. The underlying technical problem of the main request is therefore to provide an alternative solution for enhancing mRNA expression. Neither D17 nor the other cited documents suggest that the choice of an injection buffer containing calcium ions could be crucial for the translation of the mRNA dissolved therein. Thus, the subject matter of the claims of the main request is inventive.

VI. Opponents 1 and 2 (Appellant 1 and Appellant 2) filed an appeal against the above decision.

VII. In response to the statement of grounds of appeal, the Respondent submitted a main request, the claims of which corresponded to those of the main request submitted during the oral proceedings before the Opposition Division, as well as 10 auxiliary requests (Auxiliary Requests 1-10).

VIII. In its communication pursuant to Article 15 (1) RPBA 2020 dated December 14, 2021, the Board communicated its preliminary opinion. In particular, the Board raised a new objection under Article 123 (2) EPC against claim 9 of the then main request due to the deletion of the word ""aqueous.""

IX. By letter dated January 17, 2022, the Respondent submitted 10 further auxiliary requests (Auxiliary Requests 11-20). During the oral proceedings on May 24, 2022, it submitted a new main request.

X. The independent claims of the main request submitted during the oral proceedings read:

""1. Use of mRNA and an aqueous injection buffer containing a sodium salt, a calcium salt, and a potassium salt for the manufacture of a medicinal product for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of cancer or tumor diseases, allergies, autoimmune diseases, viral and/or bacterial infections, for gene therapy or for vaccination, in particular antiviral vaccination, for the prevention of the aforementioned diseases, wherein the medicinal product contains an mRNA injection solution to enhance mRNA transfer and/or mRNA translation in a host organism, and the mRNA injection solution is administered intradermally, intraepithelially, intraperitoneally, or intranodally.""

""9. mRNA injection solution for enhancing mRNA transfer and/or mRNA translation in a host organism, containing mRNA and an aqueous injection buffer that includes a sodium salt, a calcium salt, and a potassium salt, for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of cancer or tumor diseases, allergies, autoimmune diseases, viral and/or bacterial infections, for gene therapy or for vaccination, in particular for antiviral vaccination, for the prevention of the aforementioned diseases, wherein the mRNA injection solution is administered intradermally, intraepithelially, intraperitoneally, or intranodally.""

XII. Oral proceedings before the Board took place on May 24, 2022.

XIII. Appellant 1 and Appellant 2 (Opponents 1 and 2) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

Furthermore, Appellant 1 requested the admission of document D32 into the proceedings.

During the oral proceedings, Appellant 2 requested that the main request submitted during the oral proceedings on May 24, 2022, not be admitted into the proceedings.

XIV. The Respondent (patent owner) requested the maintenance of the patent on the basis of the main request submitted during the oral proceedings on May 24, 2022.

Furthermore, the Respondent requested that documents D32, D35, D36b, D37, D38, as well as D44 to D47 not be admitted into the proceedings.

In addition, it requested that the following submissions explained in the letter from Appellant 2 dated March 23, 2022, not be admitted into the appeal proceedings:

- the submission regarding Article 83 EPC based on document D33,

- the submission based on documents D35 and D45 regarding Article 54 EPC, and

- the submission regarding Article 123(2) EPC.

Finally, the Respondent requested that the newly raised objection during the oral proceedings under Article 123 (2) EPC (linking the therapeutic use with a non-specific injection buffer) not be admitted into the proceedings.

XV. The relevant arguments of the appellant parties for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) Documents D32, D35, D36b, D37, and D44 to D47 should be admitted into the proceedings. In particular, D36b, D37, and D44 to D47 are highly relevant to the patentability issue. D44 to D47 were also submitted in response to the Board's preliminary opinion.

b) The submissions made in the letter dated March 23, 2022, and during the oral proceedings regarding Articles 123 (2), 83, and 54 EPC should be admitted, as they arise from already presented arguments or general technical knowledge.

c) The main request submitted during the oral proceedings should not be admitted as late.

d) The main request violates the requirements of Article 123 (2) EPC. Claim 1 now encompasses embodiments that were not originally disclosed due to its rephrasing. Furthermore, the combination of features defined in claim 1 was not originally disclosed.

e) The main request does not meet the requirements of Article 83 EPC. In particular, the claimed therapeutic effect has not been credibly demonstrated across the entire claimed breadth. The lack of specification of a reference buffer and the osmolarity in the claims also leads to insufficient disclosure. Finally, documents D31 and D32 disclose the existence of non-functional embodiments.

f) The subject matter of claim 1 of the main request is not novel. Document D1 discloses injection solutions according to the present claim as well as their injection into the mouse ear. This injection corresponds to or at least overlaps with an intradermal injection. Thus, D1 discloses the same invention as the present main request and constitutes the first application for the corresponding subject matter. The claimed priority of the contested patent is therefore not valid, and documents D1 and D2 are novelty-destroying. Furthermore, document D24 also discloses all features of the present claim 1.

g) The main request does not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC.

According to Appellant 2, starting from D17 as the closest prior art, the claimed subject matter is obvious, as documents D5, D6, and D7 as well as D12, D13, and D14 disclose the advantageous effect of calcium on mRNA transfer and mRNA translation.

According to Appellant 2, document D20 is a better starting point for assessing inventive step than document D17. Starting from D20 as the closest prior art, the claimed subject matter is obvious.

XVI. The relevant arguments of the Respondent for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) The Opposition Division's decision not to admit document D32 into the proceedings was made without legal error and should not be overturned. Documents D35, D36b, D37, and D44 to D47 should not be admitted as they were submitted late.

b) The new submissions made by Appellant 2 in the letter dated March 23, 2022, and during the oral proceedings regarding Articles 123 (2), 83, and 54 EPC should not be admitted as they are late.

c) The main request submitted during the oral proceedings was presented in response to an objection raised during the oral proceedings under Article 123 (2) EPC. The new main request should therefore be admitted into the proceedings.

d) The main request meets the requirements of Article 123 (2) EPC.

e) The contested patent contains sufficient guidance to carry out the claimed subject matter. In particular, test results substantiate the claimed effect. The main request meets the requirements of Article 83 EPC.

f) The main request meets the requirements of Article 54 EPC. Document D1 and document D2, insofar as the latter constitutes relevant prior art, do not directly and unambiguously disclose the claimed administration routes. Starting from D24, the claimed subject matter can only be achieved through multiple selections.

g) The main request meets the requirements of Article 56 EPC. Starting from D17 as the closest prior art, the claimed subject matter is not obvious. None of documents D5 to D7 and D12 to D14 relate to the use of a water-soluble calcium salt in an injection buffer for administering exogenous mRNA.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Admission of Evidence

1.1 Documents D32 and D41

1.1.1 The document D32 submitted by Opponent 1 in the opposition proceedings after the expiry of the opposition period was submitted during the period according to Rule 116(1) EPC. The admission of document D32 was specifically discussed in the contested decision (see page 8, point 2.2.1).

Document D32 contained new facts compared to those presented in the notice of opposition and was not admitted into the opposition proceedings based on the criterion of apparent relevance. The Opposition Division thus exercised its discretion using the correct criterion.

Furthermore, there is no indication that this exercise was carried out in an unreasonable manner. In particular, the Board cannot discern from the arguments of Appellant 1 in its statement of appeal (see pages 14-15, point 2.4.2) how the results of D32 are supposed to demonstrate the non-enablement of the claimed subject matter. According to D32, the failure is attributed to the injection device.

The Board therefore sees no reason to overturn the decision of the Opposition Division not to admit document D32 into the proceedings or to admit the document based on the Board's own discretion.

1.1.2 D41 was submitted by the Respondent in response to D32 with the reply to the appeal. Accordingly, document D41 is also not admitted into the proceedings.

1.2 Documents D35, D36b, D37, and D38

1.2.1 Documents D35, D36b, D37, and D38 were introduced with the statements of appeal of Appellant 1 (D35) and Appellant 2 (D36b and D37) before January 1, 2020. The admission of these documents is therefore to be assessed according to Article 12(4) RPBA 2007 (Article 25(2) RPBA 2020). Since no reference was made to D38 in connection with the main request, its admission will not be further justified.

1.2.2 D35 is intended to demonstrate the superiority of an injection in the auricle for vaccination purposes (see statement of appeal page 17, 3rd paragraph) and was submitted in response to the Opposition Division's decision that D1 would not disclose the subject matter of the main request (see decision page 11, last paragraph). This document thus supports the argument already made by Appellant 1 in the first-instance proceedings. In this context, the Respondent argued that this document should have been submitted in the first-instance proceedings. The Board is of the opinion that an opponent cannot be expected to submit all possible evidence for all possible arguments. The Board sees no reason why D35 should have been submitted in the first-instance proceedings. Document D35 is therefore admitted into the proceedings.

1.2.3 D36b was submitted by Appellant 2 as the basis for a new objection of lack of inventive step. This document was published in 2001, i.e., long before the submission of the notice of opposition by Opponent 2 in June 2017. Furthermore, the submission of this document is not in response to the decision of the Opposition Division. Rather, a completely new case was created based on this document. This document should therefore have been submitted in the first-instance proceedings and is consequently not admitted into the proceedings.

1.2.4 Document D37 was submitted as evidence for the composition of the buffer used in D36b. Accordingly, document D37 is also not admitted into the proceedings.

1.3 Documents D44 to D47

1.3.1 Documents D44 to D47 were submitted on March 23, 2022, after the notification of the summons to the oral proceedings of July 12, 2021. The admission of these documents is therefore to be assessed according to Article 13(2) RPBA 2020, which applies in the present case according to Article 25(1) RPBA 2020.

1.3.2 Appellant 2 argued that these documents were submitted in response to the preliminary opinion of the Board to document general technical knowledge regarding the anatomy of the mouse ear and injections therein. According to Appellant 2, in particular, D45 clarified that the injections illustrated in the contested patent and in D1 were equivalent. Thus, documents D44 to D47 would demonstrate that D1 would directly and unambiguously disclose an intradermal injection. Therefore, documents D44 to D47 would be highly relevant for a proper clarification of the novelty issue in response to the preliminary opinion of the Board.

1.3.3 The question of a factual disclosure of an intradermal injection in D1 has been disputed since the beginning of the proceedings. The concerns expressed by the Board in its preliminary opinion were also fully based on points that had already been discussed by the parties and in the first-instance decision. Only the documents already cited by the appealing parties in this context (D35, D33, and D8) were considered unconvincing to fill the gaps in the disclosure of D1. However, this cannot provide grounds for the late submission of further documents to support the same and already extensively discussed argument. The Board therefore does not see any exceptional circumstances in the present case that would justify the admission of the late-filed documents D44 to D47 (Article 13(2) RPBA 2020).

1.3.4 Contrary to the opinion of Appellant 2, documents D44 to D47 also do not provide evidence for general technical knowledge.

Document D44, which is used in connection with D35, is a scientific article that concerns a very specific technical teaching. Such an article cannot be attributed to general technical knowledge.

Documents D45 to D47 consist of the statement of a single expert, her CV, and a document cited in this statement. The statement concerns the comparison of the experiments conducted in the contested patent and D1 and the interpretation of the term ""intradermal"" from the patent. This subject matter is specifically directed at the contested patent and document D1 and therefore does not belong to general technical knowledge.

1.3.5 Consequently, documents D44 to D47 are not admitted into the proceedings.

2. Admission of New Submissions

2.1 Submission regarding Article 123(2) EPC

2.1.1 The Respondent argued that the submission made by Appellant 2 in the letter of March 23, 2022, regarding Article 123(2) EPC should not be admitted as it was late.

The Board notes that these are the following attacks:

a) Claim 1 of the main request filed on November 29, 2018, cannot be readily traced back to claim 1 of the originally filed application due to their different categories (manufacturing process for a medicinal product intended for specific therapeutic uses versus ""use claim"").

b) A multiple selection (namely (i) of the specific routes of administration and (ii) of the specific RNA formulations) must be made from various lists of the original application to arrive at the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request filed on November 29, 2018.

c) The claimed routes of administration were originally disclosed only in combination with the use of an ""injection syringe."" Since this feature was not included in the claims, it leads to an extension of the claimed subject matter.

Appellant 2 stated during the oral proceedings regarding attack (b) that it would arise from the previous written submission of Appellant 1. The Board notes that although Appellant 1 had indeed raised the argument of a multiple selection from various lists, it concerned different lists and features than those of the said attack (b). This attack was therefore presented for the first time in the letter of Appellant 2 dated March 23, 2022, just like attacks (a) and (c). They thus represent a change in the submissions of Appellant 2.

2.1.2 During the oral proceedings, Appellant 2 argued that the claimed therapeutic uses were disclosed in the original application exclusively in connection with a specific injection buffer, namely Ringer's lactate (see pages 25-26 of the original application). Since the present claim 1, however, defined a much broader injection buffer, there would be a violation of Article 123(2) EPC. Appellant 2 stated that this attack was already included in the letter of March 23, 2022, but did not cite a specific paragraph. The Respondent requested that this late attack not be admitted into the proceedings.

Contrary to the assertion of Appellant 2, this new attack was not formulated in the letter of March 23, 2022. This attack was therefore presented for the very first time during the oral proceedings on May 24, 2022, and thus represents a change in the submissions of Appellant 2.

2.1.3 Article 13(2) RPBA 2020, which applies in the present case according to Article 25(1) RPBA 2020, states that such changes at this point ""are generally not taken into account unless the party concerned has shown compelling reasons that exceptional circumstances exist."" In the present case, Appellant 2 has not provided any exceptional circumstances, let alone compelling reasons for this.

2.1.4 The new submissions made in the letter of March 23, 2022, and during the oral proceedings regarding Article 123(2) EPC are therefore not admitted into the proceedings (Article 13(2) RPBA 2020).

2.2 Submission regarding Article 83 EPC based on Document D33

2.2.1 The Respondent stated that the submission made by Appellant 2 in the letter of March 23, 2022, regarding Article 83 EPC based on D33 should not be admitted as it was late. The Respondent explained that document D33 had already been cited in the first-instance proceedings and that no party had referred to it in connection with the question of enablement so far. Thus, there were no exceptional circumstances that could justify admission.

2.2.2 Appellant 2 argued that his submission based on D33 was made in response to the preliminary opinion of the Board regarding ""common"" routes of administration. D33 was intended to demonstrate that there are no common routes of administration that achieve calculable effects. This does not represent a new submission but serves to support already mentioned concerns.

2.2.3 The Board is of the opinion that this submission by Appellant 2 was indeed made in response to a point that was clearly raised in the preliminary opinion. Accordingly, exceptional circumstances exist that justify the admission of this submission into the proceedings. This submission is also not complex and does not lead to any procedural delay. Thus, it is admitted into the proceedings (Article 13(1) and 13(2) RPBA).

2.3 Submission regarding Article 54 EPC based on Document D35

2.3.1 The Respondent objected that the submission made by Appellant 2 in the letter of March 23, 2022, regarding Article 54 EPC based on document D35 should not be admitted as it was late.

2.3.2 Appellant 2 stated that this submission is highly relevant for the question of novelty. Furthermore, it would represent general technical knowledge.

2.3.3 In his letter of March 23, 2022, Appellant 2 followed for the first time in the proceedings the objection of lack of novelty raised originally by Appellant 1 against D1 (see point 3.2.1). He referred to the document D35 submitted by Appellant 1, which was supposed to prove that an intradermal injection into the mouse auricle is not limited to the dermis. The injection performed in the contested patent according to D35 is therefore not a purely intradermal administration. Consequently, the injections described in D1 and in the contested patent would be equivalent.

2.3.4 The Board points out that this submission differs from that of Appellant 1. Appellant 1 indeed concluded in her statement of appeal (see page 17, 5th paragraph) that the injection in the auricle in D1 would mean nothing other than an intradermal/intraepithelial injection for the skilled person. The new submission of Appellant 2 therefore represents a change in his submissions. This new submission also does not represent general technical knowledge, as it is based on an experimental result from a scientific article.

2.3.5 Contrary to the provision of Article 13(2) RPBA (see 2.1.3), Appellant 2 has not provided any exceptional circumstances, let alone compelling reasons that could justify the admission of this change.

2.3.6 The submission made in the letter of March 23, 2022, regarding Article 54 EPC based on D35 is therefore not admitted into the proceedings (Article 13(2) RPBA 2020).

Main Request

3. Admission

3.1 The main request was submitted by the Respondent during the oral proceedings. Its admission is therefore to be assessed according to Article 13(1) and 13(2) RPBA 2020.

3.2 The main request is based on the auxiliary request 9 submitted with the reply to the appeal or the auxiliary request 19 submitted with the letter of January 17, 2022, with the following words introduced into the respective claims 9:

a) ""for prevention"" before ""the aforementioned diseases"" (auxiliary requests 9 and 19), and

b) ""aqueous"" before ""injection buffer"" (auxiliary request 9).

There was neither a request for non-admission of auxiliary request 9 nor of auxiliary request 19, and the Board sees no reason that could question the admission of these requests.

3.3 Regarding the amendment (a), according to the Respondent, an error occurred during the preparation of the auxiliary requests. The wording ""for the prevention of the aforementioned diseases"" should have been introduced into both of their independent claims 1 and 9 to address the objection raised by Appellant 1 in her statement of appeal under Article 123(2) EPC. The Board notes that this intention is evident in the letter of January 17, 2022 (see page 1, third paragraph). Furthermore, the absence of the words ""for prevention"" in claim 9 and the associated violation of Article 123(2) EPC was first criticized during the oral proceedings by Appellant 2, and the amendment (a) was made in response to this.

3.4 The amendment (b) was already made in the auxiliary request 19 submitted with the letter of January 17, 2022, to address the objection raised by the Board for the first time in its preliminary opinion of December 14, 2021, under Article 123(2) EPC.

3.5 According to the Board, the new main request thus constitutes a legitimate and direct response to the preliminary opinion of the Board and the deficiency identified by Appellant 2 during the oral proceedings. Accordingly, exceptional circumstances exist that justify the admission of this main request into the proceedings. Both amendments are not complex, address the objections under Article 123(2) EPC, and do not raise new questions. Thus, the new main request is admitted into the proceedings (Article 13(1) and 13(2) RPBA).

4. Amendments

4.1 The independent claims 1 and 9 of the main request (see point X above) are based on the originally filed claim 1, wherein:

(a) the claim has been reformulated as a Swiss-type claim (see claim 1) or according to Article 54(5) EPC (see claim 9),

(b) ""if applicable"" has been deleted, so that the presence of potassium salt is no longer optional,

(c) RNA has been restricted to mRNA,

(d) the route of administration has been defined, and

(e) the use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of certain diseases as well as in gene therapy or vaccination for the prevention of these certain diseases has been claimed.

4.2 Amendment (a)

4.2.1 The appealing parties argued that as a result of the chosen reformulation as a Swiss-type claim (amendment (a)), the present claim 1 now encompassed the following embodiments that were not originally disclosed:

- according to Appellant 1, only the injection solution and not the drug was to be administered according to a specific route, meaning that another undefined component of the drug could also be administered according to a different route,

- according to Appellant 2, the drug defined in the present claim 1 contained an mRNA and an injection buffer as well as an injection solution, which, however, would not necessarily consist of the aforementioned mRNA and the injection buffer.

4.2.2 The Board is of the opinion that the reformulation in Swiss format is clearly and directly derivable from the original application. In particular, the paragraphs on page 25, line 20 to page 26, line 9 disclose the use of both the RNA and the injection buffer as well as the RNA injection solution ""for the manufacture of a medicinal product for the treatment and/or prophylaxis"" of the claimed diseases as well as for gene therapy or vaccination for the prevention of these diseases (emphasis by the author).

It was also undisputed that the original application discloses the use of an injection solution consisting of mRNA and injection buffer to enhance RNA transfer and/or RNA translation as well as for the claimed therapeutic treatment (see, for example, page 4, lines 11-19 and page 25, line 30 to page 26, line 9).

4.2.3 The arguments of the appealing parties regarding the definition of the claimed drug concern the interpretation of the present claim 1 and therefore rather represent a question of clarity.

According to the Board, the skilled person would understand the present claim 1 to mean that the claimed medicinal product contains an mRNA injection solution obtained from mRNA and the injection buffer and is administered according to one of the routes defined in claim 1. The skilled person would indeed expect that an mRNA injection solution contains mRNA and an injection buffer. The assumption that the medicinal product could contain another undefined component and that this could be administered according to a different route cannot further be derived from the wording of the claim.

The Board's interpretation is additionally confirmed by the description (see, for example, contested patent, paragraph [0013], last sentence) as well as the present claim 9.

The interpretations of the appealing parties, on the other hand, are based on an isolated consideration of the present claim 1 and are therefore constructed and formalistic.

Accordingly, the Board is of the opinion that the present claim 1 can only be interpreted in such a way that it does not encompass a further separate injection solution or another undefined component to be administered in different ways. Thus, the subject matter of the present claim 1 does not go beyond the content of the original application.

4.2.4 Appellant 2 argued that this interpretation of the Board does not require the reading in of broader features. Even a discrepancy between the claims and the description is not a reason to ignore the clear linguistic structure of a claim. The Board's interpretation is therefore contrary to the established case law of the Boards of Appeal, as expressed in T 1646/12, T 431/03, T 197/10, and T 2221/10.

The Board does not share the view of Appellant 2 that the linguistic structure of the present claim 1 clearly leads to his interpretation. In particular, the presence of a functional definition of the injection solution does not exclude that the injection solution contains the mRNA and the injection buffer (which is actually sensible from a technical standpoint). The present case thus differs from the cases underlying the decisions T 431/03, T 197/10, and T 2221/10.

Furthermore, the Board's interpretation does not require the reading in of limiting features disclosed solely in the description. The Board's interpretation is primarily based on the understanding of the claim wording from the perspective of the skilled person. The description and the further present claim 9 merely confirm this interpretation. In this respect, the remark of Appellant 2 based on the decision T 1646/12 does not apply in the present case. In this context, the Board points out that T 1646/12 actually expresses that a claim cannot be considered completely separate from the description. According to T 1646/12, the skilled person cannot avoid looking for clarifying elements in the remaining claims, but also in the description and the figures, even in the case of unclear claims.

4.3 Amendments (b) to (e)

4.3.1 The Board further notes the following:

- The amendment (b) was not contested.

- mRNA (amendment (c)) is disclosed as a preferred embodiment on the original page 11, lines 4-9.

- The routes of administration (amendment (d)) are disclosed on the original page 29, line 27 to original page 30, line 2.

- The claimed diseases as well as vaccination and gene therapy for their prevention (amendment (e)) are disclosed on the following original pages: page 25, line 20 to page 26, line 9 and page 29, lines 4-19.

4.3.2 Appellant 1 was of the opinion that a selection from several lists would have to be made to arrive at the present subject matter of claim 1 of the main request. The present combination of features was therefore not originally disclosed.

4.3.3 This argument is unconvincing. Only four routes of administration were selected from a list of 9 alternatives and introduced together with other independent and individualized or preferred features in claim 1. The Board is of the opinion that the combination of preferred features with a selection of alternatives of another feature in the present case is directly and unambiguously derivable from the original application.

4.4 The claims of the main request therefore meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

4.5 The appealing parties raised no objection under Article 123(3) EPC. The Board considers the requirements of Article 123(3) EPC for the main request to be fulfilled.

5. Sufficient Disclosure

5.1 The independent claims 1 and 9 are Swiss-type or purpose-limited product claims. To meet the requirements of Article 83 EPC, the contested patent must enable the skilled person to achieve the claimed medical effect. The point disputed in the appeal proceedings primarily concerned the achievement of this effect, particularly across the entire breadth of the claims.

5.2 The examples and figures of the contested patent demonstrate the advantageous effect of the claimed injection buffer on the transfer and translation of mRNA dissolved therein compared to common buffers (see in particular Figures 1 and 2). The description also provides instructions regarding the preparation of the injection solution (e.g., salt concentrations, RNA amounts, counterions, other possible components, pH, etc.; see, for example, contested patent paragraphs [0014], [0015], [0017], [0018], [0022]-[0025], [0059]). Finally, it is part of the general technical knowledge that mRNA can be used in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the claimed diseases (see also page 1 of the contested patent).

5.3 Regarding the arguments of the appealing parties, the following should be noted:

5.3.1 According to Appellant 1, a significant feature, namely the osmolarity, was not specified in the claims. Appellant 2 further argued that the results of the contested patent could only be achieved under specific conditions (in particular ion concentrations and osmolarity), and thus could not demonstrate the possible implementation of the invention across the entire breadth of the claims.

5.3.2 As already noted by the Opposition Division, Figure 7 shows luciferase expression even at lower osmolarity. Furthermore, the experiment for Figure 7 was conducted under specific conditions (lactate-containing buffer, specific mRNA, mRNA amount), so that a generalization of the minimum values obtained thereunder seems questionable. The skilled person would therefore not necessarily have identified the value of 170 mOsm as a significant feature. In any case, when assessing enablement, the entire disclosure of the contested patent must be considered. As already mentioned in point 5.2, the contested patent provides information on the preferred ion concentrations. The paragraph regarding Figure 7 on page 14 further teaches that osmolarity can be increased to enhance the efficiency of transfer/translation. The skilled person would thus find in the contested patent a teaching regarding the concentrations to be used as well as regarding the possible adjustment of osmolarity to achieve the claimed effect. The Board sees no reason to doubt that using appropriate possibly adjusted concentrations, efficient transfer and/or efficient translation can be achieved.

5.3.3 Appellant 1 further argued that the lack of specification of a reference buffer in the claims led to insufficient disclosure.

5.3.4 As Appellant 1 herself mentioned, the description teaches that the increase in transfer/translation is observed compared to conventionally used standard buffers for RNA such as HBS or PBS (see page 10, paragraph [0051] of the contested patent). This is also confirmed in the examples. As already noted in point 5.3.1, when assessing enablement, the entire disclosure of the contested patent must be considered. Since the contested patent specifies reference buffers, this objection seems to be merely a question of clarity. The remaining arguments of Appellant 1 regarding the effect of each individual claimed salt cannot be followed. The claims refer to a buffer containing all three salts. For such buffers, an increase compared to standard buffers has indeed been demonstrated (see Figure 1 of the contested patent).

5.3.5 Furthermore, Appellant 1 based her argumentation on D31 regarding the alleged presence of non-working embodiments.

5.3.6 D31 is a subsequently published scientific article discussing the clinical data of two mRNA-based vaccines (RNActive®) from Curevac, CV9103 and CV9104. As stated by the Respondent, D31 does not contain any information regarding the formulation of the mRNA in the mentioned RNActive®, particularly regarding the carriers. Therefore, it cannot be inferred from D31 whether the mentioned mRNA compositions were formulated with a buffer corresponding to the present claims. While it can be inferred from the document D3 cited by Appellant 1 that the vaccines tested in D3 (including CV9103) contain an mRNA mixture complexed in a Ringer's lactate buffer, D3 does not refer to CV9104, and the teaching of D3 does not represent a general teaching regarding subsequent RNActive®. It therefore does not seem to be directly and unambiguously derivable that CV9104 also contains a claimed buffer. Since D31 only indicates that CV9104 has proven to be inefficient (i.e., CV9103 is efficient), the failure cannot be unequivocally attributed to the claimed buffer. As pointed out by the Respondent, there are also other possible causes for the failure of treatment with CV9104, such as an insufficient dose of mRNA, the quality of the transcribed mRNA, an insufficient number of ""boosters,"" or a poorly selected patient cohort. Finally, the Board would like to point out that the present claim merely states that the claimed buffer leads to an increase in the transfer/translation of a therapeutically effective mRNA. Appellant 1 doubted that this could be achieved for every possible mRNA. However, no verifiable facts were submitted to support this argument, as D31, as already explained, is not suitable for this. Consequently, the Board does not recognize how D31 could represent a non-working embodiment of the present claim 1.

5.3.7 Appellant 2 further argued that the claimed therapeutic effect was not credible across the entire claimed breadth. The results of the contested patent, which were achieved under an intradermal administration in the auricle of mice, could not be extrapolated to the further claimed routes of administration.

In particular, Appellant 2 stated that according to the contested patent, translation under intradermal injection would occur selectively in fibroblasts (see Figure 8A). Since this cell type was not present in the epithelium, successful epithelial administration was doubtful. The other claimed routes of administration also did not contain the same density of fibroblasts as the mouse auricle, so that achieving the claimed effect for these routes of administration was also not credible.

Furthermore, it was noted in D33 (see page 5, first column, second paragraph) that, unlike an injection into the auricle, an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of identical RNA formulations did not provoke an immune response. According to Appellant 2, D33 thus demonstrated that experimental results obtained with a specific route of administration could not be generalized to further routes of administration.

Appellant 2 further stated generally that the same route of administration could be suitable for one RNA formulation and unsuitable for another RNA formulation.

Finally, Appellant 2 stated during the oral proceedings that Figure 9B actually demonstrated the non-occurrence of the claimed effect in a human injection. According to Appellant 2, the absolute values of the various luciferase tests could be compared because they were standardized according to paragraph [0088] of the contested patent. The absolute level of translation in humans with the claimed buffer (see Figure 9B) was lower than that in mice with common buffers (see PBS and HBS Figure 1). Thus, it was demonstrated that no increase in translation occurred in humans.

5.3.8 These arguments are unconvincing.

Selective translation in a specific cell type under an intradermal route of administration is not suitable to demonstrate a non-successful administration via further routes. The absence of experimental data in the contested patent regarding other routes of administration than the intradermal route does not constitute evidence of non-enablement.

The results of D33 concern routes of administration (intramuscular or subcutaneous) that are not claimed in the present main request. The formulation of the mRNA in D33 also does not correspond to the present formulation (no use of a buffer according to the present claims in D33). Even if the observations of D33 could potentially question the generalization of results for different routes of administration, they do not provide actual evidence that the claimed effect cannot be achieved through the claimed routes of administration.

The fact that one route of administration is better suited for a specific mRNA than another is also not evidence thereof.

Finally, the absolute values of the luciferase tests in mice and humans cannot be directly compared. The standardization mentioned in paragraph [0088] refers to the same experiment. The results of Figures 1 and 9B cannot be directly compared, as fundamentally different conditions (including the affected tissues and thus cell types) were used in the respective experiments. Therefore, a non-occurrence of the claimed effect in humans cannot be inferred from the contested patent.

The statements of Appellant 2 therefore do not present serious doubts about enablement supported by verifiable facts.

5.3.9 Appellant 2 also argued that the contested patent did not demonstrate that the level of expression was sufficient to generate an immunological response.

5.3.10 As explained by the Respondent, luciferase expression tests are common in the present field. The Board notes that the expression results at least make the claimed effect regarding the increase in transfer/translation plausible. As already mentioned in point 5.2, the relationship between mRNA and the claimed medical treatments is considered known. In the absence of any counter-evidence, this argument is therefore unconvincing.

5.3.11 Finally, Appellant 2 emphasized that a therapeutic effect of mRNA in gene therapy was not credible.

5.3.12 The Board points out that gene therapy is a general term that originally referred to the medical method of introducing nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) into body cells to change their genetic material and thus primarily treat genetically caused diseases. Meanwhile, the use of mRNA to produce a functional protein has also been referred to as gene therapy. That such therapy requires a permanent treatment of the patient is not a question of enablement.

5.4 Consequently, the main request meets the requirements of Article 83 EPC.

6. Novelty

6.1 Novelty over D1 or D2

6.1.1 The appealing parties based their objections of lack of novelty against D1 essentially on the argument that the injection described in D1 into the auricle corresponded to or at least overlapped with an intradermal injection.

6.1.2 D1 merely discloses injections into the ears of mice. The specific claimed routes of administration are not mentioned. As stated by the Opposition Division, the auricle contains both elastic cartilage, connective tissue, as well as skin and muscle. A specific intradermal or intraepithelial injection is therefore not directly and unambiguously disclosed in D1. The passages cited by Appellant 1 from documents D35, D33, and D8 do not provide evidence for such general technical knowledge. D8 is a subsequently published scientific article that cannot provide evidence for general technical knowledge prior to the priority or filing date. D33 and D35 are also scientific articles that mention an intraepithelial or intradermal injection into the auricle (see D33, page 3, left column and D35, page 790, left column, first full paragraph) but without stating that an injection into the ear necessarily corresponds to an intraepithelial or intradermal injection.

6.1.3 Appellant 2 argued that considering the thickness of the various skin layers of a mouse ear, with an injection into the mouse ear according to D1, at least part of the solution must have entered the dermis. However, as explained by the Respondent, the administration site and the site of action cannot be equated. Diffusion of the active ingredient after any administration usually occurs without the route of administration per se being considered altered.

6.1.4 During the oral proceedings, Appellant 2 argued in this context that the approach followed in T 1001/01 regarding the route of administration could be applied in the present case. The Board notes that in T 1001/01, the parenteral administration disclosed in the prior art was considered detrimental to the claimed intravenous administration, among other reasons, because the intravenous administration was not particularly preferred over other parenteral routes originally (see point 3.2). In the present case, a generally defined parenteral route of administration was never considered, as the administration was originally already limited to specific injections. Given this difference between the two cases, the conclusion of T 1001/01 is not applicable in the present case. Furthermore, it should be noted that the decision T 1001/01 was published before the decision G 2/08. According to G 2/08, a new specific application in the form of a new route of administration, i.e., also a new route of administration, may exist.

6.1.5 Consequently, the invention described in D1 is not the same as that in the present main request. Contrary to the opinion of the appealing parties, D1 cannot therefore represent the first application in the sense of Article 87(4) EPC. It was not disputed that D29 (the priority document of the contested patent) discloses the same invention as the main request, so that the claimed priority is valid. Consequently, D1 does not belong to the relevant prior art for the question of novelty.

6.1.6 D2 claims priority from D1. Insofar as D2 discloses the same subject matter as D1, this priority is valid, and D2 is therefore relevant prior art for the question of novelty according to Article 54(3) EPC. As explained in point 6.1.2, however, the corresponding disclosure is not detrimental to the subject matter of the claims of the main request. Regarding the subject matter of D2 that goes beyond the disclosure of D1, in particular the feature of intradermal administration, no priority from D1 can be validly claimed. Consequently, the corresponding subject matter of D2 does not belong to the relevant prior art for the question of novelty.

6.2 Novelty over D24

6.2.1 The disclosure of D24 generally encompasses the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request. However, to arrive at the specific claimed subject matter, the following features must be selected:

(i) the Ringer solution as a buffer from the list on column 12, lines 64-65,

(ii) ""pathogen induced diseases,"" ""immunological disorder,"" ""vaccine"" as medical uses, insofar as they actually correspond to the claimed use, from the list on column 14, lines 14-21 and 29, and

(iii) the intradermal route of administration from the list on column 14, lines 37-39.

6.2.2 None of these features is particularly preferred in D24. D24 also does not contain a specific teaching to work with the combination of these features. D24 does not therefore anticipate the novelty of the present claims.

6.2.3 Appellant 2 was of the opinion that the features disclosed on the same column (ii) and (iii) corresponded entirely to the claimed features, so that no selection needed to be made. Consequently, only the buffer (feature (i)) had to be selected. A simple selection from a list would therefore anticipate the novelty. This argument is not comprehensible. Even if the features (ii) and (iii) are disclosed in the same column, specific diseases and the intradermal route of administration must still be selected from two lists. In particular, metabolic disorders, hormonal diseases, neurological diseases, and circulatory diseases cannot be considered as corresponding to the claimed diseases.

6.2.4 In the written proceedings, Appellant 2 raised the same argument regarding the application of T 1001/01 in the present case as already presented in connection with D1 (see point 6.1.4). The Board is of the opinion for the same reasons as before that the approach followed in T 1001/01 is not applicable here. The Board further notes that even if an intradermal route of administration were disclosed in D24, the issue of the disclosure of the specific buffer in combination with the specific medical use remains unchanged.

6.3 During the oral proceedings, Appellant 2 withdrew his objection raised in the written proceedings based on D20.

6.4 Consequently, the main request meets the requirements of Article 54 EPC.

7. Inventive Step

7.1 Closest Prior Art

7.1.1 Appellant 1 and the Respondent argued starting from D17 as the closest prior art. Appellant 2, however, considered D17 unsuitable. During the oral proceedings, he instead considered D20 as the closest prior art.

7.1.2 Appellant 2 argued in this regard that the closest prior art should not only concern the same purpose as the claims of the main request but should also exhibit the least number of structural or functional differences from the claimed subject matter. In his view, D20 (see page 1370, left column, 4th paragraph under ""Materials and Methods""; page 1371, left column, 1st paragraph; Table 1) concerned the same purpose as the contested patent, namely the provision of mRNA formulations for medical applications. Furthermore, D20 disclosed mRNA formulations in DPBS, which according to D21 contained sodium, potassium, and calcium salts. The skilled person would indeed have chosen the buffer with calcium, as it corresponded to the original Dulbecco's buffer. The presence of calcium was thus an inherent feature of D20.

7.1.3 This approach is unconvincing. According to the established case law of the Boards of Appeal, the subject matter of the closest prior art should primarily concern the same purpose as the invention claimed in the contested patent (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 9th edition 2019, I.D.3.2.) and furthermore share most technical features with it.

The contested patent concerns mRNA injection solutions for use in medical applications (including the treatment of tumors and viral infections) that achieve an increase in mRNA transfer and/or mRNA translation (see claims 1 and 9).

D17 relates to an mRNA composition for gene therapy and genetic vaccination against tumors. The problem of achieving efficient transfer and efficient translation is discussed in paragraphs [0031]-[0033] and [0037]. This is solved by modifying the mRNA. Furthermore, the examples describe the intradermal injection of mRNA dissolved in an aqueous buffer. The type of buffer is the only differing technical feature compared to the present uses.

The efficiency of transfer/translation, on the other hand, is not mentioned in D20, so that D20 does not concern the main purpose of the contested patent. That D20 addresses the treatment of a viral disease is not decisive in this case. The medical application is conditioned in the contested patent as well as in D17 and D20 by the type of mRNA and thus does not represent the core of the claimed invention. This lies solely in the increase in mRNA transfer and/or mRNA translation conditioned by the formulation. Contrary to the assertion of Appellant 2, the subject matter of D20 does not exhibit fewer differences from the claimed invention than the subject matter of D17. The presence of calcium (Ca) in the DPBS buffer used in D20 has not been proven. D21 merely discloses that both Ca-free and Ca-containing DPBS are available. Appellant 2's assertion regarding the choice of the Ca-containing buffer remains a mere assumption. Furthermore, the claimed routes of administration are not disclosed in D20. The subject matter of D20 thus differs from the present uses by the specific selection of the buffer and the type of administration route.

D17 therefore clearly constitutes the closest prior art.

7.2 Difference and Objective Technical Problem

7.2.1 It was undisputed that the subject matter of the present main request differs from the uses disclosed in D17 by the type of buffer.

7.2.2 The effect associated with the presence of calcium in the buffer leading to an increase in mRNA transfer and/or mRNA translation and thus protein expression was also not disputed.

7.2.3 The objective technical problem starting from D17 is therefore to provide an alternative mRNA composition for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of, among other things, cancer or tumor diseases, with increased expression.

7.3 Obviousness of the Solution

7.3.1 Appellant 1 argued that an increase in mRNA translation due to calcium could be derived from documents D5, D6, and D7. Documents D12, D13, and D14 would also disclose an increase in mRNA transfer in the presence of calcium. To solve the present problem, it would have seemed obvious to the skilled person to add calcium to the buffer used in D17 instead of modifying the mRNA.

7.3.2 This line of argument is unconvincing and is based on an ex post facto analysis. The teaching of documents D5, D6, and D7 concerns the role of calcium during endogenous protein synthesis, so that these would not have given the skilled person any hint to add calcium to the injection buffer of an exogenously administered mRNA. Documents D12, D13, and D14 relate to the use of insoluble calcium phosphate particles in in vitro transfection procedures. The skilled person would therefore not have inferred from these documents that the use of calcium salts in mRNA injection buffers would lead to an increase in transfer and/or translation under in vivo injection.

7.3.3 None of the cited documents provides a hint towards the use of a calcium salt in mRNA injection buffers to achieve an increase in mRNA transfer and/or mRNA translation under intradermal injection. Thus, the skilled person would not have arrived at the subject matter of the present independent claim 1 without inventive activity starting from D17.

7.3.4 The same conclusion applies mutatis mutandis to the present independent claim 9.

7.4 The main request therefore meets the requirements of Article 56 EPC.

I. The appeal of the patent holder (Appellant I), as well as the appeals of Opponent 1 and Opponent 2 (Appellants II and III), are directed against the interim decision of the Opposition Division to maintain the European patent EP 1 874 821, titled ""Combination of antibodies with glucocorticoids for the treatment of cancer,"" in amended form based on the main request.

II. The Opposition Division found that the oppositions were admissible. Document D35/35a/35b does not represent prior art under Article 54(2) EPC. Furthermore, the Opposition Division determined that the patent in amended form (""new main request"") and the invention it concerns met the requirements of the EPC, particularly the requirements of Rule 80 EPC, Articles 123 (2) and (3) EPC, as well as Articles 83 and 84 EPC, and Articles 54 and 56 EPC.

III. Claim 1 of the patent, in amended form as deemed admissible by the Opposition Division, reads:

""1. One or more glucocorticoid(s) for use in a method for reducing nonspecific cytokine release in the treatment of cancer and tumor diseases with one or more immunostimulatory trifunctional bispecific antibody(ies) (trAB),

wherein the immunostimulatory trifunctional bispecific antibodies each have at least one specificity against tumor antigen and against a CD marker selected from the group consisting of CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD6, CD8, CD28, and CD44, and

wherein the glucocorticoid is administered temporally before or simultaneously with the antibody(ies).""

IV. The following documents are referred to in this decision:

V. The Chamber issued a communication on August 24, 2022, in accordance with Article 15(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA), summarizing the situation and expressing, in the context of Claim 1 of the ""main request"" (hereinafter ""auxiliary request 1""), inter alia, the preliminary opinion that Document D35 was detrimental to novelty.

VI. A hearing conducted as a video conference took place before the Chamber on January 13, 2023. At the end of the hearing, the Chair announced that the written procedure would be resumed, but the Chamber would issue a reasoned written interim decision on the following points:

- the admissibility of the appeal of the patent holder;

- the admissibility of the oppositions;

- the consideration of statements D91 and D99;

- the public accessibility of the dissertation D35 prior to the filing date and its status as prior art;

- the lack of novelty of the subject matter of auxiliary request 1 in view of Document D35 due to the absence of admissible factual submissions.

VII. The arguments of Appellant I can be summarized as follows:

Admissibility of the appeal of the patent holder

The appeal meets the requirement of Article 108 EPC in conjunction with Rule 99 (1) b) EPC, as the contested decision was clearly identifiable by date and appeal file number. The designation of the contested interim decision as a ""decision"" is harmless, as is the reference to a ""patent application."" A ""decision"" is an act and not a record.

The appeal meets the requirement of Article 108 EPC in conjunction with Rule 99 (2) EPC, as the statement of grounds of appeal was submitted and justified for the legal successor of Dr. Lindhofer, Lindis Biotech GmbH. The transfer of ownership of the contested patent was requested on June 3, 2019. In this letter, the representative also took over representation for the new owner. The statement of grounds for the appeal was clearly submitted in the name of the new patent holder.

The appeal of the patent holder is directed against the finding in the interim decision of the Opposition Division dated February 19, 2019, that the oppositions were admissible. The decision of the Opposition Division is appealable in this respect, while no appeal was possible against its prior rejection of a separate decision on the admissibility of the oppositions. The inadmissibility of the oppositions was justified. A justification as to why the asserted grounds for opposition do not contradict the granted version of the contested patent is not required, nor is a discussion of the substantive reasons for the decision of the Opposition Division, which anyway did not concern the granted version of the patent. The legal consequence of the rejection of the oppositions as inadmissible must necessarily be the maintenance of the contested patent as granted.

Admissibility of the oppositions

According to Rule 142 (4) EPC, ongoing deadlines are interrupted. They begin to run anew after resumption. Unlike Rule 90 (4) EPC 1973, Rule 142 (4) EPC is not limited to deadlines that must be observed by the applicant or patent holder. Rather, any deadline is interrupted.

The opposition period, which was still ongoing on December 27, 2013, was interrupted under Rule 142 (4) EPC, as subsequently determined by the letter from the Legal Department dated October 15, 2014. The proceedings were only resumed on May 4, 2015. The oppositions filed on January 17, 2014, were therefore not validly submitted as they were outside the opposition period. No oppositions were filed after the resumption of the proceedings.

Auxiliary request 1 (maintenance of the patent in the version deemed patentable by the Opposition Division in its interim decision) - Claim 1

Admission of documents D91 and D99 (Article 12 (4) RPBA 2007)

Documents D91 and D99 are not prima facie relevant and could and should have been submitted in the first-instance opposition proceedings. Appellant I expressed doubts about the publication date of Document D35 and the submitted statements D61 and D79 already in submissions dated October 6, 2017 (page 17), November 7, 2017 (pages 19 and 20), and September 6, 2018 (page 13). Therefore, Appellants II and III and the then-opponents should have recognized before the expiration of the deadline under Rule 116 EPC that the proof of the publication date of Document D35 would not be sufficient to consider this document as prior art. They should have submitted corresponding evidence.

The submission of Mr. Krieger's first statement (D79) indeed shows that the opponents did not rely on the preliminary opinion of the Opposition Division.

The opponents attempted to continuously improve their procedural position by submitting new evidence to complete the already initially required proof of the publication date. Their procedural conduct can be qualified as an abuse of process.

Public accessibility of Document D35

Document D35 should not be considered as prior art because it was only made publicly accessible after the filing date of the contested patent.

Mr. Krieger's statements regarding the receipt of the dissertation by the German National Library (DNB) in Frankfurt am Main are questionable. They were not confirmed under oath. Given his role as legal advisor of the DNB, Mr. Krieger is unsuitable to provide information about the significance of a dataset from the central catalog of the DNB.

The accompanying letter with which the two copies of the dissertation were sent to the DNB in Frankfurt am Main is dated February 18, 2005. At that time, however, Mr. Sebastian's doctoral procedure had not yet been completed. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the dissertation was received on the same day at both locations of the DNB in Frankfurt am Main and Leipzig, although it was only sent to the DNB in Frankfurt am Main.

In the dataset from the central catalog of the German National Library concerning Mr. Martin Sebastian's dissertation (appendix to D61 and D79), the date entries under numbers 7100 and 7900 may possibly be pre-announcements that were recorded based on bibliographic data and not based on a physical copy of the dissertation D35.

In assessing public accessibility, a high standard of proof must be applied (case law of the Boards of Appeal, Chapter III.G.4.3.1). This standard of proof is stricter than the standard of proof of balancing probabilities.

Appellant I also referred to discrepancies between the statements D79, D91, and D99 and statements in an email from Ms. Schmid of the ""Usage and Stock Management"" department of the DNB Frankfurt am Main (Document D52) regarding the accessibility of Document D35.

Novelty over Document D35

The Chamber's preliminary opinion that the claimed subject matter is not novel is inconsistent with the established case law summarized in the case law of the Boards of Appeal in Chapter I.C.4.1, referring to decisions such as T 158/96, T 715/03, and T 1859/08 regarding the novelty-destroying effect of ongoing clinical trials. The subject matter of auxiliary request 1 is novel over Document D35, as the document does not disclose the clinical benefit of the treatment. This deficiency was already pointed out on page 88 of Appellant I's response to the appeal. If this line of argument is considered a change in Appellant I's submissions, it is admissible due to the extraordinary circumstance that Document D35 is clearly not novelty-destroying. Furthermore, a discussion of case law is never too late.

VIII. The arguments of Appellants II and III can be summarized as follows:

Admissibility of the appeal of the patent holder

The appeal of the patent holder does not meet the requirement of Article 108 EPC in conjunction with Rule 99 (1) b) EPC, as the appeal refers to a ""decision of the European Patent Office"" regarding a ""patent application."" The appellant, Dr. Horst Lindhofer, was referred to as the ""applicant."" Furthermore, it was requested to overturn the ""decision"" and ""grant European patent application No. 05738161.8-1109 in full."" These details do not indicate the interim decision of the Opposition Division as the subject of the appeal. Clarification based on the file situation was not possible, as alongside the interim decision of the Opposition Division, a multitude of documents from the European Patent Office dated February 19, 2019, could be considered, namely the record according to Rule 124(4) EPC, the acknowledgment of receipt, and the form for the internal delivery of a communication. In particular, the record has the character of a decision. The correction in the submission dated June 19, 2019, cannot remedy the deficiency of the appeal.

The appeal of the patent holder does not meet the requirement of Article 108 EPC in conjunction with Rule 99 (2) EPC either, as the statement of grounds of appeal dated June 19, 2019, was submitted in the name of Dr. Horst Lindhofer. However, at that time, Mr. Lindhofer was no longer entitled to the contested patent, as it had been transferred to Lindis Biotech GmbH before the submission of the statement of grounds of appeal on May 7, 2019. According to decision T 393/15, a clear proof of the transfer of ownership is required for a change of party. This was provided with the request for registration dated June 3, 2019. The statement of grounds of appeal was therefore submitted in the name of a person no longer involved in the proceedings. A statement of grounds of appeal in the name of the legal successor Lindis Biotech GmbH was never submitted, and a correction of the erroneously named Dr. Horst Lindhofer according to Rule 139 EPC was never requested. Due to the lack of a statement of grounds of appeal in its name, the appeal of the patent holder is therefore inadmissible according to decision T 298/97.

The appeal of the patent holder also does not meet the requirement of Article 108 EPC in conjunction with Rule 99 (2) EPC because it is unsubstantiated. The statement of grounds of appeal does not address the grounds for opposition raised at any point and does not explain why these grounds do not contradict the granted version of the patent. This is necessary, as the subject of the appeal according to the main request is the maintenance of the patent in the granted version. The patent holder failed to appeal against the Opposition Division's rejection of the request for an interim decision on the admissibility of the oppositions. Thus, the patent holder has acknowledged the admissibility.

Admissibility of the oppositions

The interruption of a procedure under Rule 142 EPC only causes the interruption of deadlines that must be observed by the applicant or patent holder or their representative. The opposition period does not run against the patent holder (G 9/93) and is therefore not covered by the interruption under Rule 142 EPC. The opposition period cannot be interrupted and begin to run anew contrary to Article 99 (1) EPC.

At the time of the occurrence of the interruption reason, namely the opening of insolvency proceedings against the original patent holder, Trion Pharma GmbH, on December 27, 2013, no oppositions had yet been filed. At that time, no proceedings had been pending before the European Patent Office that could have been interrupted. Only with the effective filing of the oppositions on January 17, 2014, did the opposition proceedings begin as a new procedure distinct from the completed examination procedure. The patent holder's view is illogical, as an interruption of a procedure cannot eliminate it, otherwise a resumption would be excluded. The opposition period itself does not represent a procedure but rather the prerequisite for such.

Auxiliary request 1 (maintenance of the patent in the version deemed patentable by the Opposition Division in its interim decision) - Claim 1

Admission of documents D91 and D99 (Article 12 (4) RPBA 2007)

Documents D91 and D99 are relevant and were not submitted late.

In its preliminary statement of March 9, 2018, the Opposition Division concluded that Mr. Martin Sebastian's dissertation (Document D35) had already been publicly accessible before the filing date of the patent. The public accessibility was clearly evidenced by Document D79. In its submission dated September 6, 2018, and in the oral proceedings before the Opposition Division, the then patent holder posited the thesis that the dataset from the central catalog of the DNB concerning Document D35 might have been created based on metadata from the University of Mainz and not based on a physical copy of the dissertation received by the DNB. This speculative theory prompted the Opposition Division in the oral proceedings to revise its preliminary opinion regarding the public accessibility of Document D35. The opponents should have the opportunity to respond to this new argument presented by the patent holder at a late stage in the opposition proceedings. Documents D91 and D99 were submitted at the earliest possible time and should therefore not be excluded from the appeal proceedings.

Public accessibility of Document D35

Document D35 was cataloged no later than April 7, 2005, and made accessible for inspection in the reading rooms of the DNB at the locations of Frankfurt am Main and Leipzig, and therefore belongs to the prior art in the sense of Article 54 (2) EPC.

The inclusion of the dissertation D35 in the central catalog of the DNB was based on two physical copies of the dissertation that were available at the Frankfurt am Main location when the dataset was created on March 29, 2005. This has been evidenced by statements D79 and D91. One printed copy of the dissertation was subsequently deposited on April 6, 2005, in the stacks of the DNB at the locations of Frankfurt am Main and Leipzig. The bibliographic data of the dissertation were included in the German National Bibliography on May 24, 2005, and the dataset in the central catalog was supplemented.

Novelty over Document D35

Document D35 is novelty-destroying for the subject matter of auxiliary request 1. Until the oral proceedings before the Chamber, Appellant I never disputed this. The new assertion that Document D35 does not disclose the clinical benefit of the compound represents a change in Appellant I's submissions that should not be taken into account, as there are no extraordinary circumstances that could justify such a late change.

IX. The requests made by the parties during the oral proceedings on January 13, 2023, are as follows:

Appellant I (patent holder) requested that the oppositions of Opponents 1 and 2 be dismissed as inadmissible and that the patent be maintained as granted (main request). In the alternative, it requested that the appeals of Appellants II and III be dismissed and that the patent be maintained in the version deemed patentable by the Opposition Division in its interim decision (auxiliary request 1). Furthermore, Appellant I requested the maintenance of the patent in amended form based on one of the auxiliary requests 2 to 11 submitted with the response to the appeal dated December 16, 2019, or based on one of the auxiliary requests 12 and 13 submitted with the letter dated September 22, 2022. Should auxiliary requests 2 to 11 from December 16, 2019, as well as auxiliary requests 12 and 13 from September 22, 2022, not be admitted into the proceedings, Appellant I alternatively requested the maintenance of the patent in amended form based on auxiliary requests 2 to 11 that were submitted in the proceedings before the Opposition Division and specified in the letter dated September 22, 2022 as follows:

Auxiliary request 2 corresponds to auxiliary request 3 from February 16, 2017;

Auxiliary request 3 corresponds to auxiliary request 4 from February 16, 2017;

Auxiliary request 4 corresponds to auxiliary request 6 from February 16, 2017;

Auxiliary request 5 corresponds to auxiliary request 3 from January 16, 2017;

Auxiliary request 6 corresponds to auxiliary request 4 from January 16, 2017;

Auxiliary request 7 corresponds to auxiliary request 11a from October 6, 2017;

Auxiliary request 8 corresponds to auxiliary request 11aa from October 6, 2017;

Auxiliary request 9 corresponds to auxiliary request 11e from October 6, 2017;

Auxiliary request 10 corresponds to auxiliary request 11ii from October 6, 2017;

Auxiliary request 11 corresponds to auxiliary request 22 from March 13, 2017.

Furthermore, Appellant I requested that documents D91, D93 to D95 (A92 to A94), D97 to D99 (A96 to A98), and D100 and D100a be dismissed as late at the discretion of the Board of Appeal. Finally, Appellant I requested that Mr. Lindhofer be allowed to make oral submissions (G 4/95).

Appellant II (Opponent 1) requested that the contested decision be overturned and the patent be revoked in its entirety. Furthermore, it requested that the appeal of Appellant I be dismissed as inadmissible, or that the appeal of Appellant I be dismissed as unfounded should the appeal of the patent holder be deemed admissible.

Appellant II then requested that Mr. Hans-Peter Krieger from the German National Library be heard regarding the public accessibility of Document D35/D35a/D35b prior to the filing date should the public accessibility be disputed by Appellant I.

Appellant II further requested:

- the admission of documents D30-D32 into the appeal proceedings, should they not already be in the proceedings,

- the admission of documents D91 and D100 into the appeal proceedings,

- the non-admission into the appeal proceedings of the auxiliary requests 3 to 5 and 7 to 11 submitted with the response to the appeal, the auxiliary requests 12 and 13 submitted with the letter dated September 22, 2022, as well as the auxiliary requests 2 to 11 specified in the letter dated September 22, 2022 from the opposition proceedings. Appellant II also requested that Mr. Lindhofer be not allowed to make oral submissions.

Finally, Appellant II requested the reimbursement of the appeal fee in case the Board of Appeal finds the lack of novelty over Document D32.

Appellant III (Opponent 2) requested that the contested decision be overturned and the patent be revoked in its entirety. Furthermore, it requested that the appeal of Appellant I be dismissed as inadmissible, or that the appeal of Appellant I be dismissed as unfounded should the appeal of Appellant I be deemed admissible.

Appellant III then requested that Mr. Hans-Peter Krieger, Ms. Barbara Pfeifer, and Mr. Christian Schütz be heard regarding the statements made in statements D79, D99, and D100 or D100a concerning the public accessibility of Document D35/D35a/D35b prior to the filing date through the German National Library should the Board of Appeal have justified doubts about their credibility or regarding the accuracy of the facts presented in documents D79, D99, and D100 or D100a. 

Appellant III further requested:

- the admission of documents D92 to D99 (A91 to A98) into the appeal proceedings,

- the non-admission into the appeal proceedings of the auxiliary requests 2 to 11 submitted with the letter dated December 16, 2019, the auxiliary requests 12 and 13 submitted with the letter dated September 22, 2022, as well as the auxiliary requests 2 to 11 specified in the letter dated September 22, 2022 from the opposition proceedings. Appellant III also requested that Mr. Lindhofer be not allowed to make oral submissions.","Reasons for the Decision

Admissibility of the Appeal by the Patent Holder (Appellant I)

1. The Appellants II and III argued that the appeal of Appellant I was inadmissible. They essentially contended that the appeal by the patent holder did not specify the contested decision, that the appeal was filed in the name of Dr. Horst Lindhofer and thus by a person no longer entitled to the patent, and that the appeal was not sufficiently substantiated (see No. VIII above).

Specification of the Contested Decision (Article 108 EPC in conjunction with Rule 99(1)(b) EPC)

2. The notice of appeal dated April 15, 2019, identifies the contested decision as the ""Decision of the European Patent Office dated February 19, 2019."" In the Chamber's opinion, this undoubtedly refers to the interim decision of the Opposition Division dated February 19, 2019, concerning European Patent No. 1874821. In particular, the appeal number mentioned in the notice of appeal, the application number of the contested patent, and the identity of the appellant and the patent holder involved in the opposition proceedings consistently lead to the mentioned decision. The references to a ""female applicant,"" ""applicant,"" and ""application"" are obvious errors that do not lead to a different decision.

3. The view that the term ""decision"" could also refer to the minutes, the acknowledgment of receipt, or another internal form is, in the Chamber's opinion, incorrect. In the procedural law of the German-speaking contracting states, the term ""decision"" usually refers to a specific category of (court) decisions. However, it is not associated with minutes, acknowledgments of receipt, or similar documents. Therefore, only the interim decision of the Opposition Division dated February 19, 2019, concerning European Patent No. 1874821 can be meant. The notice of appeal by Appellant I thus meets the requirement of Article 108 EPC in conjunction with Rule 99(1)(b) EPC.

Appeal Justification in the Name of the Entitled Person (Article 108, Sentence 3 EPC and Rule 99(2) EPC)

4. The notice of appeal dated April 15, 2019, names the then patent holder Dr. Horst Lindhofer with his name and address as the appellant, thereby fulfilling the requirement of Article 108 EPC in conjunction with Rule 99(1)(a) EPC. The consistency with the application number, the appeal number, and the representative's file number leaves no doubt about the identity of the appellant. The incorrect designation as ""female applicant"" or ""applicant"" is harmless. The patent holder, who is necessarily involved in the opposition proceedings (Article 99(3) EPC), is undoubtedly identifiable as Appellant I. This was not contested by Appellants II and III.

5. On June 3, 2019, before the submission of the appeal justification, the representative of Appellant I requested the registration of the transfer of the contested patent from Dr. Horst Lindhofer to Lindis Biotech GmbH in the European Patent Register. The representative of Dr. Horst Lindhofer also took over the representation for the new holder. However, the request was only processed by the competent legal department of the European Patent Office after the deadline for submitting the appeal justification on July 1, 2019. After rectifying deficiencies (see the communication of July 15, 2019, and the response of July 16, 2019), the legal department communicated on July 22, 2019, the retroactive registration of the transfer of rights effective from June 3, 2019.

6. The appeal justification dated June 19, 2019, names Dr. Horst Lindhofer, who was still listed as the patent holder in the European Patent Register at that time, in the subject line. Appellants II and III argue, citing decisions T 298/97 and T 393/15, that the notice of appeal was submitted on behalf of a person no longer entitled to the contested patent, rendering the appeal unsubstantiated and therefore inadmissible.

7. The Chamber is not convinced by the arguments of Appellants II and III. In the case T 298/97, the opponent filed an appeal, but the appeal justification was submitted by a legally distinct legal entity that was economically connected to the opponent, without any request for the transfer of the opponent's status. It was clear from the appeal justification as a whole that the submission was willfully made in the name of this previously uninvolved legal entity and was therefore unequivocally attributable to it. In contrast, in the present case, a transfer of the patent from the previous patent holder, Dr. Horst Lindhofer, to Lindis Biotech GmbH was requested based on Rule 85 EPC in conjunction with Rule 22 EPC before the submission of the appeal justification.

8. This fact is also relevant for the disputed issue of attributing the appeal justification. It can be left open whether the transfer of rights was effective retroactively to June 3, 2019, with the registration on July 22, 2019, or, following the decision T 393/15 (point 1.3), was already effective based on clear evidence with the request of June 3, 2019 (Rule 85 EPC in conjunction with Rule 22(3) EPC), so that when the appeal justification was submitted on June 19, 2019, Lindis Biotech GmbH could be considered as the legal successor and thus as a party to the proceedings. For this does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the appeal justification of June 19, 2019, is attributable to a person no longer entitled to the contested patent.

9. As Appellant I correctly pointed out, Rule 99(1)(a) EPC applies only to the notice of appeal. Rule 99(2) EPC does not impose a corresponding requirement. The mention of Dr. Horst Lindhofer in the subject line of the appeal justification dated June 19, 2019, therefore does not have the significance of a specification under Rule 99(1)(a) EPC. Together with the other details in the subject line, the mention of Dr. Horst Lindhofer serves to establish a connection of the document to the pending appeal case. Thus, the subject line of the appeal justification dated June 19, 2019 - just like the subject lines of the appeal justifications of Appellants II and III - names all parties to the proceedings according to the then current register status. Therefore, there were no doubts regarding the attribution of the appeal justification dated June 19, 2019, to the patent holder. It is unequivocally clear from the appeal justification of this submission that it was submitted for the person entitled to the contested patent. The ownership is again derived from the transfer request of June 3, 2019, with the same subject line. A correction of the appeal justification dated June 19, 2019, under Rule 139 EPC was therefore not necessary.

10. The further statements of Appellant III regarding the transfer process of October 30, 2015, are not relevant. The argument is that the representative of the then patent holder, Trion Pharma GmbH, adjusted the subject line in the request for extension of time dated November 12, 2015, after the requested transfer and thus clarified that the representative was now acting on behalf of the legal successor. However, it is not apparent how this should prejudice the attribution of the appeal justification dated June 19, 2019. This is already because the wording of the subject line in the submissions from 2015 differs in a significant aspect (Trion Pharma GmbH and Dr. Horst Lindhofer were each explicitly referred to as ""patent holder"") and the circumstances were also different (the registration of the transfer of rights took place on November 9, 2015, thus before the next submission of the patent holder on November 12, 2015). That the representative of Appellant I named Lindis Biotech GmbH in the subject line of the next submission (the request for extension of time dated November 8, 2019) after the registration of the transfer of rights on July 22, 2019, only shows that the subject line was adjusted to the register status. However, this is irrelevant for the attribution of the appeal justification dated June 19, 2019.

11. The authorized representative for Dr. Horst Lindhofer also took over representation for the legal successor, Lindis Biotech GmbH, with the transfer request dated June 3, 2019. In this capacity, he submitted the appeal justification on June 19, 2019. Therefore, from the Chamber's perspective, it is beyond doubt that the appeal justification was submitted by the authorized representative. This was done, as explained, unequivocally for the person entitled to the patent and not - as claimed - for any client of the representative who was only determined later. Article 108, Sentence 3 in conjunction with Rule 99(2) EPC is thus fulfilled.

Appeal (Article 107 EPC) and Justification (Article 108, Sentence 3 EPC in conjunction with Rule 99(2) EPC)

12. The main request of Appellant I is to reject the oppositions as inadmissible and to maintain the patent in the granted version. Appellant III objects that Appellant I has not justified why the asserted grounds for opposition do not oppose the patent in the granted version. It has only pursued the patent to the extent that the Opposition Division considered it patentable in its interim decision and justified this with the response to the appeal regarding patentability. Therefore, a justification in the sense of Article 108, Sentence 3 EPC is lacking. The Chamber cannot follow this argumentation.

13. The admissibility of an opposition is a procedural prerequisite for the substantive examination of the opposition. If an opposition is rejected as inadmissible, it cannot be examined substantively, not even ex officio under Article 114(1) EPC. The opposition proceedings based on the rejected opposition are legally concluded without a decision on the merits (T 925/91, OJ EPO 1995, 469). The rejection of an opposition is therefore an independent procedural decision in the sense of Article 106 EPC, which excludes a substantive examination of the opposition.

14. The request of Appellant I to reject all oppositions filed against the contested patent as inadmissible would consequently mean that, if the request were granted, the contested patent could not be examined substantively and would remain in its original form. The maintenance of the contested patent in the granted version is therefore merely the legal consequence of the rejection of all oppositions as inadmissible, thus not an independent substantive request that requires justification regarding the patentability of the granted version. The justification in the sense of Article 108, Sentence 3 EPC only requires (but nonetheless) an explanation of why the oppositions of Opponent 1 and 2 are inadmissible. Such a justification has been provided by Appellant I, which is why its appeal is also admissible from this perspective.

15. As stated, a decision by the Opposition Division on the admissibility or inadmissibility of an opposition constitutes a procedural decision. In the present case, the Opposition Division rejected the request of the patent holder to reject the oppositions as inadmissible. Thus, the opposition proceedings were not legally concluded, but the grounds for opposition were to be examined substantively. The Opposition Division therefore refrained from deciding separately on the admissibility of the oppositions and did not allow a separate appeal against such an interim decision. Thus, the procedural decision on the admissibility of the oppositions, alongside the substantive decision on the version in which the patent can be maintained in amended form (Article 101(3) EPC), constitutes an independent part of the interim decision of the Opposition Division dated February 19, 2019.

16. Since the request of the patent holder to reject the oppositions as inadmissible was not granted, he was burdened by this procedural part of the contested decision and thus entitled to appeal on this point. If Appellant I were denied the right to challenge the procedural part of the interim decision of February 19, 2019, that burdens her, she would have no legal remedy against it and would have to accept the admissibility of the oppositions.

17. For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that the request of the patent holder and Appellant I to maintain the patent in the version considered patentable by the Opposition Division in its interim decision of February 19, 2019, corresponds to the request to dismiss the appeals of Opponents 1 and 2. In this respect, this request is to be attributed to the response to the appeal of Appellant I, not to its appeal.

18. Since the appeal of Appellant I meets the requirements of Articles 106 to 108 EPC as well as Rule 99 EPC, it is admissible.

Admissibility of the Oppositions

19. Appellant I argues with her appeal that the oppositions of Opponents 1 and 2 (Appellants II and III) were not validly filed. She essentially argues that the oppositions were submitted during a subsequently determined interruption of the opposition proceedings under Rule 142(1)(b) EPC and thus outside an ongoing opposition period. The oppositions should have been refiled within the newly running opposition period after the resumption of the opposition proceedings in accordance with Rule 142(4) EPC. Since this did not happen, the oppositions were not filed in due time and should therefore be rejected as inadmissible.

20. Appellants II and III are correct in agreeing that this argumentation of Appellant I is fundamentally flawed. The interruption of a procedure under Rule 142 EPC presupposes an ongoing procedure before the European Patent Office. A European patent is no longer subject to the legal jurisdiction of the European Patent Office upon its grant, unless an opposition or limitation procedure is initiated (G 1/10, OJ EPO 2013, 194, No. 6 of the Reasons). The valid filing of the oppositions by Opponents 1 and 2 on January 17, 2014, the last day of the opposition period under Article 99(1) EPC, was the prerequisite for the pendency of the opposition proceedings and thus also for an interruption of this procedure.

21. Even if the legal consequences of the interruption arise from the existence of the interruption prerequisites (in this case, the opening of insolvency proceedings against Trion Pharma GmbH on December 27, 2013) and not only from their determination and registration (in this case, with the letter from the legal department of the European Patent Office dated October 15, 2014, and publication in the European Patent Bulletin dated November 19, 2014 (47/2014, page 977)) (cf. T 854/12, No. 1.1.1 of the Reasons), these consequences cannot affect the oppositions filed in between, which establish the jurisdiction of the European Patent Office and the pendency of the proceedings. The ""interruption of the proceedings"" in the sense of Rule 142 EPC cannot, in other words, result in the ""elimination of the proceedings,"" as this would also exclude a resumption. As Appellants II and III correctly pointed out, an ongoing opposition period does not yet constitute a pending procedure before the European Patent Office, but merely a temporal limit for its filing. An interruption can therefore only apply from the time of the valid filing of the oppositions, but cannot exclude them. In this respect, the statement in the letter from the legal department of the European Patent Office dated October 15, 2014, that the opposition proceedings were interrupted as of December 27, 2013, misinterprets the requirement of a pending procedure. According to the correct view, the opposition proceedings were only interrupted after their pendency by the valid filing of the oppositions. For this reason alone, the appeal of Appellant I must fail.

22. The view of Appellant I cannot be followed for another reason, as Rule 142(4) EPC, as the Opposition Division correctly stated (see point 1.3 of the Reasons for the contested decision), is not applicable to deadlines such as the opposition period under Article 99(1) EPC, which must be adhered to neither by the applicant nor by the patent holder (see regarding the opposition period G 9/93, OJ EPO 1994, 891).

This is already supported by the wording of Rule 142 EPC. Paragraph 1 lists the reasons for an interruption. These exclusively concern the (lack of) legal or procedural capacity (understood as the ability to perform procedural acts) of the applicant or patent holder or their representative. The legal or procedural incapacity of other parties to the proceedings besides the patent holder does not constitute a ground for interruption. Such parties are mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 3. However, these paragraphs only indicate that the parties in the proceedings before the European Patent Office are also involved in the interruption and resumption proceedings concerning the applicant or patent holder or their representative. Rule 142(4) EPC finally stipulates the legal consequence of an interruption of the proceedings. From the overall context, it follows that Rule 142(4) EPC refers to deadlines that cannot be observed due to the legal or procedural incapacity of the applicant or patent holder or their representative in the sense of paragraph 1. These are thus deadlines that run for the (legally or procedurally incapacitated) applicant or patent holder. This is confirmed by the two exceptions, which represent deadlines that must be adhered to by the applicant or patent holder.

Since the incapacity of other parties to the proceedings does not constitute a ground for interruption, deadlines running against these parties are disregarded in the application of Rule 142(4) EPC. Thus, only those legal consequences that occurred from the beginning of the interruption until its later determination can be considered irrelevant, which arise from the default of interrupted deadlines that had to be adhered to by the applicant or patent holder or their representative.

23. Appellant I correctly states that paragraph 4 of Rule 142 EPC - unlike Rule 90(4) EPC 1973 - does not explicitly refer to ""deadlines running for the applicant or patent holder."" However, a substantive change in the interruption of a procedure before the EPO under Rule 142 EPC was not intended (Explanations of the revision of the Implementing Regulations, OJ EPO 2003, Special Edition No. 1, page 194: ""Rules 90 to 99 EPC were editorially revised.""; see also the synoptic representation of the Implementing Regulations to the EPC 1973 and the Implementing Regulations to the EPC 2000 with explanations, OJ EPO 2007, Special Edition No. 5, page 226: ""Rule 90 EPC 1973 was streamlined and its wording adapted to the style of the EPC 2000. It has become Rule 142 EPC 2000.""). As explained above, this restriction arises from the context of Rule 142(1) to (3) EPC.

24. The above interpretation also aligns with the purpose of the provision. The interruption is intended to prevent a loss of rights or adverse procedural developments due to a missed deadline when an applicant or patent holder or their representative is prevented from timely taking procedural actions for the reasons stated in Rule 142(1)(a) to (c) EPC (essentially death or legal incapacity). The interruption thus serves to protect the applicant or patent holder (T 54/17, No. 1.5 of the Reasons). However, Rule 142 EPC deliberately does not include opponents as protected parties: If an opponent dies or loses their legal capacity, Rule 84(2) EPC provides that the opposition proceedings can be continued ex officio without the involvement of their heirs or legal representatives. The purpose of Rule 142 EPC does not require that time-bound procedural actions by opponents during the duration of an interruption cannot be legally effective, i.e., preserving deadlines, and must even be repeated after the interruption to be effective. To protect the patent holder, it is sufficient that Rule 142(4) EPC prevents procedural actions by opponents from triggering deadlines for the patent holder during an interruption of the proceedings. Therefore, the purpose of the provision also excludes an interruption of the opposition period, as long as it should still be running after (early) filing of an opposition and the existence of a ground for interruption. To protect the patent holder, it is sufficient that the patent holder's deadline for responding to the oppositions is interrupted.

25. For the above reasons, the oppositions submitted on January 17, 2014, the last day of the opposition period under Article 99(1) EPC, were filed in due time and legally valid. Undisputedly, the oppositions also meet all other requirements of Articles 99(1) and 100 EPC as well as Rules 3(1) and 76(1) and (2) EPC.

26. The oppositions are therefore admissible. The appeal of Appellant I is dismissed for this reason.

Auxiliary Request 1 (Maintenance of the Patent in the Version Considered Patentable by the Opposition Division in its Interim Decision) - Claim 1

Admission of Documents D91 and D99 (Article 12(4) RPBA 2007)

27. Documents D91 and D99 are additional statements from Mr. Hans-Peter Krieger, and from Mr. Hans-Peter Krieger, Ms. Barbara Pfeifer, and Mr. Christian Schütz, alongside Document D79. They were submitted by Appellant II or Appellant III and aim to clarify the uncertainties identified by the Opposition Division in the contested decision regarding the availability of Document D35 at the DNB locations in Frankfurt am Main and Leipzig. However, their admission to the appeal proceedings was contested by Appellant I.

28. Article 12(4) RPBA 2007, which is applicable here regarding the admission of Documents D91 and D99, gives the Chamber the authority to exclude evidence that could have been presented in the first instance. However, there is generally no reason to exercise this authority if the submission of the evidence is an appropriate response to unexpected developments during the oral proceedings before the Opposition Division.

29. In the present case, the Opposition Division expressed in its annex to the summons for oral proceedings dated March 9, 2018 (page 39) the preliminary view that the statement from Mr. Hans-Peter Krieger (Document D79) and the dataset from the central catalog of the DNB regarding the dissertation of Mr. Martin Sebastian (""exhibit A"" to Document D61 and appendix to Document D79) indicated that two copies of the dissertation (Document D35) had been received by the DNB in Frankfurt am Main on or before March 29, 2005. The Opposition Division referred to the patent holder's remark in the letter dated November 7, 2017, that the relevant dataset had been changed, and it was allegedly unclear what content the dataset had at a specific time. However, this argument was considered unconvincing in the Opposition Division's preliminary view, as it did not change the fact that the data of the dissertation had been entered into the database on March 29, 2005.

30. Appellant I argued that the reference in her letter dated November 7, 2017, and also in the letter dated October 6, 2017, to ""information"" concerned the question of whether a physical copy of the dissertation was even available at the DNB in Frankfurt am Main when the dataset was recorded in the central catalog of the DNB. However, the mentioned letters do not allow for such an understanding. The letter dated November 7, 2017, pages 19/20, clearly indicates that the ""information"" referred to the dataset of the central catalog of the DNB (""exhibit A"" to Document D61 and appendix to Document D79) and its content: ""Moreover, what information was actually available before the filing date of the contested patent? Certainly not the dataset in its current form..."". In the letter dated October 6, 2017, page 17, it is stated, referring to the dataset from the central catalog of the DNB, that it remains unclear ""what information was supposed to have been available at the DNB at what time.""

31. It was only in his letter dated September 6, 2018, two months before the oral proceedings before the Opposition Division, that the then patent holder, Dr. Horst Lindhofer, questioned on page 13 whether the DNB in Frankfurt am Main had possessed a physical copy of the dissertation on March 29, 2005. This new objection was decisive for the Opposition Division's decision, which changed its preliminary view regarding the availability of a physical copy of Document D35 at the DNB during the oral proceedings on November 8, 2018 (contested decision, point 7.12.7.4.9).

32. The Chamber agrees with Appellants II and III that such a surprising objection at a very late stage of the proceedings justifies the submission of additional evidence. The submission of Documents D91 and D99 with the appeal justification represents, in the Chamber's opinion, an appropriate and earliest possible response to the late objection of Appellant I and the resulting negative decision of the Opposition Division. In this situation, the accusation by Appellant I that the opposing party has behaved abusively by gradually supplementing its factual presentation and presenting new evidence in installments is unjustified.

33. Therefore, the Chamber decided, in exercising its discretion under Article 12(4) RPBA 2007, not to exclude Documents D91 and D99 from the appeal proceedings.

Public Accessibility of Document D35

34. The Opposition Division admitted Document D35 into the proceedings (see contested decision, point 7.12.6). This decision was not contested. The document is therefore to be considered in the appeal proceedings.

35. Appellants II and III argue, among other things, that the dissertation D35 was publicly accessible at the DNB locations in Frankfurt am Main and Leipzig before the date of the patent application. As evidence, they submitted, among other things, the statement from Mr. Hans-Peter Krieger D79 in the opposition proceedings and the further statements D91 and D99 in the appeal proceedings.

36. In the contested decision, the Opposition Division held that Document D79 did not prove the public accessibility of Document D35, as it was unclear, among other things, whether the entry in the central catalog of the DNB dated March 29, 2005, was based on the receipt of a physical copy of the document or merely on metadata transmitted to the DNB by the University of Mainz.

37. Document D79 includes the following dataset from the central catalog of the DNB as an annex, which is identical in content to the appendix (""exhibit A"") of Document D61.

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

In the statements D91 and D99, it is explained, referring to the dataset reproduced above, that:

- the fields with the identifier 7001 and the field ""Input: 1240"" record the date (March 29, 2005) on which the entry for the dissertation D35 was created in the central catalog of the DNB; the entry for the dissertation D35 was created based not on metadata but on physical copies of the dissertation D35, which can be inferred from the absence of a field with the identifier 2100, which records the date on which the DNB receives any metadata for an entry in the central catalog;

- the field with the identifier 7900 records the date (April 6, 2005) on which a physical copy of the dissertation D35 was placed in the stacks of the DNB at the locations in Frankfurt am Main and Leipzig;

- the dissertation, considering the deposit of a physical copy in the stacks of the DNB at the locations in Frankfurt am Main and Leipzig, was made available to the public for inspection at the latest on April 7, 2005;

- the field ""Change: 9999"" records the date (May 24, 2005) on which the bibliographic data of the dissertation D35 were last changed in the central catalog of the DNB;

- the last change in the dataset of the central catalog of the DNB concerning the dissertation D35 was the entry of its classification in the German National Bibliography in the field with the identifier 2105.

38. The statements D79, D91, and D99 were made by Mr. Hans-Peter Krieger (D79, D91, and D99), Ms. Barbara Pfeifer (D99), and Mr. Christian Schütz (D99). The statements explain the processes at the DNB and the dataset from the central catalog of the DNB reproduced above. The declarants were not involved in the inclusion of the dissertation D35 in the central catalog and in the holdings of the DNB. Consequently, these statements were not made by witnesses in the true sense, as the declarants do not testify based on their own perception. Rather, the statements are made as representatives of the DNB. Mr. Krieger made his statements in his capacity as legal advisor (member of the legal advisory board) and thus as an official representative of the DNB in legal matters. Ms. Pfeiffer, head of the cataloging department of the DNB Frankfurt am Main, and Mr. Schütz, head of the periodicals department of the DNB Frankfurt am Main, have detailed knowledge of the processes at the DNB when a dissertation is received. All three can therefore be considered as experts. In this capacity, they are familiar with the processes and relevant facts that need to be assessed here.

39. There is no reason to doubt the credibility of the declarants or the plausibility of their statements, particularly regarding the accuracy of the explanations concerning the central catalog of the DNB and the receipt, recording, and public availability of Mr. Martin Sebastian's dissertation at the DNB. No familial connections of the declarants to any of the parties involved or personal interests of the declarants in the outcome of the appeal were apparent or demonstrated. The Chamber therefore saw no need to hear the experts in addition to their statements.

40. The statements submitted in the appeal proceedings supplement the explanations available in the opposition proceedings by clarifying that the entries under the identifiers 7100 and 7900 were made based on physical copies of the dissertation and not on metadata. This conclusion arises from the absence of the field with the identifier 2100 in the dataset for the dissertation D35, as well as from the accompanying letter dated February 18, 2005, with which the dissertation was sent to the DNB Frankfurt am Main, which was thus available to the declarants in their statements.

41. Appellant I pointed to the date of the accompanying letter with which the two copies of the dissertation were sent by post to the DNB Frankfurt am Main. The apparent discrepancy arising from the dating of this accompanying letter (February 18, 2005) and the date of Mr. Martin Sebastian's doctoral defense (February 22, 2005) is not sufficient to raise doubts about the statements based on the dataset of the central catalog that two physical copies of the dissertation were available at the DNB at the latest on March 29, 2005. Rather, the time span between the date of the accompanying letter and the inclusion of the dissertation in the central catalog of the DNB suggests that the date of the accompanying letter does not correspond to the date of dispatch. This date cannot, in any case, provide information about the time of receipt of the two physical copies at the DNB and further cannot support the thesis that a metadata record was sent as the basis for the inclusion of the dissertation D35. For in that case, one would expect that the date of the accompanying letter would be after the inclusion of the dissertation in the central catalog on March 29, 2005.

42. Appellant I also saw another inconsistency in that the second copy of the dissertation had to be sent from the DNB Frankfurt am Main to the DNB Leipzig, but nonetheless was recorded in the DNB database on the same day (April 6, 2005) in the stacks in Frankfurt and Leipzig. However, the Chamber cannot find any inconsistency here. The period between March 29, 2005, and April 6, 2005, allows enough time to send a printed copy of the dissertation D35 from the DNB Frankfurt am Main location to Leipzig. That the two copies were coincidentally placed in the stacks at both DNB locations on the same day (albeit at different times) does not contradict the statements and does not raise any doubts that a printed copy was physically available at both DNB locations on April 6, 2005, and was included in the respective holdings.

43. Appellant I also referred to discrepancies between the statements D79, D91, and D99 and statements in an email from Ms. Schmid from the ""Use and Stock Management"" department of the DNB Frankfurt am Main (Document D52) regarding the accessibility of the dissertation D35.

44. The information in Document D52 regarding the earliest possible accessibility of the dissertation D35 is vague but not contradictory to the statements D79, D91, and D99. Document D52 mentions that two (physical) copies of the dissertation were delivered to the DNB in the spring of 2005. This aligns with the statements in Documents D79, D91, and D99, which, however, identify March 29, 2005, as the latest date on which the two physical copies of Document D35 were available. Furthermore, Document D52 states that after ""the formal cataloging,"" the ""title"" (i.e., the dissertation D35) was displayed in issue 05,H06,2623 of the German National Bibliography and was listed in June 2005 in the university thesis directory of the German National Library, making the dissertation searchable. However, these statements do not concern the dataset from the central catalog of the DNB (""exhibit A"" to Document D61 and appendix to Document D79), to which the statements D79, D91, and D99 refer, but rather the inclusion of the dissertation in the university thesis directory of the German National Bibliography. As indicated by the correspondence between the issue number mentioned in Document D52 and the entry in the identifier 2105 of the dataset from the central catalog, it thus concerns the process from May 24, 2005, which led to an amendment of the dataset of the central catalog.

45. The searchability outside the context of the central catalog of the DNB itself is irrelevant for the present case. Therefore, Document D52 does not contradict the conclusions drawn from the statements D79, D91, and D99.

46. The statement in Document D52 that copies of the dissertation D35 were ""approximately in June 2005"" placed in the stacks of the DNB in Frankfurt am Main and Leipzig and were orderable via the catalog, so that they could be inspected and copied in excerpts by registered users upon request, does not raise any doubts about the credibility of the facts substantiated by the statements D79, D91, and D99, but rather confirms them. The approximate period of public accessibility of physical copies at the locations in Frankfurt am Main and Leipzig mentioned in Document D52 remains not only vague and indefinite but is ultimately left open. Document D52 therefore does not raise any legitimate doubts regarding the consistent statements D79, D91, and D99, which name April 7, 2005, as the latest date on which a printed copy of the dissertation D35 was available to the public.

47. Referring particularly to decisions T 329/02 and T 750/94, Appellant I emphasized that the evidence must be evaluated with great care. She cites T 329/02, which states that in this context, the competent body ""must strive for the highest possible degree of certainty regarding the facts relevant to answering the question"" and that the submitted evidence ""must be examined very critically and precisely.""

48. After thorough consideration of the evidence, the Chamber has no doubts that a printed copy of the dissertation by Mr. Martin Sebastian titled ""Immunological Activation Parameters in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Under Therapy with the Bispecific Antibody Removab"" (Document D35) was publicly accessible at the DNB locations in Frankfurt am Main and Leipzig at the latest on April 7, 2005, and could be inspected and copied in excerpts by users. Given the absence of merely remote doubts from the Chamber regarding the above evidentiary result, the standard of proof can be left open.

49. Since Document D35 was, in the Chamber's opinion, publicly accessible at the latest from April 7, 2005, it constitutes prior art under Article 54(2) EPC.

Novelty in Relation to Document D35

50. The Opposition Division concluded (see contested decision, point 7.12.1) that Document D35 was ""potentially detrimental to novelty"" for the subject matter of the main request (Auxiliary Request 1 in the appeal proceedings), but held that the document was not publicly accessible at the relevant time. This obiter dictum of the Opposition Division was taken up by Appellants II and III, who argued in the appeal proceedings that Document D35 was detrimental to the novelty of the subject matter of Claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 1 (see the appeal justification of Appellant II, point 8.2.3, and the appeal justification of Appellant III, point 8.4). The Chamber addressed the issue in its communication under Article 15(1) RPBA dated August 24, 2022, and agreed with the view of Appellants II and III.

51. In the oral proceedings before the Chamber, Appellant I disputed that Document D35 was detrimental to the novelty of the subject matter of Claim 1, arguing that the document does not disclose any clinical benefit. When asked by the Chamber when this was presented in the written submissions, Appellant I referred to page 88 of her response to the appeal. Furthermore, she argued that reference could be made to the case law of the Boards of Appeal at any time.

52. On page 88 of Appellant I's response to the appeal, Auxiliary Requests 7, 8, and 9 are discussed, which were submitted as a precautionary measure to address the objection raised regarding the lack of novelty of the subject matter of Auxiliary Request 1 in relation to Document D35. In this regard, Appellant I states that the subject matter of Auxiliary Requests 7, 8, and 9 differs from that of Auxiliary Request 1 in that it additionally claims a route of administration. In the event that Document D35 were considered the closest prior art, it is further stated that the document does not disclose whether the combined administration of glucocorticoids and bispecific antibodies shows the desired antitumor effect. The paragraph ends with the conclusion that Document D35 cannot lead the skilled person to the present invention.

53. It is clear that this submission does not relate to Auxiliary Request 1 but to Auxiliary Requests 7, 8, and 9 and furthermore does not substantiate novelty but inventive step.

54. The submissions of a party regarding raised grounds for opposition should be clear (Article 12(3) RPBA) and should not be derived from vague hints in irrelevant contexts. It cannot be expected of the opposing party or the Chamber to investigate the statements on page 88 of the response to the appeal against the context (justification of inventive step of subordinate claims submitted to establish novelty) to determine whether this submission might contain relevant arguments regarding the novelty of the subject matter of Auxiliary Request 1 between the lines.

55. In any case, the statements of Appellant I on page 88 do not constitute a substantiated response to the novelty objection raised by Appellants II and III concerning Auxiliary Request 1 based on Document D35. Appellant I only countered this novelty objection regarding Auxiliary Request 1 by disputing the public accessibility of the document before the filing date of the contested patent and attempting to undermine the opposing party's burden of proof regarding the timing of public accessibility. Appellant I did not address the factual submissions of Appellants II and III regarding the disclosure content of Document D35 and the assessment of novelty.

56. Regarding Appellant I's line of argument concerning the possibility of commenting on legal questions at any time, the following should be noted. In the present case, for the discussion of the established case law on the novelty-destroying nature of unfinished clinical trials sought by Appellant I, it would first be necessary to analyze Document D35 in detail and assess its disclosure content regarding the clinical benefit of the therapy evaluated in Document D35.

57. However, since there is a lack of timely and substantiated submissions by Appellant I regarding the disclosure concerning the clinical benefit of Document D35, there is also a lack of a fundamental prerequisite for a discussion of the case law of the Boards of Appeal regarding the novelty-destroying nature of unfinished clinical trials, which requires a technical as well as a legal assessment of established facts and not merely an abstract legal question.

58. The opponents have therefore rightly argued that the assertion that Document D35 is not detrimental to the novelty of the claimed subject matter because no clinical benefit is disclosed represents a substantial change in Appellant I's submissions. The justification for this change - the assertion that Document D35 is clearly not novelty-destroying - cannot be accepted for the reason that this view could have been presented at any stage of the proceedings before the Opposition Division and during the written appeal proceedings.

59. The Chamber therefore decided that this line of argument by the patent holder is not admitted into the proceedings (Article 13(2) RPBA).

60. In the communication under Article 15(1) RPBA, it was stated that Document D35 discloses the simultaneous, separate, or staggered application of at least one claimed immunostimulatory or immunotherapeutic antibody (1st component) and at least one claimed glucocorticoid (prednisolone) (2nd component, as premedication) to reduce nonspecific cytokine release in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of cancer and tumor diseases. This remained unchallenged in the written proceedings. The late submission of Appellant I cannot be taken into account, see point 58. Therefore, there are no reasons for the Chamber to reach a different conclusion than in the communication under Article 15(1) RPBA dated August 24, 2022.

61. Consequently, the subject matter of Claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 1 is not novel in the sense of Article 54 EPC. Accordingly, the patent cannot be maintained based on the request considered grantable by the Opposition Division.

62. The examination of the further requests (see point IX.) could not be completed, which is why the proceedings must continue after the decision on the preceding partial aspects for the points that have not yet been decided.

63. Therefore, it was decided in the oral proceedings to resume the written proceedings.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The appeal of the appellant I (patent holder) is admissible. 2. The oppositions of the opponents 1 and 2 (appellants II and III) are admissible. 3.

I. The present appeal is directed against the decision of the examining division announced at the oral proceedings on September 21, 2018, and posted on October 29, 2018, to refuse European patent application No. 14 700 203.4.

II. During the proceedings before the examining division, the following documents were cited among others:

D3: J Rheumatol 31 (Suppl 71), 13-20 (2004)

D4: Rheumatology 43, 744-749 (2004)

Exhibit A: Animal study ""Leflunomide 15 mg"" (March 2017)

G3: Technical opinion by Prof. Friede (September 2018)

III. The basis for the contested decision was a main request that had been amended compared to the originally filed version of the application and a auxiliary request (""Auxiliary Request 1"").

IV. In the matter, the examining division concluded that the subject matter of the claims of both requests did not involve an inventive step.

Like the present application, the prior art D3, which represents the closest prior art, deals with determining the optimal dosing regimen for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with the active ingredient Leflunomide.

As proposed by the applicants, the technical problem to be solved starting from D3 is to provide an alternative pharmaceutical composition that exhibits non-inferiority compared to a daily dosage of 20 mg Leflunomide in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

While the application itself does not contain experimental data on the efficacy and tolerability of the claimed dosage (administration of a single dose of 15 mg Leflunomide per day), taking into account the documents subsequently submitted by the applicants in this regard (Exhibit A and in particular opinion G3), this technical problem can be considered credibly solved by the subject matter of the claims, provided that non-inferiority is understood as achieving 50% to 80% of the efficacy.

However, to solve the technical problem, the provision of a tablet single dose of 15 mg Leflunomide for once daily administration would have been obvious to the skilled person, as D3 already indicates that daily dosages in the range of 10 mg to 20 mg enable effective treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Even if the technical problem had been to achieve equivalent therapeutic efficacy with a dosage of 20 mg per day, the claimed subject matter would have been obvious.

V. The applicants (appellants) filed an appeal against this decision.

VI. With the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellants submitted another technical opinion:

G4: Technical opinion by Prof. Friede (March 2019)

VII. The claims of the requests submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal as main request and auxiliary request are identical to the claims of the requests dealt with in the contested decision, except for insignificant linguistic corrections. The sole claim of the auxiliary request reads as follows:

""1. Pharmaceutical composition in tablet form comprising Leflunomide for use in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis, characterized in that the composition is prepared as a single dose with 15 mg Leflunomide for once daily administration.""

The feature concerning the preparation was also used in the main request, and there specifically as the only distinguishing feature of a pure product claim directed to Leflunomide tablets without specifying a therapeutic indication.

VIII. The board summoned the appellants to oral proceedings and explained its preliminary assessment in a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal. Among other things, it pointed out that the feature:

""characterized in that the composition is prepared as a single dose with 15 mg Leflunomide for once daily administration""

merely states that a tablet contains 15 mg of active ingredient and does not have any limiting significance (see section 1 of the communication).

IX. In their submission of November 27, 2020, the appellants subsequently presented another request as Auxiliary Request 2.

X. The oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal took place on June 30, 2021.

a) During the proceedings, the appellants withdrew the previous main request and made the auxiliary request submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal their new main request (for the wording of the sole claim see point VII).

b) The previous Auxiliary Request 2 (see point IX) was replaced by a new Auxiliary Request 1. The sole claim of this request reads as follows:

""1. Pharmaceutical composition in tablet form comprising Leflunomide for use in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis, characterized in that the composition is prepared as a single dose with 15 mg Leflunomide for once daily administration and is administered once daily in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis.""

The difference from the wording of the sole claim of the previous Auxiliary Request 2 is that the word ""daily,"" which had previously been inadvertently omitted, was inserted as the third-to-last word.

c) The board admitted the Auxiliary Request 1 submitted during the oral proceedings into the proceedings.

d) After hearing the appellants, the board concluded that the subject matter of neither of the two pending requests involved an inventive step.

XI. The arguments of the appellants can be summarized as follows:

Interpretation of the claim wording

The wording used in claim 1 of the main request ""that the composition is prepared as a single dose with 15 mg Leflunomide for once daily administration"" already implies that the once daily administration is to be regarded as a claim feature and should therefore be taken into account in the assessment of patentability. In the event that the board does not agree with this interpretation, Auxiliary Request 1 is presented with a revised claim wording.

Inventive step

Starting from the prior art D3, the objective technical problem is to provide a pharmaceutical composition in tablet form as a single dose that is equally effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as a 20 mg tablet single dose of Leflunomide, which is administered once daily.

This problem is solved, as mentioned on page 6, paragraph 1 of the application, by the claimed single dose of 15 mg Leflunomide for once daily administration, which has been demonstrated with the experimental report ""Exhibit A"" in a rat model.

In the medical field, the statistical term of non-inferiority has established the concept of therapeutic equivalence. Contrary to the assumption made by the examining division, these terms therefore express the same fact, namely the presence of equal efficacy.

The advantage of the claimed dosing regimen is that - with a lower risk of toxicity and side effects - the same efficacy as with the once daily administration of 20 mg Leflunomide is achieved. This is surprising, as the skilled person would have expected a linear dose-response relationship.

The review article D3 is aimed at specialists. Therefore, the skilled person relevant for the problem-solution approach is a practicing internist/rheumatologist. By usual definition, an average skilled person does not possess the knowledge of international clinical experts such as the authors of D3.

D3 discloses only three daily dosages for Leflunomide, namely 10 mg or 20 mg as maintenance doses and 100 mg as an initial loading dose. Since only the corresponding tablet strengths (10 mg, 20 mg, and 100 mg) were available on the market and Leflunomide was considered a long-known and researched active ingredient, the skilled person would have had no specific reason to examine other strengths or dosages. Certainly, they would not have specifically chosen a single dose of 15 mg per day to achieve the mentioned advantages.

Furthermore, the Leflunomide tablets available on the market at the priority date of the present application did not have score lines that would have allowed for the preparation of dosages of exactly 5 mg or 15 mg of Leflunomide. The relevant skilled person or patient would therefore not have been able to produce the inventive 15 mg dosage of Leflunomide using routine means. The routine activity of the relevant skilled person as a practicing physician does not include developing new tablet strengths and conducting a regulatory approval process for them.

Even if a clinical pharmacologist were assumed to be the skilled person, they would not have routinely dealt with a well-known drug, as their actual task is to identify new active ingredients and efficacies. The originators of Arava**(®) (with the available strengths of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 100 mg) also did not conduct further clinical studies on Leflunomide. The appellants were the first competitors with the tablet strength of 15 mg.

The remarks in D3 regarding dosage optimization (D3: page 16, right column) explain the known practice of switching between the usual dosages of 10 mg and 20 mg per day according to the needs of the respective patient. However, this does not suggest adjusting the dosage to 15 mg per day. Knowing that the daily dose of 10 mg was considered less effective, the skilled person would generally have expected a linear dose-response relationship and thus a lower efficacy for a daily dose of 15 mg compared to 20 mg Leflunomide. Furthermore, Figure 8 in D3 does not indicate the equivalence of these dosages. A non-inferiority study presented in the prior art D4 additionally confirms that the daily dose of 10 mg does not exhibit the desired equivalence.

For these reasons, and since D3 itself (page 14, right column, paragraph 3) names two known and long-established standard therapies, namely treatment with methotrexate or sulfasalazine, as equivalent to treatment with Leflunomide, the relevant skilled person would not have considered changing the dosage of Leflunomide to 15 mg daily. Instead, they would have resorted to the aforementioned standard therapies or to another already known alternative second-line therapeutic agent (""Humira**(®)"") to solve the technical problem.

XII. The appellants requested the annulment of the contested decision and the grant of a patent

- based on the main request (originally submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal as ""Auxiliary Request"");

- alternatively based on Auxiliary Request 1 (submitted during the oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal);

and, should the main request be granted, the reimbursement of the appeal fee.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Admissibility of the Appeal

The appeal meets the requirements of Articles 106 to 108 and Rule 99 EPC; it is admissible.

2. Inventive Step - Auxiliary Request 1

2.1 In the interest of a concise presentation, it seems appropriate in the present case to address the auxiliary request before the main request.

Present Application and Subject Matter of the Claims

2.2 The present application reports on the state of the art and general knowledge (page 1, lines 5 to 18; page 2, lines 20 to 25) that Leflunomide was known as a prodrug active ingredient for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, was being researched for further indications, and that tablets containing 10 mg, 20 mg, and 100 mg of Leflunomide were commercially available. It is further mentioned that according to the product information of the marketed preparation Arava**(®), it is recommended to start treatment for rheumatoid arthritis with a loading dose of 100 mg Leflunomide once daily for three days, followed by a maintenance dose of 10 mg to 20 mg Leflunomide once daily depending on the severity of the disease.

2.3 The objective (page 3, lines 11 to 28) is stated as providing a pharmaceutical composition comprising Leflunomide, the administration of which compared to a once-daily administration of 20 mg or 10 mg Leflunomide

- shows comparable or improved efficacy in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of a list of various diseases (preferably: rheumatoid arthritis) and/or

- allows for a reduction in side effects and/or

- enables a reduction in Leflunomide therapy discontinuations or switches to other therapeutics.

2.4 The application in its originally submitted form proposes to achieve these objectives with single-dose formulated compositions containing 14 to 17.5 mg, preferably 15 mg, of Leflunomide for administration once to four times daily (page 4, lines 5 to 8 and page 4, line 27 to page 5, line 21).

2.5 In contrast, claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 is limited to tablets containing 15 mg of Leflunomide and their once-daily administration specifically for the prophylaxis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

2.6 The text of the application further states (page 6, first paragraph):

""Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention, which contain 14 to 17.5 mg, preferably 15 to 17.5 mg, particularly preferably 15 mg of Leflunomide as a single dose and are administered once daily, surprisingly show comparable or improved efficacy, particularly in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of autoimmune diseases, preferably rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, arthritis as a complication of cystic fibrosis, lupus nephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, uveitis, myasthenia gravis, and/or granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's disease) compared to pharmaceutical compositions that contain 20 mg of Leflunomide as a single dose and are administered once daily.""

The application does not contain experimental data, for example from studies, to support this statement.

Starting Point in the State of the Art

2.7 It was not disputed that document D3 represents a suitable starting point for assessing inventive step.

2.8 D3 reports as a review article on the monotherapy of rheumatoid arthritis with Leflunomide (D3: title and abstract). The objective was to find recommendations for the optimized use of Leflunomide:

""The primary objective of this review is to define recommendations for the optimal use of leflunomide, based on the review of key studies by international experts in rheumatology at a panel meeting held in Paris in 2003."" (D3, page 13, right column),

translated:

""This review primarily aims to define recommendations for the optimal use of Leflunomide. This was based on the review of key studies by international experts in rheumatology at a meeting in Paris in 2003.""

2.9 As also mentioned in the present application (page 2, lines 20-25 in connection with the preparation Arava**(®)), D3 cites common maintenance doses of 10 mg or 20 mg per day, which are to be administered over longer periods (D3: abstract and page 16, column 2 ""Maintenance dose""). In the clinical studies mentioned in D3, Phase III, as well as in an open-label study for further observation of clinical practice, an initial dose of 100 mg Leflunomide was administered for three days, followed by a maintenance dose of 20 mg daily (D3: page 14, left column, lines 1-3; page 15, left column).

2.10 The experts participating in the meeting mentioned in D3 were additionally asked about their experiences and practices in clinical practice (D3: page 16, right column, penultimate paragraph). In this context, it was reported that in the event of side effects, the usual maintenance dose of 20 mg daily could be reduced to 10 mg daily. D3 concludes that it is possible to start maintenance therapy with a daily dose of 10 mg and then switch to 20 mg, or vice versa, and that flexibility in dosing may be appropriate (D3: page 19, left column, last paragraph; and last sentence of the section ""Maintenance dose,"" starting on page 16, right column).

2.11 The Board considers the statements in the paragraph ""Leflunomide: optimal dosing schedule/Maintenance dose"" on page 16 of D3 as the starting point, as this discusses the dosing regimen for the maintenance dose of Leflunomide, which is also the focus of the present application.

2.11.1 In this passage, with reference to a reference article, it is stated that

- Phase II studies with multiple doses of Leflunomide have shown that the steady-state plasma concentration of the active metabolite of Leflunomide (also referred to as A77 1726) determined after 24 days of treatment is proportional to the administered dose,

- and further, that there appears to be a threshold value of plasma concentration regarding treatment success (see Figure 8 in D3). At 10 mg/l, only half of the maximum effect is achieved, while at the threshold of 13 mg/l, a plateau in terms of efficacy (expressed as the probability of clinical success) is reached.

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPH

2.11.2 Since the plasma concentration of the active metabolite is proportional to the administered dose of Leflunomide, the nonlinear relationship shown in Figure 8 with the formation of a plateau must also apply to the relationship between the dose of Leflunomide and efficacy.

2.11.3 Furthermore, D3 (page 16: ""Maintenance dose"") explains that it has been calculated that with a daily dose of 20 mg Leflunomide, at least 95% of patients would reach the relevant value of 13 mg/l for the plasma concentration of the active metabolite (and thus the maximum efficacy), while increasing the dose to 25 mg does not further increase the probability of clinical success. On this basis, a daily dose of 20 mg Leflunomide was recommended for conducting Phase III studies.

Technical Problem and Solution

2.12 Interpretation of Claim 1

2.12.1 Claim 1 of the present auxiliary request 1 corresponds to the format of the purpose-bound product claim provided for further medical uses according to Article 54(5) EPC, with the specific therapeutic application being the prophylaxis and/or treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. This specific application is further characterized by the following dosing instruction:

""that the composition is administered as a single dose of 15 mg Leflunomide [...] once daily.""

2.12.2 It follows that the once-daily administration of 15 mg Leflunomide is considered a claim feature that must be taken into account in the assessment of patentability (G2/08, OJ EPO 10/2010, 456; points 1 and 2).

2.12.3 Although the present claim is not explicitly limited to the treatment of human patients (see also the text of the application on page 8, lines 4 and 23, stating that the patients are ""preferably,"" but not necessarily, human), the Board assumes in the following that the claimed dosing instruction targets the maintenance dose in human patients.

2.13 Distinguishing Features Compared to D3

2.13.1 As is already clear from the title (""The Efficacy of Leflunomide Monotherapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis""), document D3 concerns the monotherapy of rheumatoid arthritis with Leflunomide. In particular, D3 also deals in detail with recommendations for the dosing of Leflunomide in maintenance therapy (D3: page 16, right column; see also points 2.8 and 2.11 above).

Accordingly, the claimed subject matter does not differ from the starting point in D3 in the choice of the active ingredient (in both cases Leflunomide).

2.13.2 Thus, the argument of the appellants must fail, according to which a second-line therapeutic agent would already be selected in a first selection within the technical disclosure of D3, whereby Leflunomide would then be selected again in this context to arrive at the claimed subject matter.

Article 56 EPC requires the presence of an inventive step over the entire state of the art. When applying the problem-solution approach, it is therefore appropriate to assess inventive step particularly from the closest prior art and to choose the closest embodiment within a document as the starting point for the subject matter to be assessed - also with regard to the technical features.

In the present case, however, the entire document D3 deals with therapy using Leflunomide as the active ingredient, with the aim of optimization.

In this context, the approach pursued by the appellants to question the already established selection of the active ingredient in the prior art and to present its renewed selection as part of the solution to the technical problem appears artificially constructed and inappropriate.

The comparison highlighted by the appellants with the known first-line therapeutics Methotrexate and Sulfasalazine is merely mentioned in D3 as a side note in the context that these served as comparator drugs (""active comparator"") in the Leflunomide Phase III studies. It was shown that treatment with 20 mg Leflunomide was at least equivalent to the respective reference therapy regarding the observed proportion of responders according to the ACR 20% criterion (American College of Rheumatology 20% response rate) (D3: page 13, right column, last complete paragraph to page 14, right column, last complete paragraph).

2.13.3 D3 does not provide details on the dosage form used.

2.13.4 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 thus differs from the technical disclosure according to D3 in that Leflunomide is in tablet form, with one tablet containing 15 mg of active ingredient as a single dose to be administered once daily.

2.13.5 As mentioned in the present application (page 2, lines 20 to 25; see also point 2.2 above), Leflunomide was commercially available in the form of tablets containing 10 mg, 20 mg, or 100 mg of active ingredient and was used in this form for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis according to the product information (which represents general knowledge), with the maintenance dose being administered once daily at 10 mg to 20 mg. Since this was the common practice, it can be assumed that the clinical practice discussed in D3 was also based on the once-daily administration of the daily dose in the form of tablets.

The appellants have not argued the presence of an inventive step on the grounds that the claimed dosage form is a tablet (as opposed to another dosage form) or that it is administered once daily (as opposed to another frequency) or as a single dose (as opposed to the simultaneous intake of multiple tablets per dose).

The relevant distinguishing feature for assessing inventive step is thus the once-daily administration of 15 mg instead of 20 mg of Leflunomide in a dosage form as a single dose.

2.14 Technical Effect

2.14.1 According to the appellants, the advantage of the claimed dosing instruction is that the same efficacy as with the once-daily administration of 20 mg Leflunomide is achieved with less active ingredient (therapeutic equivalence or non-inferiority).

2.14.2 As evidence of this alleged technical effect, the study report ""Exhibit A"" was cited in combination with various technical opinions (including G3 and G4). These are supplementary data from a study in an animal model (""PIA"" rat model).

2.14.3 In this context, the question may arise as to whether, in light of the absence of evidence for the claimed technical effect in the application itself (see point 2.6), subsequently submitted experimental data should still be considered.

Given the teachings of D3 and the fact that preparations with specific dosing instructions for the treatment of human patients with rheumatoid arthritis were already on the market, it also seems questionable whether an animal model, which is necessarily further removed from the claimed subject matter than this state of the art, can provide further precise insights into the optimization of dosing in humans.

Furthermore, the non-inferiority margin of 50% assumed by the appellants for statistical verification was not justified with regard to the actual comparability of the effect from the perspective of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but was apparently chosen based on other criteria (alignment with non-inferiority margins published for other therapies and compatibility with the size of the animal study of Exhibit A; see the remarks on this in G3: page 1, penultimate paragraph to page 2, line 2 and G4: pages 2 and 3).

2.14.4 The following considerations regarding the formulation of the technical problem and the obviousness of the solution are based in favor of the appellants on the assumption that the statistical criterion was appropriately chosen and that the claimed technical effect, i.e., the therapeutic equivalence of the doses of 15 mg and 20 mg Leflunomide as a daily dose in humans, is indeed achieved.

Since the result of these considerations found the presence of an inventive step to be denied (see below point 2.23), a further examination of the issues raised under 2.14.3 is not necessary.

2.15 Technical Problem and Solution

2.15.1 Based on the technical teaching of document D3 and considering the claimed technical effect, the objective technical problem underlying the subject matter of claim 1 was to provide a pharmaceutical dosage form containing Leflunomide for administration in rheumatoid arthritis according to a dosing instruction that achieves a comparable, preferably equivalent, efficacy with the use of lower amounts of active ingredient compared to the administration of a daily dose of 20 mg Leflunomide.

2.15.2 As already mentioned (see point 2.14.4), the following considerations assume that the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 solves this technical problem.

Relevant Skilled Person

2.16 The relevant skilled person for assessing an invention is typically one who would usually be entrusted with solving the existing technical problem (T 0097/85, Reasons 8.2.2; T 0422/93, OJ EPO 1997, 25). This skilled person therefore not only has access to the state of the art and general knowledge but also possesses the skills and means to routinely work in the field of the technical problem and to implement the findings in the claimed subject matter.

2.17 In the present case, the relevant skilled person is therefore not, as argued by the appellants, a practicing rheumatologist, but a professional involved in pharmaceutical product development, as the technical problem lies within their usual area of responsibility to provide a medication with an associated dosing instruction.

Within this general framework, there are different areas of responsibility. The pharmaceutical composition claimed here is not characterized by its manufacture, excipients, or galenic features but by the amount of the single dose contained for once-daily administration. The relevant skilled person here is therefore not the pharmaceutical technologist but the clinical pharmacologist, who conducts systematic investigations and studies on dosage and administration and determines the required active ingredient content of the pharmaceutical dosage form in conjunction with the dosing instruction based on the results obtained and specifies it for further implementation in product development. Although such investigations may require some effort, they are in themselves part of the routine activities of the relevant skilled person.

Obviousness of the Solution for the Skilled Person

2.18 From D3 (see points 2.9 to 2.10 above) and from the general knowledge presented in the present application (page 1, line 19 to page 3, line 2), it was known that the usual maintenance dose of 20 mg Leflunomide was effective against rheumatoid arthritis and could be administered once daily as a single dose due to the long half-life of the active metabolite, with tablets being a common dosage form. In the case of severe side effects and/or lower severity or activity of the disease, a reduced maintenance dose of 10 mg daily was recommended, which, however, is known to have lower efficacy than the 20 mg daily dosage.

2.19 The question of balancing efficacy and the occurrence of undesirable side effects routinely arises for the skilled person - in the sense that dosage forms and dosing instructions should be provided to users that enable or facilitate this balance. To facilitate the desired patient-individualized and flexible dosing according to D3, the relevant skilled person would have considered examining further doses between 10 mg and 20 mg anyway - in anticipation of better efficacy than with 10 mg and a reduction in the risk of side effects/toxicity and active ingredient consumption compared to 20 mg. The fact that D3 does not aim at further pharmaceutical product development and therefore does not deal with possible intermediate doses would not have led to a reservation on the part of the skilled person against examining further doses.

2.20 From the technical teaching of D3, there would have been an additional incentive to determine a dose between 10 mg and 20 mg that is characterized by therapeutic equivalence to the 20 mg dose:

2.20.1 As already explained (see points 2.11.1 to 2.11.3), it can be inferred from D3 that in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in humans with Leflunomide, the dose-response relationship does not run linearly across the entire range of therapeutically usable doses (particularly from 10 mg to 25 mg), but that beyond a certain point, further increases in dose do not significantly improve efficacy.

With the daily dose of 20 mg, this plateau of maximum efficacy of Leflunomide is reached according to D3, while this is not confirmed for the other common daily dose of 10 mg (recommended in case of poor tolerability of the 20 mg dose) in D3.

As highlighted by the appellants, it was additionally noted from D4 that in rheumatoid arthritis, non-inferiority (i.e., equivalence) of the dose of 10 mg Leflunomide per day compared to the dose of 20 mg per day is indeed not given (D4: page 744, fourth paragraph: ""Conclusions""; page 746, left column: ""Efficacy""; page 748: ""Efficacy"" to the end of the right column).

2.20.2 The efficacy achievable with 20 mg thus lies on the plateau, while the efficacy achievable with 10 mg lies on the rise before the plateau of the dose-response curve, while D3 does not provide information about intermediate doses and thus does not exclude the possibility that these could achieve an efficacy comparable to that of 20 mg in the plateau range.

2.20.3 In light of this information, it would have been obvious for the skilled person dealing with the objective technical problem to examine daily doses of Leflunomide between 10 mg and 20 mg, including the daily dose of 15 mg, to see whether these could already reach the plateau of maximum efficacy and thus therapeutic equivalence to the daily dose of 20 mg. On this basis, the skilled person would have arrived at the claimed subject matter without inventive step (where the provision of the daily dose as a tablet single dose corresponds to common practice).

2.20.4 The general consideration that such an examination could also have been unsuccessful would not have raised serious doubts that would have prevented the skilled person from examining further daily doses from the outset. The reason studies are conducted at all is that they have uncertain outcomes. However, these are routine trials, and the mere fact that the outcome is uncertain does not make the ultimately determined result inventive.

2.21 The appellants emphasized that Leflunomide was a known active ingredient since 1976, long researched, approved, and unchanged on the market for a long time. Thus, the skilled person had no reason to address the stated problem. Accordingly, the developers of the known drug Arava**(®) never pursued the approach of bringing further tablet strengths to market, and in the course of the non-inferiority study described in D4, the dosage of 15 mg was not investigated.

2.22 This argument is unconvincing for the following reasons:

2.22.1 The relevant skilled person does not only conduct research to find new active ingredients and develop new drugs but also deals with adjustments and improvements to known drugs. The information summarized in the review article D3 and the known need for flexible solutions for patients to be treated with Leflunomide provided a sufficient reason to close existing knowledge gaps and to examine whether further tablet strengths could provide additional benefits.

2.22.2 Business decisions or decisions in scientific research regarding the scope and prioritization of tasks and projects can be influenced by many factors. That other parties, as far as known, had not previously worked on further tablet strengths does not necessarily mean that they would not have seen a chance of success or a worthwhile application. The cited fact is in any case not sufficient evidence of a technical prejudice against implementation.

2.23 For these reasons, the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 does not involve an inventive step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC.

3. Inventive Step - Main Request

3.1 Claim 1 of the main request is drafted in the format according to Article 54(5) EPC, similar to claim 1 of auxiliary request 1, but does not contain the dosing instruction that the tablet single dose of 15 mg ""is administered once daily.""

3.2 However, this does not result in a significant difference for the assessment of the inventive step of the present main request:

3.2.1 If, as argued by the appellants, the interpretation of both claims were identical, the subject matter of the claim would, for the same reasons already stated for auxiliary request 1, be considered non-inventive.

3.2.2 In fact, the wording that the composition in tablet form is ""prepared"" as a single dose with 15 mg Leflunomide only means that each tablet contains 15 mg of Leflunomide and thus is suitable for administration as a single dose of 15 mg. In the case law of the Boards of Appeal, the term ""prepared"" is not attributed any further special meaning.

3.2.3 Although the desired dosing instruction (15 mg daily as a single dose) is referenced in the claim, it is not an obligatory claim feature with the chosen wording.

However, since according to general knowledge (see points 2.2, 2.9, and 2.18) 20 mg Leflunomide is the highest usual daily maintenance dose for rheumatoid arthritis and once-daily administration is the norm, the choice of a higher daily dose (multiples of 15 mg) or less frequent administration would seem impractical.

Given these circumstances, it is also realistic to assume for the main request in the assessment of inventive step that the claimed 15 mg tablets are to be administered particularly once daily as a single dose.

3.2.4 The relevant distinguishing feature compared to the closest prior art D3 is the formulation as a 15 mg single dose, which is thus suitable for once-daily administration of 15 mg Leflunomide.

3.2.5 Assuming, as previously stated (see point 2.14.4), that the therapeutic equivalence of the doses of 15 mg and 20 mg Leflunomide as a daily dose in humans is indeed given, the objective technical problem can be formulated as follows:

Provision of a pharmaceutical dosage form containing Leflunomide for administration in rheumatoid arthritis, which is suitable for administration according to a dosing instruction that achieves a comparable, preferably equivalent, efficacy with the use of lower amounts of active ingredient compared to the administration of a daily dose of 20 mg Leflunomide.

This problem can be considered solved by the subject matter of the claim based on the above assumption.

3.2.6 Aside from the slight modification of the technical problem required by the wording of the claim and any adjustments that may arise therefrom mutatis mutandis in the reasoning, there is no significant difference in the assessment of inventive step compared to claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 (see the remarks in section 2: points 2.2 to 2.22.2).

3.3 Consequently, the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request also does not involve an inventive step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",the application has been refused,the application has been refused,appeal dismissed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeal of the appellant (opponent) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to reject the opposition against European Patent EP 2 363 387 under Article 101(2) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged on the basis of Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC) and lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC), as well as Article 100(b) EPC.

III. Among other things, reference was made to the following documents, which are also referred to in the present proceedings:

IV. The opposition division justified its decision by stating that the invention claimed in the contested patent is disclosed in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art (Article 83 EPC), that the subject matter of the claims is novel in view of the disclosures of the documents submitted in the opposition proceedings (Article 54 EPC), and that it involves an inventive step (Article 56 EPC), particularly starting from the technical teaching of document E1 as the closest prior art.

V. The opponent filed an appeal against this decision in a timely manner.

VI. In its response to the appeal, the respondent (patent proprietor) presented arguments regarding the allowability of its main request - the patent in the granted form - as well as regarding the allowability and patentability of the auxiliary requests 1 to 5 submitted with the same statement, which had already been presented in the opposition proceedings.

VII. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the Board communicated its preliminary opinion to the parties.

VIII. An oral hearing took place on 1 March 2022 in the form of a videoconference.

IX. The present main request contains seven independent claims, of which claims 1 and 8 have the following wording:

1. (Poly-)glycerin partial esters having on average (numerical average) from 0.75 to 2.25 acid residues of one or more carboxylic acids with 10 to 24 carbon atoms and having on average (numerical average) from 0.005 to 0.5 residues of a polyfunctional carboxylic acid, in particular dimer fatty acids, oxalic acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, cork acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, dodecanedioic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, tartronic acid, maleic acid, citric acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, and terephthalic acid, containing polyfunctional carboxylic acid esters (poly-)glycerin partial esters with the provision that after complete hydrolysis of the (poly-)glycerin partial ester, a (poly-)glycerin is obtained which has a homologous distribution with:

Glycerin: 0.01 wt.-% to 20 wt.-%,

Diglycerines: 0.01 wt.-% to 60 wt.-%,

Triglycerines: 0.01 wt.-% to 60 wt.-%,

Tetraglycerines: 0.01 wt.-% to 30 wt.-%,

Pentaglycerines: 0.01 wt.-% to 20 wt.-% and

Oligoglycerines: up to 100 wt.-%.

8. A process for producing a (poly-)glycerin partial ester comprising the steps

A) Providing a (poly-)glycerin having a homologous distribution with

Glycerin: 0.01 to 20 wt.-%

Diglycerines: 0.01 to 60 wt.-%

Triglycerines: 0.01 to 60 wt.-%

Tetraglycerines: 0.01 to 30 wt.-%

Pentaglycerines: 0.01 to 20 wt.-%

Oligoglycerines: up to 100 wt.-%.

B) Esterifying a part of the (poly-)glycerin with one or more carboxylic acids with 10 to 24 carbon atoms and

C) Further esterifying with a polyfunctional carboxylic acid,

wherein the molar ratio of the polyfunctional carboxylic acid used in step C) to the (poly-)glycerin used in step A) is 1:2 to 1:200.

Independent claims 11 and 12 relate to the use of the (poly-)glycerin partial esters of claims 1 to 7, or obtainable by a process of claims 8 to 10, as an emulsifier (claim 11), or for the production of cosmetic or pharmaceutical formulations (claim 12).

Independent claim 13 relates to an emulsifier containing (poly-)glycerin partial esters according to claims 1 to 7 or obtainable by a process according to claims 8 to 10.

Independent claim 14 relates to the use of the (poly-)glycerin partial esters according to claims 1 to 7 or obtainable by a process according to claims 8 to 10 or an emulsifier according to claim 13 for improving the water resistance of cosmetic or pharmaceutical formulations.

Independent claim 15 relates to a cosmetic or pharmaceutical formulation containing (poly-)glycerin partial esters according to claims 1 to 7 or obtainable by a process according to claims 8 to 10.

X. In her statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

The claimed subject matter is not sufficiently disclosed (Article 83 EPC). In particular, the skilled person is unable to produce the compositions according to claims 1 and 2 without undue burden, or to clearly delineate them. The claimed subject matter is at least not novel in view of the disclosure of document E1. This document discloses in the manufacturing example the (poly-)glycerin partial esters claimed in the contested patent, even if a homologous distribution is not explicitly disclosed therein (Article 54 EPC). Novelty is also not given in view of the disclosure of document E15. However, the claimed subject matter does not involve an inventive step starting from the technical teaching of document E1. No improvement of any properties has been shown, and the claimed subject matter is therefore merely a selection from the general teaching of document E1. To support her argument, the appellant referred to experimental evidence described in document E13 (Article 56 EPC).

XI. In her response to the appeal and in the further proceedings, the respondent essentially argued as follows:

The appellant's arguments regarding lack of sufficiency relate only to aspects of lack of clarity (Article 84 EPC) and are therefore not to be considered in the appeal proceedings. Novelty over the disclosure of document E1 is given, as the required homologous distribution of the (poly-)glycerin is not disclosed therein (Article 54 EPC). Likewise, inventive step is present, as the skilled person would not have solved the technical problem of improving the emulsion stability of the claimed (poly-)glycerin partial ester-containing compositions starting from the technical teaching of document E1 through the claimed homologous distribution (Article 56 EPC). Documents E13 and E15 to E17 should have already been submitted in the opposition proceedings. The documents themselves, as well as the arguments based on them, should therefore not be admitted into the proceedings.

XII. Requests of the Parties

The appellant (opponent) requests

- the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of European Patent No. 2 363 387,

- the admission of documents E13 and E15 to E17.

The respondent (patent proprietor) requests

- the dismissal of the appeal, thus the maintenance of the patent in the granted form (main request),

- alternatively, the maintenance of the patent on the basis of one of the auxiliary requests 1 to 5 already submitted before the opposition division,

- the non-admission of documents E13 and E15 to E17,

- alternatively, the referral of the matter back.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Admissibility of documents E13 and E15 to E17 in the proceedings.

2.1 Document E13

2.1.1 Document E13 was submitted by the appellant for the first time in the appeal proceedings, namely together with its statement of appeal on June 17, 2019. Since the document was submitted before the entry into force of the revised Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA) applicable since January 1, 2020, Article 25(2) RPBA allows for the application of Article 12(4) of the version of the RPBA in force prior to that date (RPBA 2007). Accordingly, the Board is not permitted to admit evidence that could have been presented in the first-instance proceedings.

2.1.2 The appellant justified the timing of the submission of document E13 by stating that it was surprised by the decision of the opposition division. It argued in particular that it could have assumed, based on the evidence and arguments it presented in the opposition proceedings, that the opposition division would follow its objection regarding the lack of novelty of the subject matter of claims 1 and 8 of the main request (granted patent) in view of the disclosure of document E1. Since the opposition division only justified its contrary opinion in its decision, the earliest possible time to submit document E13 was chosen with the commencement of the appeal proceedings. The experimental data described in the document demonstrate that the subject matter of claims 1 and 8 of the contested patent is not novel, and therefore the decision of the opposition division is erroneous (Article 54 EPC). Furthermore, the experiments also demonstrate the erroneousness of the decision regarding the grounds of lack of sufficiency of disclosure (Article 100(b) EPC) and lack of inventive step (Article 100(a) and 56 EPC).

2.1.3 This argumentation is not convincing for the following reasons:

The reasoning of the opposition division to reject the opposition, among other reasons, because the appellant's submissions regarding novelty were not considered convincing, cannot have been surprising for the appellant. The contested decision does not refer to facts that were unknown to the appellant, nor does it establish a new context that was previously unknown to the appellant.

Rather, the opposition division refers in its decision to the submissions of the appellant in the opposition proceedings, according to which the disclosure of document E1, in particular through the manufacturing example described on page 4 and the oligomer distribution according to the table on page 3, anticipates the subject matter of claim 1 of the contested patent. The opposition division also specifically considers the appellant's line of argument based on calculations of the homologous distribution in its decision (see points 2.6.2 to 2.6.5 of the contested decision). Therefore, the opposition division arrived at the conclusion that the objection of lack of novelty presented by the appellant was not conclusive, based on the evidence presented by the appellant in the opposition proceedings, particularly document E1, and the arguments derived from it. Thus, this view held by the opposition division must have been foreseeable for the appellant as a possible outcome of the discussions and is therefore not surprising. Furthermore, it was within the appellant's control to present additional evidence or lines of argument in the opposition proceedings that could have potentially reduced the risk of an adverse decision against it. Overall, the appellant's submissions cannot justify the late submission of experimental data only at the beginning of the appeal proceedings.

2.1.4 The Board therefore agrees with the view of the respondent that the document could have been submitted in the opposition proceedings and that the reasons presented by the appellant do not justify the admission of the document at this stage of the proceedings. The document is therefore not admitted into the proceedings (Article 12(4) RPBA 2007).

2.2 Documents E15 to E17

2.2.1 Document E15 and the related experimental data (documents E16 and E17) were submitted by the appellant on August 19, 2021, and thus only after the appeal was filed in accordance with Article 108 EPC. The admission of the documents and the arguments based on them is subject to the conditions of Article 13(1) RPBA.

Accordingly, amendments to the appeal submissions of a party after the submission of its statement of appeal require justifying reasons from the party, and their admission is at the discretion of the Board.

In exercising its discretion, the Board must particularly consider the state of the proceedings, the suitability of the amendment to address questions raised by another party in the appeal proceedings in an admissible manner or questions raised by the Board itself, and to what extent the amendment is detrimental to the procedural economy.

2.2.2 The appellant justified the submission of documents E15 to E17 only at this stage of the appeal proceedings by stating that document E15 relates to agricultural agents and thus to a different class of substances than the contested patent. Therefore, the relevance of the document for assessing the novelty of the subject matter of the contested patent was not initially obvious. However, the document discloses, in several examples, products claimed in the contested patent, and is therefore prima facie relevant. This is evidenced by the additional documents E16 and E17.

2.2.3 This justification cannot justify the admission of the documents into the proceedings.

Since the appeal proceedings primarily serve to judicially review the contested decision, the appeal submissions of the parties must be directed at the evidence underlying the contested decision (Article 12(2) RPBA). This does not apply to documents E15 to E17. Admission of the documents into the proceedings at this time would mean that both document E15 itself and the experimental data submitted with documents E16 and E17 would have to be analyzed and evaluated at a very late stage, namely only during the appeal proceedings. This would be detrimental to procedural economy. The amendment of the appellant's appeal submissions does not resolve any questions raised in the appeal proceedings, as the documents were submitted in relation to the ground of opposition of lack of novelty of the main request, i.e., the granted patent, and this ground of opposition has been part of the proceedings since the beginning of the opposition proceedings.

2.3 Considering these aspects, the Board exercises its discretion not to admit documents E15 to E17, and consequently the novelty objection based on them into the proceedings (Article 13(1) RPBA).

Main Request

3. Sufficiency of Disclosure (Article 100(b) and 83 EPC)

3.1 The appellant based its objection in particular on the fact that the definition of (poly)glycerol partial esters in claim 1 refers to features that pertain not to the claimed product but to a composition that is obtained only after carrying out a hydrolysis reaction that is not defined in the claim. It must be assumed that the homologous distribution of a (poly)glycerol changes during esterification with the acids specified in the claim, as well as during the hydrolysis that must be performed before determining the homologous distribution. Therefore, it is not possible for the skilled person to determine which starting conditions and compounds should be chosen to achieve the oligomer distribution specified in claim 1 after hydrolysis. Furthermore, the formulation used in the claim ""after complete hydrolysis"" allows for the further hydrolysis of polyglycerols and oligoglycerols, and therefore the homologous distribution in the initially formed composition is also altered during hydrolysis. Thus, the homologous distribution in the hydrolyzed composition depends on both the conditions for producing the claimed (poly)glycerol partial esters and the hydrolysis conditions of these (poly)glycerol partial esters. It can therefore vary widely. Without precise specification of the reactants for the synthesis of the claimed compounds, as well as the conditions for synthesis and hydrolysis, the subject matter of the claim is therefore not sufficiently disclosed.

Further objections were raised only in the written proceedings. In this regard, the appellant initially referred to the term ""oligoglycerols"" in claim 1. In its view, due to a lack of information in the contested patent, the skilled person cannot make a clear distinction between oligoglycerols and polyglycerols. However, this is essential for the definition of the claimed subject matter, which relates to (poly)glycerol partial esters. With regard to claim 2, the appellant argued that formula (I) also includes ether compounds, namely when the substituent R**(4) of formula (I) corresponds to a residue of general formula (II). However, ether bonds are also formed under the conditions of examples 1 to 5 of the contested patent, particularly between the glycerol homologs themselves. These conditions thus lead to a changed oligomer distribution in the hydrolyzed composition compared to the starting distribution of the (poly)glycerol used.

3.2 The appellant's submissions are not convincing.

3.2.1 In the present case, the requirements of Article 83 EPC are met if the skilled person is enabled by the information in the contested patent itself and with the help of general technical knowledge to produce the (poly)glycerol partial esters defined in claim 1, to carry out the process according to claim 8, to use the compounds according to claims 11, 12, and 14, and also to produce emulsifiers according to claim 13 and formulations according to claim 15. To substantiate a lack of sufficiency of disclosure, there must be serious doubts about the sufficiency, supported by verifiable facts.

3.2.2 This is not the case here.

Claim 1 of the contested patent refers to (poly)glycerol partial esters. The claimed products are initially defined by having a certain content of acid residues of certain carboxylic acids - carboxylic acids with 10 to 24 carbon atoms as well as polyfunctional carboxylic acids - that they contain polyfunctional carboxylic acid ester-(poly)glycerol partial esters, and that after complete hydrolysis of the claimed (poly)glycerol partial esters, a (poly)glycerol is obtained, which has a homologous distribution of various glycerols and oligoglycerols specified in the claim. In paragraph [0019] of the description, the conditions under which the claimed (poly)glycerol partial ester can be hydrolyzed are described.

3.2.3 Even if, as argued by the appellant and not disputed by the respondent, changes in the homologous distribution occur both during the formation of the claimed esters and during their hydrolysis before determining the homologous composition, this does not mean that the skilled person is unable to adjust the selection of starting materials and the exact synthesis conditions accordingly to obtain a claim-compliant homologous distribution after hydrolysis. The appellant left open why this should not be possible or in what way this would represent an unreasonable effort for the skilled person. Regarding the hydrolysis conditions, the Board notes that these are detailed in the contested patent itself (paragraphs [0019] to [0021]). It was also not shown in what way the examples described in the contested patent cannot be reproduced or why they do not represent claim-compliant embodiments.

3.2.4 The objection raised regarding the distinction between the terms ""polyglycerol"" and ""oligoglycerol"" is also not convincing. From claim 1, the skilled person derives that ""oligoglycerols"" include more than five glycerol units. The term ""polyglycerol"" is explained in the contested patent itself (paragraphs [0018] and [0033]), and it is also known to the skilled person from the prior art (see for example E1, page 3, from line 24).

3.2.5 Finally, the appellant's submissions regarding possible changes in the homologous distribution in connection with the formation of citric acid ethers with reference to claim 2 of the contested patent were not substantiated by verifiable facts. Here too, it must be assumed that the skilled person knows suitable experimental conditions to carry out specific reactions, possibly to avoid them, or to adjust them based on the respective product compositions obtained.

3.3 The appellant's submissions are therefore not suitable to substantiate a lack of sufficiency of disclosure. The main request meets the requirements of Article 83 EPC, and the corresponding conclusion of the opposition division stands.

4. Novelty (Article 100(a) and 54 EPC)

4.1 The opposition division recognized novelty over the disclosure of document E1. The appellant contested this assessment, particularly with reference to the manufacturing example disclosed on page 4 of this document.

4.2 In the mentioned manufacturing example, the production of a (poly)glycerol partial ester is disclosed. For this purpose, technical (poly)glycerol with a hydroxyl number of 1180 is first esterified with isostearic acid and then with dimer acid. This was undisputed between the parties. It was also undisputed between the parties that the acids used, isostearic acid and dimer acid, fall under the definition of a carboxylic acid with 10 to 24 carbon atoms or a polyfunctional acid in the sense of the definitions of claims 1 and 8 of the contested patent. It was also undisputed that the respective proportions of the acid residues contained in the formed esters are 2.21 and 0.44, which lie within the ranges required by the claims (claim 1: 0.75 to 2.25 for the carboxylic acid and 0.005 to 0.5 for the polyfunctional acid; claim 8: molar ratio of polyfunctional carboxylic acid to (poly)glycerol 1:2 to 1:200). These values calculated by the appellant were not disputed by the respondent. It was also not disputed that from the hydroxyl number of 1180 indicated for the (poly)glycerol used in the example, a mean degree of polymerization of 2.9 can be calculated according to the method described in the contested patent itself.

4.3 However, it was disputed between the parties whether the (poly)glycerol used in the mentioned manufacturing example is also disclosed with the homologous distribution specified in claims 1 and 8, and whether this distribution corresponds to the distribution after complete hydrolysis, in particular whether glycerol is represented in the hydrolyzed composition with a content of up to a maximum of 20 wt.%.

4.4 The appellant argued that from the mean degree of polymerization of 2.9, a homologous distribution for the (poly)glycerol can be inferred that corresponds to the distribution in claims 1 and 8, and in particular has a glycerol content of less than 20 wt.%. This was justified by stating that with a mean degree of polymerization of 2.9, the contained glycerol could only constitute more than 20 wt.% of the (poly)glycerol if the remaining 80 wt.% were almost exclusively formed by homologs composed of at least five glycerol units (pentaglycerols). However, such a homologous distribution, which has almost exclusively pentaglycerol and higher homologs alongside glycerol, is not to be expected in technical (poly)glycerols.

Furthermore, both the degree of polymerization of the (poly)glycerol of 2.9 and the hydroxyl number of 1180 indicated for the example of document E1 fall within the ranges preferred in the contested patent (paragraphs [0032] and [0034] as well as examples 1, 2, and 4). For the production of the starting material (poly)glycerol, the contested patent describes in paragraph [0032] the same method that is also described for its production in E1 (page 3, lines 25 to 26). Since this method leads to a (poly)glycerol used according to the contested patent, it must necessarily also be the case that the (poly)glycerol produced analogously in E1 has a corresponding homologous distribution.

Overall, it must therefore be assumed that the technical (poly)glycerol used in the manufacturing example of E1 has a glycerol content of less than 20 wt.%, and that therefore a homologous distribution according to claims 1 and 8 of the contested patent is present.

4.5 This argumentation is not convincing.

Even if the (poly)glycerol used in the manufacturing example of E1 has a mean degree of polymerization of 2.9 due to the indicated hydroxyl number of 1180, this does not allow for a conclusion about a specific homologous distribution, and thus not about a homologous distribution that corresponds to that required by the contested patent. While the appellant's submission in this regard is understandable, the mentioned degree of polymerization can correspond to a composition that may have a glycerol content of less than 20 wt.%. However, this content is not necessarily present, as compositions with higher homologs than pentaglycerol are also possible, which would then also allow for a higher glycerol content than 20 wt.%.

The respondent's submission is also credible that a composition merely referred to as technical (poly)glycerol, like that used in the manufacturing example of E1, cannot be attributed a specific homologous distribution without further information. The designation can also encompass compositions produced by different methods and possibly further blended or otherwise modified to set a desired degree of polymerization for a specific application. The document E1 itself already refers to the possibility of forming fractions with a desired degree of condensation by distilling technical (poly)glycerol mixtures (page 3, lines 25 to 27).

The appellant's reference to the manufacturing methods mentioned in the contested patent and in document E1 cannot close the disclosure gap of the manufacturing example from E1. First, it cannot be determined from the document by which method the technical (poly)glycerol used in the described example was produced. Rather, various possible methods for producing (poly)glycerols are mentioned in the document (page 3, lines 25 to 28). Furthermore, the document also refers to various (poly)glycerols (see page 3, lines 24 to 40). Thus, it cannot be assumed that the (poly)glycerol used in the manufacturing example has a homologous distribution as indicated in the table on page 3 of the document. Even if this were the case, a specific composition is also disclosed therein. Moreover, the table does not limit glycerol to a maximum content of 20 wt.%.

4.6 Since no (poly)glycerol is disclosed in the referenced manufacturing example of document E1 that has the homologous composition according to claims 1 and 8 of the main request, the objection of lack of novelty is not conclusive. In this regard, it is also not relevant whether the homologous distribution corresponds to that of the (poly)glycerol before (claim 8) or after (claim 1) the hydrolysis of the (poly)glycerol partial ester.

4.7 No separate objections were raised against the remaining independent claims. Since their subject matter refers back to the subject matter of claims 1 or 8, novelty is also to be recognized.

4.8 Therefore, the subject matter claimed in the present main request is novel over the disclosure of document E1. The request meets the requirements of Article 54 EPC.

5. Inventive Step (Article 100(a) and 56 EPC)

Closest Prior Art

5.1 The parties discussed inventive step solely based on document E1, particularly the manufacturing example on page 4. The Board also considers this disclosure to be a suitable starting point for assessing inventive step.

Distinguishing Feature

5.2 As explained above, the subject matter of claims 1 and 8 of the main request differs from the manufacturing example of document E1 by the claimed homologous distribution of the (poly)glycerol, namely in particular by the fact that the glycerol content is between 0.01 wt.% and 20 wt.%.

Technical Problem and Proposed Solution

5.3 The question of whether the distinguishing feature causes a technical effect, or what any potential technical effect consists of, was discussed by the parties with regard to the experiments described in document E12.

5.4 The respondent argued that the mentioned distinguishing feature leads to an improvement in the storage stability of O/W emulsions produced with the claimed (poly)glycerol partial esters. Thus, the technical problem consists of providing emulsifiers suitable for producing O/W emulsions with improved storage stability. This technical problem is solved by the (poly)glycerol partial esters having the claimed homologous distribution, and in particular a glycerol content of a maximum of 20 wt.%, as well as by the proportion of acid residues of the polyfunctional carboxylic acid being claimed to be between 0.005 and 0.5.

5.5 The appellant disagreed with this view. In its opinion, the experimental data disclosed in E12 do not allow for a comparison with the closest prior art, as they exhibit a variety of distinguishing features. Therefore, any technical effect cannot be attributed to a specific distinguishing feature, particularly not to the glycerol content. The objective technical problem solved is thus merely the provision of alternative (poly)glycerol partial esters.

5.6 The appellant's argumentation is not convincing.

5.6.1 According to the information in document E12, compositions are disclosed that are produced based on ""Example 2: Emulsifier 2"" of the contested patent from (poly)glycerols (E12, page 2, first paragraph of the experimental part). In contrast, they have a hydroxyl number of 1223 (Experiments 1 and 3) or 1113 (Experiments 2 and 4) instead of 1120 according to Example 2. They are apparently (poly)glycerol partial esters that contain 1.78 equivalents of stearic acid per equivalent of (poly)glycerol (last column of the table on page 2 of E12). Both the acid and its molar proportion fall within the definition of the compounds of claims 1 and 8.

Furthermore, they contain 1.40 equivalents (Experiments 1 and 2) or 0.08 equivalents (Experiments 3 and 4) of citric acid (column 2 of the table on page 3 of E12). Although citric acid falls under the claimed definition of a polyfunctional acid, only the equivalent values of 0.08 indicated in Experiments 3 and 4 fall within the claimed range of 0.005 to 0.5.

Finally, the glycerol content is either 25 wt.% (Examples 1 and 3), thus outside the claimed range of 0.01 to 20 wt.%, or 7 wt.%, thus within this range (column 3 of the table on page 3 of E12).

Regarding the proportions of other homologs, the respondent argued that they fall within the claimed ranges. Although this was initially doubted by the appellant, the doubts raised were not substantiated. Thus, it must be assumed that the homologous distribution of the (poly)glycerol, except for the individually mentioned glycerol content, lies within the distribution of claims 1 and 8.

5.6.2 Therefore, Experiment 4 is compliant with the claims, whereas Experiments 1 to 3 fall outside the claims because they either have too high a proportion of citric acid (1.40 in Experiment 2), or too high a glycerol content (25 wt.% in Experiment 3), or both (Experiment 1). There was agreement between the parties on this point.

5.6.3 Experiments 1 to 4 of document E12 differ from the manufacturing example according to E1, in addition to the glycerol content (25 and 7 wt.% versus no specification), in the nature of the acids (citric acid instead of dimer acid, stearic acid instead of isostearic acid), by the equivalents of the acid residues (1.40 and 0.08 instead of 0.44 and 1.78 instead of 2.21), the hydroxyl number (1223 and 1113 instead of 1180), and thus also in the degree of polymerization. The parties did not have differing opinions on this either.

5.6.4 However, it was disputed between the parties whether document E12, despite these differences, is suitable to demonstrate a technical effect caused by the distinguishing feature of the homologous distribution, in particular the glycerol content.

5.6.5 This is, as shown below, the case.

A comparison of Experiments 3 and 4 of document E12 shows that the use of a claim-compliant (poly)glycerol partial ester (Experiment 4, glycerol content 7 wt.% and citric acid content 0.08) leads to improved emulsion stability of a cream produced therewith (page 3, lower table, ""Experiment 3"" compared to ""Emulsifier 2 = Experiment 4"", last column). Although the two experiments also differ in hydroxyl number (Experiment 4: 1113 compared to Experiment 3: 1223), this is consistent with the different glycerol content. Moreover, the hydroxyl number is not a claim feature. Thus, this comparison demonstrates that the differing glycerol content in the compositions considered alone leads to an improvement in the emulsion stability of a cream produced from (poly)glycerol partial esters, with the remaining features lying within the limits of claim 1. This is particularly true for the citric acid content of 0.08.

From Experiment 2 of document E12, it follows that a (poly)glycerol partial ester with a citric acid content outside the claimed range (1.40 instead of 0.005 to 0.5) was not processed into a stable cream even when the glycerol content was within the claimed range, as in Experiment 4 (7 wt.% in Experiments 2 and 4).

From Experiment 1, it is evident that the use of a (poly)glycerol partial ester, which is outside the claimed ranges both in the proportion of citric acid (1.40) and in the glycerol content (25 wt.%), does not lead to a stable cream.

The overall consideration of Experiments 1 to 4 thus shows that a (poly)glycerol partial ester was processed into a stable cream when the glycerol content was initially within the claimed range of the homologous distribution. It also shows that the formation of a stable cream is only achieved when the proportion of citric acid is also within the range specified for a polyfunctional carboxylic acid.

5.6.6 These conclusions can also be transferred to a comparison with the closest prior art.

In the absence of contrary evidence, it can be assumed that essentially all (poly)glycerol partial esters falling under claims 1 and 8 exhibit comparable properties with respect to the technical problem to be solved.

The manufacturing example according to E1 is both in terms of the nature of the acids contained and in terms of their proportions within the definitions of the respective features of claims 1 and 8 of the main request. For such compositions, the influence of the glycerol content has been shown using E12. Thus, it is credible that the technical effect shown by the examples ""Experiment 1"" to ""Experiment 4"" of document E12 also occurs with respect to compositions according to E1, whose remaining features also lie within the claimed definitions. The Board therefore acknowledges that the distinguishing feature over E1 is associated with a technical effect, namely that a glycerol content within the claimed range, while simultaneously adhering to the proportion of polyfunctional carboxylic acid, leads to an improvement in the stability of a cream produced with the composition.

5.7 Thus, the technical problem can be seen, in accordance with the problem defined in paragraph [0010] of the contested patent, as providing (poly)glycerol partial esters whose use in the formulation of O/W emulsions leads to an improvement in emulsion stability.

5.8 The solution to the posed problem lies in providing (poly)glycerol partial esters that have a claimed homologous distribution, namely in particular with a glycerol content of 0.01 wt.% to 20 wt.%, as well as in providing a process according to claim 8.

Assessment of the Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

5.9 The appellant has argued regarding the obviousness of the claimed subject matter solely based on the solution to the technical problem of providing an alternative, and justified an obviousness by stating that the claimed subject matter merely represents a selection from the broader disclosure of document E1 with respect to the claimed ranges.

Considering the aforementioned technical problem, however, the proposed solution is not to be regarded as obvious. Document E1 contains no hint towards the specific, particularly narrower homologous distribution, especially with regard to the glycerol content. This is even more true considering the associated improved emulsion stability.

5.10 Thus, the skilled person is not led to the claimed (poly)glycerol partial esters or the process according to claim 8 based on the disclosure of document E1, taking into account the solved technical problem. The subject matter of claims 1 and 8 of the granted patent and the present main request therefore also involves an inventive step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC.

5.11 No additional aspects were raised by the parties regarding the remaining independent claims. Since these claims refer to the (poly)glycerol partial esters according to claim 1 or the production of the (poly)glycerol partial esters according to claim 8, inventive step is also to be recognized for them (Article 56 EPC).

6. In summary, it can thus be stated that none of the reasons presented by the appellant against the patentability of the main request can prevail. The decision of the opposition division therefore stands.

Further Requests

7. Since none of the reasons presented against the maintenance of the patent in the granted form speak against it, and therefore the main request of the respondent for the dismissal of the appeal is to be granted, both the auxiliary requests 1 to 5 submitted by the respondent and its request for referral of the matter can remain unconsidered.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",opposition rejected,opposition rejected,appeal dismissed,Clariant Produkte (Deutschland) GmbH,Clariant Produkte (Deutschland) GmbH Brüningstrasse 50 65926 Frankfurt am Main / DE,"Rippel, Hans Christoph Patentanwälte Isenbruck Bösl Hörschler PartG mbB Eastsite One Seckenheimer Landstrasse 4 68163 Mannheim / DE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeal of the appellant (opponent) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to maintain the patent EP 2 751 073 in amended form under Article 101(3)(a) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged on the basis of Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC) and lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC), as well as Article 100(b) EPC for insufficient disclosure.

IV. In its decision, the opposition division held that the invention claimed in the main request (granted patent) is sufficiently disclosed (Article 83 EPC). Furthermore, the claimed subject matter is novel (Article 54 EPC). However, the presence of an inventive step was denied, inter alia, based on the technical teaching of document D5 (Article 56 EPC).

The first auxiliary request before it was considered by the opposition division to meet the requirements of Rule 80 EPC as well as Articles 84 and 123(2) EPC. The claimed method was also found to be novel (Article 54 EPC), but for the reasons stated for the main request, it also did not involve an inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

Auxiliary request 2 also met the requirements of Rule 80 EPC as well as Articles 84 and 123(2) EPC. The method claimed therein was also novel (Article 54 EPC). It was also based on an inventive step in the sense of Article 56 EPC, starting from the respective disclosures of documents D5, D11, and D12.

V. Appeals were filed against this decision by both the patent owner and the opponent. The opponent (appellant) has substantiated its appeal in a timely manner. The patent owner (respondent) withdrew its appeal filed on May 20, 2019, on July 16, 2019.

VI. In response to the appellant's statement of grounds of appeal, the respondent presented arguments regarding the allowability of the requests made with the response and resubmitted the document ""Annex 1"" already submitted in the opposition proceedings.

VII. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the Board communicated its preliminary opinion to the parties regarding the main request of the patent owner (auxiliary request 2 of the opposition proceedings), on the basis of which the contested patent was maintained by the opposition division. The Board expressed the preliminary view that the claimed method is disclosed in a manner sufficient for it to be carried out (Article 83 EPC), and that it would not be obvious to the skilled person, regardless of the choice of one of documents D5, D11, and D12 as the closest prior art (Article 56 EPC).

VIII. The appellant responded to the Board's preliminary opinion with a further submission containing arguments on the issue of inventive step and regarding the auxiliary requests submitted by the respondent.

IX. An oral hearing took place on April 12, 2022, in the form of a video conference.

X. The present main request of the patent owner (auxiliary request 2 of the opposition proceedings) contains an independent claim with the following wording:

""1. A method for producing isocyanates by reacting the corresponding amines contained in at least one feed stream A with phosgene contained in at least one feed stream P in a reactor installation comprising at least one mixing zone and at least one reaction zone, wherein feed stream A and/or feed stream P may contain one or more inert substances, and

wherein during periods of at least 6 hours, in which the mass flow S**(x) of the amines used is below 95% of the mass flow S° of the amines used when operating at the nominal capacity of the reactor installation, compared to operation at the nominal capacity of the reactor

(i) the ratio of phosgene to amine is increased, and

(ii) the concentration of the inert substance or substances in the amine-containing feed stream A and/or the phosgene-containing feed stream P is increased.""

XI. In her statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

The decision of the opposition division regarding the auxiliary request 2 before it is erroneous, as the claimed subject matter is neither sufficiently disclosed (Article 83 EPC) nor based on an inventive step (Article 56 EPC), regardless of which of documents D5, D11, or D12 is used as the closest prior art. The objective technical problem solved is merely seen in providing an alternative method for the phosgenation of amines for the production of isocyanates compared to the prior art. The comparative examples cited are not significant and therefore should not be considered in formulating the technical problem.

XII. In her response to the appeal and in the further proceedings, the respondent essentially argued as follows:

The assessment of the points concerning sufficient disclosure and inventive step by the opposition division regarding the auxiliary request 2 before it is correct. In particular, the subject matter of claim 1 is not suggested to the skilled person starting from the documents D5, D11, and D12, which were again cited by the appellant. The examples contained in the contested patent itself, as well as the further experiments already submitted with Annex 1 in the opposition proceedings, particularly demonstrate that the distinguishing features regarding the disclosure of document D5 achieve an unexpected improvement in the known phosgenation process. Therefore, an inventive step is present. Even if the technical problem solved compared to the disclosure of document D12 is merely seen in providing an alternative, the claimed solution is also not obvious to the skilled person starting from this document.

XIII. Requests of the Parties

The appellant (opponent) requests the annulment of the contested decision, the revocation of European patent No. 2 751 073, and the admission of documents D16 and D17 into the proceedings.

The respondent (patent owner) requests the dismissal of the appeal and the maintenance of the patent on the basis of auxiliary request 2 (main request), or alternatively the maintenance of the patent in amended form on the basis of auxiliary requests 3, 5, and 6 submitted on December 7, 2018, in the opposition proceedings, as well as the non-admission of documents D16 and D17 into the proceedings.","Reasons for the Decision

Main Request of the Respondent - Auxiliary Request 2 of the Opposition Proceedings

1. Sufficiency of Disclosure (Article 83 EPC)

1.1 In its decision, the Opposition Division initially discussed the issue of sufficiency of disclosure with respect to the main request (granted patent) before it. It concluded that the contested patent disclosed the invention in such a clear and complete manner that a person skilled in the art could carry it out. Since there were no further objections from the Opponent regarding the Auxiliary Request 2 of the appeal proceedings also before it, its assessment applied equally to this request.

1.2 The Appellant disagreed with this view. It argued in particular that the skilled person would not be able to assess whether the claimed method was executable over the entire claimed breadth without extensive use of their general knowledge. Rather, the method was defined so broadly due to the parameters used that a research program would first need to be conducted to determine its feasibility. The Appellant specifically referred to the lack of information regarding the amines to be used, the amounts or flow rates of the starting materials or their ratios, as well as the process parameters. It further argued that the claim also required that the method could be carried out in both gas and liquid phases. However, the patent only described an example of a liquid phase process. Neither this process nor any other of the processes described in the contested patent fell under the method according to claim 1.

1.3 The Appellant's submissions do not establish a lack of sufficient disclosure.

The present claim 1 relates to a method for producing isocyanates. In this process, amines are reacted with phosgene. Although, as pointed out by the Appellant, neither the amines used nor the flow rates of the compounds employed are specified in the claim, information on this can be found in the description, for example regarding suitable amines (see paragraphs [0085] to [0088]). Additionally, as the Respondent pointed out, the description mentions process parameters under which the claimed method can be carried out. Furthermore, examples are described in the description of the contested patent that can serve as a basis for the skilled person to carry out the claimed methods (see paragraphs [0090] to [0093]).

The Appellant did not explain why the skilled person would not be able to modify, for example, the method described in paragraph [0093] such that the ratio of phosgene to amine is increased compared to the embodiment of the previously described examples, nor which specific embodiments the skilled person would not be able to execute.

It was also not explained what specific problems the skilled person would encounter when attempting to carry out the claimed method, or why they would not have sufficient information from the patent itself and with the aid of their general knowledge to solve any potential problems that might arise.

In the Chamber's view, it was therefore not convincingly demonstrated that the skilled person is unable to carry out the claimed method over the entire claimed breadth.

1.4 The Chamber therefore agrees with the assessment of the Opposition Division and the Respondent regarding the sufficiency of disclosure of the claimed method. The request meets the requirements of Article 83 EPC.

2. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

2.1 The Opposition Division acknowledged the presence of an inventive step. It justified this based on the methods disclosed in documents D5, D11, or D12 as possible closest prior art. It identified a distinguishing feature between the claimed method and the respective methods of the prior art in the measures mentioned under (i) and/or (ii) of the claim according to the present request (feature (i) compared to the methods disclosed in documents D5 or D11, feature (ii) compared to the methods disclosed in documents D12 or D11). The Opposition Division saw the technical problem solved as providing alternative methods (compared to D5 and D12) or providing an improved method (compared to D11). It partially based its reasoning on ""Annex 1,"" which was submitted by the patent holder (Respondent) in response to the opposition statement. This annex describes phosgenation methods.

2.2 The Appellant disagreed with this assessment by the Opposition Division. In its view, the presence of an inventive step was not given, based on any of the three mentioned documents.

2.3 The Chamber, in agreement with the Opposition Division and the Respondent, holds that the provision of the claimed method is based on an inventive step. The reasons for this are as follows:

2.3.1 The claimed invention

The contested patent relates to a method for producing isocyanates by reacting the corresponding amines with phosgene, specifically at an operation below the nominal capacity of the reactor used (see paragraphs [0001], [0010], and [0011] of the description). According to the contested patent, the problem with such a reaction below the nominal capacity is that the plants used are designed and optimized for a specific nominal capacity due to special requirements, such as rapid mixing of the reactant streams and narrow residence time windows of the reaction mixture in the reaction chambers. When operating below their nominal capacity, a plant does not operate in the optimal range, leading to yield losses, fouling problems, and/or quality degradation. Against this background, a method was to be provided in which, at different load levels, particularly in the partial load range, the mixing of the starting materials and/or their reaction with each other occurs within the respectively optimized residence time window (paragraphs [0010] and [0011]).

2.3.2 Closest Prior Art

The Appellant initially referred to documents D5, D11, and D12 as potential closest prior art, as already done in the opposition proceedings. During the oral proceedings, it conceded that document D11 was less suitable as a starting point for assessing inventive step. Therefore, it did not pursue its initially presented argumentation during the oral proceedings.

Regarding documents D5 and D12, the Appellant referred to Example 3 (document D5) and Examples 4 and 5 (document D12). From these examples, it can be inferred that a plant used in the respective documents is operated with different starting streams of amines. Thus, the mentioned examples either describe operation at nominal load or partial load operation.

In the Chamber's view, documents that deal with the production of isocyanates by reacting the corresponding amines with phosgene are generally suitable as closest prior art. This is the case for both of the documents ultimately discussed regarding inventive step (D5: Example 3, D12: Examples 3 and 4). However, suitable documents should also ideally address the problem posed by the contested patent, namely the task of providing a method that can avoid problems occurring particularly in the partial load range of the plant used.

However, this is not addressed in any of the mentioned documents.

Documents D5 and D12 do not explicitly disclose the execution of the methods below the nominal load of the plants used, nor do they refer to associated problems. Although, as pointed out by the Appellant with reference to the aforementioned examples, methods are disclosed that are apparently realized on the same plants and where different amounts of amine are supplied, no connection is established between the various methods described therein. In particular, neither of the two documents addresses whether and, if so, what conclusions the skilled person should draw from a possible comparison of the respective examples.

For the reasons stated above, the two mentioned documents are only conditionally suitable for assessing inventive step. In the absence of better-suited documents, however, they can be considered as a possible closest prior art following the Appellant's argumentation. As will be explained below, the subject matter of the claim is not suggested to the skilled person from any of the documents.

A. Document D5 as Closest Prior Art

2.3.3 D5 - Distinguishing Features

2.3.3.1 Document D5 discloses in Example 3 two variants of a method for producing an isocyanate (column 9, line 10: ""toluene diisocyanate"") by reacting the corresponding amine (column 8, line 72: ""2,4-tolylenediamine"") with phosgene (column 8, line 74). The variants are carried out in the same plant (see lines 72 to 74 of column 8 and lines 30 to 50 of column 7).

2.3.3.2 Initially, one variant of the method is described, in which the reactor is supplied with 65.3 parts of phosgene per hour and 15.5 parts of amine in 253 parts of inert material (o-dichlorobenzene as solvent) per hour. The ratio of phosgene to amine is thus 4.2 (65.3:15.5), and the concentration of the inert material in the amine is 16.3 (253:15.5) (column 8, line 72 to column 9, line 10).

2.3.3.3 In another variant, the reactor is supplied with 120.5 parts of phosgene per hour and 28.6 parts of amine in 253 parts of inert material (o-dichlorobenzene as solvent) per hour. The ratio of phosgene to amine is thus also 4.2 (120.5:28.6). However, the concentration of the inert material in the amine in this case is only 8.8 (253:28.6) (column 8, line 72 to column 9, line 10).

2.3.3.4 The two variants disclosed in Example 3 of document D5 thus differ initially in that in the first variant significantly less amine is used per hour than in the second variant (15.5 parts compared to 28.6 parts). From this, the Appellant concluded that the first variant describes a method under partial load, while the second describes a method in which the plant is operated at its nominal capacity. This view was undisputed between the parties.

It was also undisputed that the ratio of phosgene to amine is the same in both variants (4.2 - see preceding paragraphs), as well as that the variants differ in the concentration of the inert material in the amine-containing feed stream, with this concentration being higher in the ""partial load"" operation compared to the ""nominal capacity"" version (16.3 compared to 8.8 - see preceding paragraphs). Feature (ii) of the claimed method is thus fulfilled when comparing the two execution variants.

2.3.3.5 From the above considerations, the parties jointly concluded that the method claimed in the present main request differs from the method of Example 3 from document D5 on the one hand in that when operating below the nominal capacity of a reactor, the ratio of phosgene to amine is increased compared to operation at nominal capacity (feature (i) in claim 1). On the other hand, document D5 does not disclose that the measures mentioned in (i) and (ii) of claim 1 are carried out ""in periods of at least 6 hours, in which the flow rate S**(x) of the amines used is below 95% of the flow rate S**(0) of the amines used at operation at the nominal capacity of the reactor."" This was also undisputed between the parties.

2.3.4 D5 - Technical Problem

2.3.4.1 There was also agreement between the parties that the feature relating to the period of 6 hours does not lead to a verifiable technical effect.

2.3.4.2 However, the parties held differing views regarding the technical effect caused by the feature concerning the change in the ratio of phosgene to amine. While the Appellant argued that this feature does not produce any discernible technical effect, the Respondent argued that an increase in the ratio of phosgene to amine when transitioning from a nominal capacity operation to a partial load operation would lead to the avoidance of yield loss. It referred to the examples in the contested patent as well as the examples described in document ""Annex 1.""

2.3.4.3 The Respondent's argument is convincing for the following reasons:

In ""Comparative Example 1"" of the contested patent, a method is described in which toluene diisocyanate (TDI) is produced by phosgenation of toluene diamine (TDA) in a plant operating at nominal capacity (paragraph [0090]). The concentration of the amine (TDA) in the inert material (monochlorobenzene) is 30 wt.%, thus the concentration of the inert material in the amine-containing product stream is 70%. The ratio of phosgene to amine is 10. The yield of TDA achieved by the described method is 93.4% (paragraph [0091]).

According to ""Comparative Example 2"" of the contested patent, both the amine and phosgene-containing feed streams are halved to operate the plant below its nominal capacity, namely at 50%. As a result, the yield of TDA compared to ""Comparative Example 1"" drops from 93.4% to 80.2% (paragraph [0092]).

The method referred to in Annex 1 as ""Inventive Example 2"" shows that - starting from the plant operated at below 50% of its nominal load in Comparative Example 2 of the contested patent - an increase in the ratio of phosgene to amine from 10 (contested patent, Comparative Example 2) to 18.4 (Annex 1, Inventive Example 2) leads to an increase in yield to 93.4%, thus to the value obtained at nominal capacity (paragraph [0091]).

Thus, the comparison of the methods according to ""Comparative Example 2"" (paragraph [0092] of the description) and ""Inventive Example 2"" (Annex 1) with ""Comparative Example 1"" (paragraph [0090] of the description) allows the conclusion that in the examined phosgenation method, a reduction in yield can be avoided when, with a reduction in the capacity of a plant initially associated with an equal reduction of both feed streams, the ratio of phosgene to amine is increased. The aforementioned distinguishing feature from the method according to document D5, Example 3 (feature (i) of claim 1, see point 2.3.3 of this decision) thus leads to a reduction in yield loss in a method operated below the nominal capacity of the plant.

2.3.4.4 The Appellant argued that this claimed technical effect could already be achieved by the sole measure of increasing the concentration of the inert material in the amine-containing feed stream. Therefore, the mentioned distinguishing feature could not be attributed any technical effect. It specifically referred to the method referred to as ""Inventive Example 1"" of the contested patent (paragraph [0093] of the description).

2.3.4.5 Indeed, it is evident from the method ""Inventive Example 1"" cited by the Appellant that the technical effect explained in point 2.3.4.3 of this decision can also be achieved alternatively from ""Comparative Example 2"" (paragraph [0092] of the description) by the feature mentioned in (ii) of claim 1. An increase in the amount of the inert medium monochlorobenzene in the amine-containing feed stream from 70% (""Comparative Example 1"" and ""Comparative Example 2"") to 82% (""Inventive Example 1,"" where the concentration of toluene diamine in monochlorobenzene is only 18 wt.%) also leads to a yield increase back to 93.4%. However, this does not cast doubt on the fact that the said effect is also caused by feature (i) of claim 1, as explained above.

2.3.4.6 Furthermore, the method referred to in Annex 1 as ""Inventive Example 3"" demonstrated that measure (i) - i.e., the distinguishing feature from the closest prior art of Example 3 from document D5 - also produces a technical effect when measure (ii) is also taken. In the mentioned example, starting from the method of ""Comparative Example 2,"" both the ratio of phosgene to amine is increased, namely from 10 to 12.6 (measure (i) of claim 1), and the concentration of the inert material in the amine-containing feed stream is increased, namely from 70% to 74.6% - the concentration of the amine in monochlorobenzene is 25.4% (measure (ii) of claim 1). The yield achieved is again 93.4%. Considering the yield of 93.4% obtained according to ""Inventive Example 3"" - with an increase in the concentration of the inert material in the amine-containing product stream from 70% to 82%, a lesser yield increase would be expected if only the concentration were increased from 70% to 74.6%. Therefore, the actual observed yield improvement must also have been caused by the increase in the ratio of phosgene to amine.

2.3.4.7 From the overall view of the mentioned examples, it can therefore be concluded that the first aforementioned distinguishing feature from the closest prior art Example 3 of document D5, namely that according to feature (i) of claim 1 ""the ratio of phosgene to amine is increased,"" can avoid or at least reduce yield loss. This effect occurs both when no further measures are taken (see point 2.3.4.3 of this decision) and when, in partial load operation compared to operation at nominal capacity, the concentration of the inert material in the amine-containing feed stream is increased (see point 2.3.4.6 of this decision).

2.3.4.8 The Appellant also argued that neither the first example of Annex 1 nor the example in paragraph [0093] of the description of the contested patent are inventive. In each case, only one of the two features (i) and (ii) is realized. In contrast, both measures are to be applied together according to the claim. Even if this is true, which was not disputed by the Respondent, the examples cited can demonstrate a technical effect caused by the distinguishing feature (feature (i) of the claim) compared to the disclosure from document D5, as explained above.

2.3.4.9 The Appellant further argued that the examples cited do not represent actually carried out methods but are merely based on calculations by the Respondent. This is already evident from the description of the contested patent (paragraph [0089]). However, calculations may be associated with inaccuracies, and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution.

The Respondent confirmed during the oral proceedings before the Chamber that the methods described in the examples represent the result of calculations, which, however, were based on data such as flow rates and mixing times from real processes. Therefore, the results are reliable and meaningful.

The Chamber sees no reason why the mentioned examples should not be used for the question of possible technical effects. Initially, the Respondent only raised concerns, but no plausible arguments that would lead to disregarding the experimental results. Furthermore, there was agreement between the parties that especially in large-scale processes, simulations are routinely performed, and their results are taken into account for the planning of the processes to be carried out.

2.3.4.10 The Appellant also argued that any technical effect was at least not demonstrated over the entire claimed breadth. In its view, the claim wording, for example, also encompasses embodiments where, on the one hand, the ratio of phosgene to amine is increased, but on the other hand, the claim wording does not exclude that simultaneously, for example, the concentration of the inert material in the amine-containing feed stream is decreased. This would compensate for the respective opposing partial effects, and as a result, an overall effect in the form of reduced yield losses would not be achievable.

2.3.4.11 The Chamber does not find this argumentation compelling. The claimed method is defined by features that must be carried out to realize the method. Even if additional features or process steps are not explicitly excluded, the present claim cannot be interpreted in such a way that it also contains any other arbitrary features in addition to the specified features. This is particularly true when, as argued by the Respondent in this case, no relevant indications can be derived from the entirety of the contested patent.

2.3.4.12 In summary, the objective technical problem that was indeed solved can be seen as reducing the associated decrease in yield of isocyanates in a reactor operated under partial load and the thereby reduced amount of amine supplied.

2.3.5 D5 - Proposed Solution

The mentioned technical problem is solved according to the claim by feature (i), namely by increasing the ratio of phosgene to amine.

2.3.6 D5 - Non-Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

2.3.6.1 The Appellant argued that the skilled person would already derive from document D5 itself that the method described in Example 3 could be modified by increasing the ratio of phosgene to amine. It specifically referred to lines 12 to 20 of column 4 of the document. There, the skilled person is suggested to increase the proportion of phosgene. The skilled person would also systematically change the process conditions through routine procedures and would therefore automatically arrive at the claimed measures. They would thus also go beyond the proportion of phosgene to amine disclosed in Example 3. This measure is also suggested to the skilled person in document D12 (column 3, lines 27 to 33). The Appellant held the view that the skilled person would increase the ratio of phosgene to amine in particular in the first-mentioned method of Example 3, i.e., in the method under reduced reactor load. This example alone should be considered as the closest prior art, as no two-stage method is claimed in the considered request.

2.3.6.2 The Chamber is not convinced by the Appellant's submissions.

First, when assessing the obviousness of the measures taken compared to the closest prior art, the objective technical problem must be considered. In the present case, the question arises as to whether the skilled person would receive a suggestion from the cited prior art to modify the teaching of document D5 in a way that leads to a method in which, in partial load operation - i.e., under reduced amine supply - a yield loss of the produced isocyanate can be reduced. In the Chamber's view, this is not the case here.

The Respondent argued that when reducing the load of a phosgenation plant over a certain period - as claimed, at least 6 hours - the amount of phosgene supplied is also proportionally reduced with the reduction of the supplied amine. This leads, among other things, to avoiding the need to recover unreacted phosgene and the associated risks of excess phosgene in the plant. Therefore, the ratio of phosgene to amine does not initially change. The Chamber finds this argument plausible.

While it is true, as pointed out by the Appellant, that both in document D5 itself (column 4, lines 12 to 20) and in document D12 (column 3, lines 27 to 33) it is stated that phosgene can be used in excess relative to amine, this would initially lead to this measure being taken in both of the process variants described in Example 3. However, this does not change the ratio of phosgene to amine of a method under partial load compared to a method operated at the nominal capacity of a reactor. This is precisely what is required in the claim. While the Appellant also argued that the skilled person would only take the measure in the first of the two described methods, this was not supported by further explanations. The Chamber does not find this convincing either.

Therefore, the mentioned passages of documents D5 and D12 do not already provide the skilled person with a hint to increase the ratio of phosgene to amine with the reduction of the plant load. Even less can a hint be derived from the mentioned passages to take this measure concerning the technical problem mentioned, which is solved by the claimed approach.

2.3.7 Thus, the claimed method is not suggested to the skilled person based on the technical teaching of document D5, regardless of the consideration of the further distinguishing feature relating to the period of 6 hours (see point 2.3.3.5 of this decision).

B. Document D12 as Closest Prior Art

2.3.8 D12 - Distinguishing Feature

2.3.8.1 In connection with inventive step, the parties referred to Examples 3 and 4 of document D12. In these examples, a method for producing an isocyanate (1,6-diisocyanatohexane) by reacting phosgene with the corresponding amine (1,6-diaminohexane) is also described. In Example 4, 54 kg/h of amine (as a 16.8% amine solution in o-dichlorobenzene as solvent) are supplied, while in Example 3 only 40 kg/h (as a 17.8% solution in o-dichlorobenzene as solvent) are supplied. There was agreement between the parties that Example 4 can thus be regarded as a method at the nominal capacity of the reactor used, while Example 3 is regarded as a method carried out under partial load of the reactor.

2.3.8.2 It was undisputed between the parties that in partial load operation (Example 3), the ratio of phosgene to amine is higher compared to the method at assumed nominal capacity (Example 4), taking into account the respective concentrations. Feature (i) of the present claim is therefore also fulfilled in the method according to document D12.

2.3.8.3 It was also undisputed that in the method under partial load (Example 3), less solvent is used compared to the method at assumed nominal capacity (Example 4), both in the phosgene-containing and in the amine-containing feed stream. Thus, the concentration of phosgene in o-dichlorobenzene in Example 3 is 61.7%, while in Example 4 it is only 43.9%; the concentrations of the inert material (solvent) in the phosgene-containing product stream are thus about 38% in Example 3 and 56% in Example 4. Similarly, the concentration of the amine in Example 3 (partial load) is higher at 17.8% than in Example 4 (nominal capacity), thus the respective concentrations of the inert material are lower in partial load operation. This contradicts feature (ii) of the claimed method, as in one of the claimed possibilities, the concentration of the inert material in the phosgene and/or amine-containing feed stream is increased.

2.3.8.4 Furthermore, it was undisputed that the feature ""in periods of at least 6 hours,"" as compared to the disclosure of document D5, represents another distinguishing feature.

2.3.9 D12 - Technical Problem

Both parties agreed that the objective technical problem to be defined concerning the disclosure of document D12 is to provide an alternative method for producing isocyanates by phosgenation of the corresponding amines. The Chamber also considers this definition to be correct.

2.3.10 D12 - Proposed Solution

Both parties stated that to solve the stated problem, it is proposed according to the claim that ""(ii) the concentration of the inert material or inert materials in the amine-containing feed stream A and/or the phosgene-containing feed stream P is increased."" The Chamber also agrees with this consideration.

2.3.11 D12 - Non-Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

To support its argument regarding the obviousness of the proposed solution, the Appellant referred not only to document D12 itself but also to document D9. From both documents, the skilled person would derive the technical teaching to add the amine possibly in a larger amount of solvent than used in Examples 3 and 4 of document D12. For example, document D12 describes in Example 1 an amine concentration of only 15%, thus a higher concentration of the inert material (85%) compared to Examples 3 and 4. In document D9, concentrations of a minimum of 2% amine in the solvent are proposed (column 2, lines 9 to 12 and lines 16 to 55), thus a significantly higher value of inert material than in the cited examples of document D12. Document D9 also indicates that with greater dilution, fewer by-products are to be expected. It is also to be assumed that the skilled person, in search of an improvement in yield of 96% in Example 3 of document D12, would consider a higher dilution of the supplied amine and thus an increase in the concentration of the inert material.

2.3.12 This argumentation is also not convincing. While it is true that various concentrations of the supplied feed streams are disclosed for the considered phosgenation reaction in the prior art, the skilled person does not derive from any of the cited passages to dilute the feed streams when transitioning from nominal load operation to partial load operation. A comparison of Examples 3 and 4 of document D12 describes precisely the opposite approach, as explained above. An increase in the concentration of the inert material in both methods of different reactor loads does not lead to the claimed solution of the technical problem, as in this case, the concentration of the inert material in partial load operation is increased compared to operation at nominal capacity.

2.3.13 Thus, the claimed method is also not suggested to the skilled person based on the technical teaching of document D12.

2.4 The Appellant's submissions are therefore not suitable to demonstrate a lack of inventive step. The present main request thus meets the requirements of Article 56 EPC, and the corresponding decision of the Opposition Division therefore stands.

Further Requests

3. Since the main request of the Respondent - the dismissal of the appeal - is granted, its auxiliary requests, namely the maintenance based on one of auxiliary requests 3, 5, and 6, can remain unconsidered.

Since the Appellant did not base its submissions in the appeal proceedings on documents D16 and D17, a decision on their admission into the proceedings is unnecessary.

4. In summary, it can therefore be stated that the patent based on the present main request of the Respondent - Auxiliary Request 2 of the opposition proceedings - meets the requirements of the EPC, particularly regarding sufficiency of disclosure in the sense of Article 83 EPC as well as the presence of an inventive step in the sense of Article 56 EPC. The decision challenged by the Opponent from the Opposition Division therefore stands.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,appeal dismissed,The Dow Chemical Company,"The Dow Chemical Company Intellectual Property 2030 Dow Center Abbott Road Midland, MI 48640 / US","Beck Greener LLP, et al, et al Fulwood House 12 Fulwood Place London WC1V 6HR / GB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. Both the appellant and the patent proprietor filed an appeal against the decision of the opposition division to maintain the contested patent in amended form under Article 101(3)(a) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged under Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty and lack of inventive step.

The opposition division concluded in the contested decision that the novelty of the claims of the granted patent was given. The ground for opposition of inventive step was admitted into the proceedings contrary to the objections of the patent proprietor. The opposition division considered the method defined in independent claim 1 of the granted patent, starting from D1, to be obvious to the skilled person. In the first auxiliary request underlying the opposition decision, this claim was deleted; independent claim 1 of this first auxiliary request corresponds to independent claim 2 of the granted patent. The method defined in this claim of the auxiliary request was deemed inventive by the opposition division. It therefore decided that the patent could be maintained on the basis of the first auxiliary request.

IV. The two independent claims 1 and 2 of the granted patent read as follows (the differences of claim 2 compared to claim 1 are highlighted by [deleted: deletion] and underlining):

Claim 1:

characterized in that

at least during the period t, only such a benzene-containing stream (a.1) is fed to the reactor that has a content of aliphatic organic compounds of less than 1.5 mass-%, based on the total mass of (a.1).""

Claim 2:

""Continuous process for the production of nitrobenzene by nitration of benzene, wherein

a) a benzene-containing stream (a.1) comprising at least 90 mass-% benzene, based on the total mass of (a.1), is reacted in a reactor with a mixture of sulfuric acid (a.2) and nitric acid (a.3) under adiabatic conditions, wherein benzene is used in a stoichiometric excess based on nitric acid (a.3), and wherein the amount M' of the benzene-containing stream (a.1) fed to the reactor per hour is increased within a period t from the start of nitration until a predetermined target value for M' is reached,

V. In her appeal statement and in the further proceedings, the appellant-opponent essentially argued regarding the two independent claims of the granted patent that the claimed process was already implicitly disclosed in D1. In particular, neither the target value M' nor the period t was defined in the claim, so that the claim features based on these parameters did not represent a difference to D1. Furthermore, common practices for starting up nitration processes led to the claimed processes. For the same reasons, the claimed processes also lacked inventive step. Specific advantages of the claimed processes were not demonstrated by the comparative tests in the patent.

VI. In her appeal statement and in the further proceedings, the appellant-patent proprietor essentially argued regarding the two independent claims of the granted patent that the claimed process, in particular the defined proportion of light boiling substances in the benzene used during the start-up phase, was neither implicitly nor explicitly described in D1. This feature led to a temporal and energetic optimization, which could not be derived from the prior art. Inventive step was therefore also present.

VII. Following the request of both parties, the board scheduled an oral hearing, which finally took place on July 11, 2023, after several postponements. A procedural ruling under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020 was issued on May 4, 2022.

VIII. The appellant-opponent requested to set aside the decision of the opposition division and revoke the patent. She also requested that the auxiliary requests of the patent proprietor not be admitted into the appeal proceedings. Furthermore, she requested that the statement made by the patent proprietor during the oral hearing before the Board regarding the duration of ""t"" be recorded in the minutes of the proceedings.

IX. The appellant-patent proprietor requested to set aside the decision of the opposition division and instead dismiss the opposition, i.e., to maintain the patent in the granted scope (main request). Alternatively, she requested the maintenance of the patent on the basis of auxiliary requests 1 to 3, submitted with the appeal statement, resubmitted with the response to the appeal, or on the basis of auxiliary request 4, which corresponds to the maintained version, or on the basis of auxiliary requests 5 and 6, submitted with the response to the appeal. Furthermore, she requested that documents D8 to D12 not be admitted into the appeal proceedings.

X. At the end of the oral hearing, the decision was announced.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Admission of Documents into the Proceedings

The admission of documents D8-D12 into the proceedings was contested by the patent holder.

The objection of the opponent based on the combination of D1 and D12 was, as indicated in the minutes of the proceedings, withdrawn during the oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal. Therefore, a decision on the admission of D12 is unnecessary.

D8-D10 were submitted by the opponent in the opposition proceedings to support the novelty objection based on D6. Since this objection was not pursued further in the appeal proceedings, these documents are irrelevant anyway.

D11 was not admitted into the proceedings by the opposition division. According to the reasoning of the decision, it was submitted too late and was also irrelevant, as it did not go beyond the content of D1, see point 2 of the contested decision. D11 is neither mentioned in the appeal brief nor in the opponent's response to the appeal, nor did the opponent refer to this document during the oral proceedings. Therefore, D11 is also irrelevant for the present decision.

Patent as Granted

3. The patent claims a continuous process for the adiabatic nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene.

Characteristic of the claimed process is that within a time period t from the start of nitration, only such benzene is supplied to the reaction that has a content of aliphatic compounds (light ends) of less than 1.5 mass-%.

In the process according to claim 1 of the granted version, benzene is already used from the beginning, which partially originates from the recycling of unconsumed benzene from the nitration (recycled benzene). In the process according to claim 2 of the granted version, this recycling is only started after the time t, i.e., until then fresh benzene (fresh benzene) is used.

The time period t is defined in the claim such that it extends from the start of nitration until a predetermined target value for M' is reached. M' is the amount of benzene supplied to the reactor per hour.

According to the description of the patent, see for example paragraph [0001], this period defines the start-up time, i.e., the time from the start of the process until the desired benzene feed in the steady-state target condition is reached.

4. Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

4.1 D1 discloses a continuous process for the adiabatic nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene. The process management as such corresponds to the patented process management. In other words, D1 discloses the continuous process that corresponds to the target state regarding the benzene feed of the currently claimed process after the start-up phase. This was undisputed.

4.1.1 The opponent particularly refers to paragraphs [0007] and [0017]. Paragraph [0007] describes that the light ends concentrate in the recycled benzene during the process, as they do not react in the nitration and are distilled off together with the excess feed benzene during the subsequent distillative purification of nitrobenzene. To keep the proportion of these compounds in the process within reasonable limits and not to circulate unnecessary unreactive material, it is proposed to divert a certain portion of the recycled benzene from the process and to reintroduce the remainder into the reaction as a reactant in a suitable ratio with fresh benzene. The light ends content of technical fresh benzene is stated to be between 0.01 and 0.5%. Paragraph [0017] provides a detailed explanation of the process exemplarily illustrated in Figure 1.

D1 describes the steady state of the process. In the steady state, fresh benzene and recycled benzene are mixed in such a way that the feed benzene contains a light ends content of 5%, see paragraph [0007]. The conditions during the start-up of the reaction are not explicitly addressed.

4.1.2 The opponent argued that the statements in paragraph [0017], which explain the process shown in Figure 1, explicitly disclose a start-up of the process with technical benzene. This is particularly clear from the passage ""Nitric acid in the concentration range between 50 and 68% HNO3 [1] and technical benzene [2] react in the reactor in the presence of sulfuric acid [3] (...)"", which describes the reaction with technical benzene, i.e., benzene with a light ends content of 0.01 to 0.5%.

The Board has doubts as to whether a start-up process is even described in paragraph [0017]. This paragraph rather describes the reactions, separation operations, and material flows during the steady state described in D1. The feed stream [15] to the reactor is referred to as a ""mixture of fresh benzene and recycled benzene.""

However, even if one were to follow the opponent's interpretation, it does not disclose that the light ends content in the feed benzene remains below the threshold defined in the claim during the start-up time, and not only at the beginning of the start-up. This is elaborated further below.

4.2 The opponent argued that D1 implicitly discloses the claimed start-up process.

4.2.1 First, in their view, the time period t mentioned in the claim is undefined and thus not suitable for distinguishing the claim from D1. They referred to paragraph [0019] of the patent, in which various starting amounts M' of benzene are defined, which are used at the beginning of the nitration to later achieve an amount M'Soll under target load. In their view, the starting and target values could be arbitrarily close together, so that the time t becomes arbitrarily short. A start-up of the D1 process with technical benzene with a light ends content of 0.01 to 0.5% would therefore automatically lead to a claimed process. After all, with arbitrarily short time periods t, it would be impossible to exceed the threshold of the light ends content of 1.5% during the time period t.

This argument is not convincing to the Board.

The starting point of the time period t is clearly defined, namely at the beginning of the nitration, i.e., at the start of the reaction. The endpoint of the time period t is given as soon as the benzene stream reaches a predetermined target load M'Soll.

It is true that claims 1 and 2 do not explicitly state either the time period t or the target load M'Soll. However, the skilled person understands the target load to be a plateau value of a steady state after the start-up of the reaction. The skilled person also knows that, as stated in paragraph [0019] of the patent, a continuously operated industrial process cannot be started up in arbitrarily short time. Typical start-up times, as confirmed by the patent holder during the oral proceedings, are in the range of a few hours; this statement by the patent holder was recorded in the minutes at the request of the opponent. A duration of a few hours for the start-up time is also evident from the examples of the contested patent.

A novelty-destroying process in the prior art would therefore have to maintain a light ends content in the feed benzene of less than 1.5 mass-% during a not arbitrarily short start-up time.

4.2.2 The opponent's main argument was that during the start-up of the process described in D1 with fresh benzene, the light ends content in the feed benzene only gradually increases, so that the threshold defined in the claim of 1.5 mass-% is automatically exceeded only after reaching the target load for the benzene feed. Since the process operates with technical benzene, which according to D1 contains between 0.01 and 0.5% light ends, at least at the beginning, the light ends concentration is within the claimed range. Such a start-up of this process has been simulated in document D2.

However, for an implicit disclosure of the claimed process in D1, it would be necessary that executing the teaching of D1 inevitably leads to a claimed procedure. It is not sufficient, as the opponent argues and attempts to demonstrate with D2, that it is possible to design the start-up process in D1 so that a claimed process results. However, the opponent has not demonstrated any inevitability.

4.2.3 In summary, the Board finds that D1 does not describe the start-up process. It is entirely conceivable that in D1 the process is started up with technical fresh benzene. It is also possible that the recycled benzene generated in D1 is either recycled from the beginning (claim 1 of the contested patent) or is only recycled into the process once the target load is reached (claim 2 of the contested patent). It is also conceivable that during certain procedures, the light ends content in the feed benzene remains below the claimed limit of 1.5%, as calculated in D2. However, all of this is not described in D1, nor has it been proven that this is a necessary consequence of the teaching disclosed in D1. Therefore, D1 does not contain an implicit disclosure of the claimed processes.

The arguments of the opposition division regarding novelty with respect to D1 in point 3.3.1 of the contested decision are to be agreed with in the result.

5. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

5.1 The patent holder contested that the opposition division was even allowed to address this ground of opposition. The ground of inventive step was not substantiated in the notice of opposition.

5.1.1 It is undisputed that in the notice of opposition, only novelty objections were substantiated against D1, and this was the case for all claims of the contested patent. In the form, both novelty and inventive step are checked under Article 100 a) EPC.

5.1.2 The opponent referred to the decision T 131/01 published in the Official Journal (OJ 2003, 115), which has also been confirmed in more recent case law (T 299/15, reasons 2.1). This case law has recently been questioned for certain circumstances, see T 1042/18. Ultimately, however, this case law is not relevant in the present case.

For an opposition division has the opportunity, based on the principle of ex officio examination laid down in Article 114 (1) EPC, to examine even unraised grounds of opposition, provided they prima facie seem to oppose the maintenance of the patent in whole or in part, see G 10/91, headnote 2. That the opposition division considered the ground of inventive step to be prima facie relevant is already evident from the fact that it maintained the patent only in a limited form based on this objection.

5.1.3 The Board therefore considers the approach of the opposition division, which examined the objections of lack of inventive step against D1 during the opposition proceedings, to be unobjectionable.

5.2 Closest Prior Art

5.2.1 D1 is undisputedly the closest prior art.

5.2.2 According to the above result of the novelty assessment, the independent claims of the contested patent differ from D1 in that ""at least during the time period t, only such a benzene-containing stream is supplied to the reactor that has a content of aliphatic organic compounds of less than 1.5 mass-%"" based on the total mass of the supplied benzene. This feature is present in both independent claims 1 and 2 of the patent.

In D1, a proportion of light ends of 5% is proposed for steady-state operation; no information is found for the start-up process.

5.3 Objective and Solution

5.3.1 According to the patent holder, the technical problem starting from D1 was to start the known process in such a way that as little energy as possible is consumed and the start-up time can be kept as short as possible. This problem is solved by the claimed limitation of the light ends content in the feed benzene to 1.5% during the start-up time.

They particularly refer to the table on page 9 of the patent. This table shows that the two examples corresponding to the two possibilities of independent claims 1 and 2 have a lower steam consumption and shorter start-up times than the comparative examples operating with a higher light ends content in the feed benzene.

5.3.2 The opposition division only partially adopted this view. In particular, it argued that the process in claim 1 also includes the possibility of starting the process exclusively with fresh benzene, which according to D1 contains a light ends content of only 0.01 to 0.5%. No advantages over D1 for this procedure have been demonstrated. A start-up of the D1 process with fresh benzene is, namely, obvious and can, according to the calculations in D2, lead to the light ends content increasing so slowly that it remains below the claimed limit during the entire start-up time.

The opponent defended this view and particularly emphasized that D2 works with realistic assumptions and therefore is a likely result of an obvious procedure.

5.3.3 The Board finds the argument that in the case of exclusively starting a process according to claim 1 with fresh benzene, claimed advantages over D1 have not been demonstrated, unconvincing.

First, it is clearly evident from the data in the table of the patent that with decreasing light ends content of the feed benzene during the start-up time t, the desired advantages in terms of energy consumption and start-up time are achieved. For the start-up with fresh benzene, this was shown in example 4 for the case where no recycled benzene is added during the start-up time. Example 3 shows the effects for the case of a light ends content of 1.5% in the feed benzene. Why this should no longer be the case when pure fresh benzene with a light ends content of 0.01 to 0.5% is used as feed benzene is neither immediately evident nor substantiated. Although the opponent has questioned the significance of this data, the Board is convinced that this was unsuccessful; this will be further explained below.

However, the opponent's argument that using fresh benzene for the start-up of the process described in D1 does not demonstrate any additional advantages for the present claims over D1 is misguided. It is based on the assumption that the skilled person would inevitably arrive at a claimed process with such a procedure because the light ends content in the feed benzene could not increase quickly enough. This assumption has already been discussed and rejected in the context of the novelty analysis. Such inevitability does not exist. This hypothetical embodiment is not directly and unambiguously derivable from the teaching of D1 and therefore cannot serve as a starting point for the assessment of inventive step or for formulating the objective technical problem to be posed in this context. D1 describes the steady state of the process. Based on this disclosure, the objective technical problem is to be posed, not based on hypothetical procedures not described in D1.

5.3.4 The opponent has questioned the significance of the data in the table. In their view, some of the parameters indicated are unclear or not specified. The patent holder has denied this.

The Board considers the inadequacies claimed by the opponent to be unproven. The indication ""excess benzene"" clearly refers to the amount of benzene used in relation to the nitric acid; this is essentially constant in the four examples. The indication ""recycled benzene"" refers to the aliphatic content in the recycled benzene, as indicated in the heading of the three middle columns. The essential indication, namely the light ends content in the feed benzene, is clearly stated.

The opponent has particularly argued that it is unclear whether the aliphatic content indicated in the table during the time t is an average value or refers to the state at the end of the start-up time. If this is an average value, then example 3 is not covered by the scope of the claim, as the value at the end of the start-up time would then be higher than defined in the claim. Therefore, example 3 cannot demonstrate any improvement over D1 for the process specified in claim 1.

However, the Board is of the opinion that, even if this were the case, the assessment of energy optimization by controlling the light ends content within the claimed range remains unchanged. The table shows that with decreasing light ends content in the feed benzene, energy consumption decreases during the start-up. In this respect, it is demonstrated that at least an effect exists below a threshold of 1.5% compared to the concentration of 5% proposed in D1. This was illustrated by comparative example 1, where with a light ends content of 4.4% in the feed benzene, the reaction does not start at all. If such an effect also exists just above the limit of 1.5%, it would not change anything.

The opponent also argued that the table and the resulting effects do not relate to the start-up time but to reaching the steady state of the reaction. However, it should be noted that the table clearly states the start-up time t, i.e., the time until the target load of benzene is reached.

Another argument from the opponent related to the absolute steam consumption. It was argued that this absolute value cannot necessarily be equated with lower or higher energy consumption during the start-up time. However, the Board does not see why a reduction in steam consumption correlating with the light ends content in the feed benzene, as indicated in Table 1, should not mean energy savings, regardless of which process step the steam is used for in detail.

The Board therefore sees no reason to doubt the significance of the data in Table 1.

5.3.5 The opponent further argued that the technical problem proposed by the patent holder is not justified, as the claimed process does not only relate to a start-up but generally to the nitration of benzene.

This argument is not convincing. In fact, the claims encompass a process as a whole. Nevertheless, the process is characterized by the manner of the start-up, so that a problem statement relating to this part of the process is permissible. As stated above, the Board also does not believe that the indication of the time t and the target value MSoll is meaningless.

5.3.6 The technical problem proposed by the patent holder starting from D1 is therefore correct. That this problem is solved by the solution defined in the claim, namely to limit the light ends content in the feed benzene during the start-up time to 1.5%, is also demonstrated.

5.4 Obviousness of the Solution to the Technical Problem

5.4.1 Finally, the question was to decide whether a skilled person, starting from the description of the steady-state process in D1 in search of an energetically and temporally optimized start-up process, would have limited the light ends content in the feed benzene during the start-up in the claimed manner.

5.4.2 D1 does not provide any suggestion for this. D1 does not deal with the start-up of the reaction. The opponent has also not referred to any other documents in the prior art that provide information about an energetically or otherwise optimized start-up of a benzene nitration. A skilled person could not even deduce from the cited prior art that starting the process with the light ends content proposed in D1 for steady-state operation of 5% in the feed benzene would be problematic. D1 does not see any problems with the reaction management itself in connection with the light ends content, but only with the separation of the crude nitrobenzene from the sulfuric acid to be recycled, which is to be counteracted by operating the sulfuric acid separator under pressure, see paragraphs [0008] and [0010].

Should the skilled person take the statements in paragraph [0007] of D1 as an opportunity to start the process with fresh benzene, they would be guided to dose the recycled benzene, which contains a light ends content of 20-50%, to the fresh benzene up to a light ends content of 5% in the feed benzene. They would not deduce from D1 or their own knowledge that a further limitation during the start-up time is advantageous.

5.4.3 The opponent's main argument was also that a procedure they consider common, namely using only fresh benzene in the start-up phase (for example, because no recycled benzene is available), would lead to a claimed process according to the simulations in D2. Thus, the skilled person would have unconsciously received the achieved energetic and temporal advantages.

It is true that the skilled person, when reading D1, could also think about how to start the continuous process described there, independently of optimization issues.

If they were to start the process with fresh benzene, it is apparently possible, as calculated by the opponent in D2, that under certain conditions no further measures need to be taken to keep the light ends content in the feed benzene below the claimed limit during the start-up time. However, this is not inevitable, as explained above in the novelty discussion. Therefore, it cannot be said, as the opponent has argued, that the claimed invention would have fallen into the lap of the skilled person starting from D1.

Moreover, such reasoning does not correspond to a targeted approach of the skilled person in search of a solution to the technical problem posed. For a denial of inventive step, it is not sufficient that the skilled person might arrive at the subject matter of the claim by modifying the prior art. According to the established case law of the Boards of Appeal, it is, on the contrary, important whether they would have proceeded in expectation of the actual advantages achieved, i.e., in light of the existing technical problem, because there were corresponding suggestions in the prior art, see Case Law, 10th edition, 2022, I.D.5. This is not the case here.

5.5 The claimed process therefore involves an inventive step.

6. In conclusion, the Board finds that none of the grounds of opposition presented oppose the maintenance of the patent. According to Articles 111 (1) and 101 (2) EPC, the appeal of the patent holder against the contrary decision of the opposition division is to be granted, and the patent is to be maintained as granted.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1.

IV. The opposition division concluded, among other things, that the contested patent meets the requirements of Articles 87, 83, 54, and 56 EPC.

V. Independent claim 1 of the contested patent reads as follows:

""1. Lithium disilicate glass-ceramic having the following composition:

55 to 70 wt.-% SiO2,

10 to 15 wt.-% Li2O,

10 to 20 wt.-% of the stabilizer selected from the group consisting of ZrO2 or mixtures of ZrO2 and HfO2,

0.1 to 5 wt.-% K2O,

0.1 to 5 wt.-% Al2O3,

0 to 10 wt.-% of additives selected from the group consisting of boron oxide, phosphorus oxide, fluorine, sodium oxide, barium oxide, strontium oxide, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, calcium oxide, yttrium oxide, titanium oxide, niobium oxide, tantalum oxide, lanthanum oxide, and mixtures thereof, and

0 to 10 wt.-% of colorants,

wherein the stabilizer is essentially present in the amorphous phase.""

Claim 6 relates to a method for producing the glass-ceramic of claim 1, and claim 9 relates to its use.

Dependent claims 2 to 5, 7, 8, and 10 concern preferred embodiments.

VI. With the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant further submitted the following document:

Annex 1|Test results with supplementary revisions to D1.|

VII. In the communication pursuant to Article 15(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal 2020, the Board was of the preliminary opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.

VIII. The essential arguments of the appellant are summarized as follows:

The summons of the opposition division was not specific enough regarding priority. Therefore, the tests submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal ""Annex 1"" are an admissible response to the contested decision.

The priority of the contested patent is not valid due to the lack of the functional feature ""to increase chemical and mechanical stability,"" as only traces of ZrO2 as a stabilizer would not lead to this property. This was conceded by the respondents during the examination procedure.

Since the priority application contradicts a prevailing technical opinion, tests should have been submitted with the application to demonstrate that with the teaching of the application:

- Disilicate can be produced without unreasonable effort and

- the stabilizer remains in the amorphous phase.

Document D1, and in particular test B6, would demonstrate that disilicate can indeed only be produced with unreasonable effort.

Document D7 cannot close these gaps.

For analogous reasons, the invention of the contested patent is also not executable. Since the stabilizer content in the examples is relatively low, the invention is not executable across the entire range.

In view of each of documents D3 and D4, the requirements of Article 54 EPC are not met.

The requirements of Article 56 EPC are also not met in light of example 17 from D4, particularly since the effect of improved mechanical properties and improved chemical stability is not demonstrated.

IX. The arguments of the respondents (patent holders) are reflected in the following reasons for the decision.

X. At the end of the oral proceedings on September 21, 2022, the requests were as follows:

The appellant requests the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

The respondents request the dismissal of the appeal.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Article 12(4) RPBA 2007: Consideration of the newly submitted experimental results ""Annex 1""

For the following reasons, the experimental results ""Annex 1"" are not admitted (Article 25(2) RPBA 2020 and 12(4) RPBA 2007).

1.1 With the statement of appeal, the appellant submitted experimental results as ""Annex 1,"" which partially replicated experiments from D1 and partially conducted new experiments.

The respondents request that these results be deemed late and not admitted.

Indeed, the opposition division already considered in its summons to the oral proceedings dated March 20, 2018 (see point 5 of the summons) that the skilled person was able to carry out the teaching of the priority application without unreasonable effort by utilizing their expertise.

Therefore, the appellant must have been aware at that time that the disclosure of D1 might not be sufficient to convince the opposition division of the non-executability of the priority. However, they refrained from submitting further experimental results in the remaining year leading up to the oral proceedings in the opposition procedure.

Furthermore, the decision does not contain any surprising or new considerations that would have prompted the submission of the experiments.

Additionally, the appellant did not provide any reasons in their statement of appeal as to why they did not conduct and submit the experiments from Annex 1 at the first instance.

The experimental results from Annex 1 could have clearly been submitted in the first-instance proceedings and are therefore not admitted into the appeal proceedings (Article 25(2) RPBA 2020 and 12(4) RPBA 2007).

1.2 The appellant argues that the opposition division only criticized the lack of comparative experiments in the summons to the oral proceedings in connection with the requirements of Article 83 EPC (see point 6 of the summons), but not in the context of Article 87 EPC (point 5). Furthermore, the comments in point 5 of the summons were not specific enough, so there was no reason for the appellant to respond at that time. Only the contested decision, which refers to Figure 3 of D2 in point II.2 (in the penultimate paragraph on page 4), would have sufficiently clarified the issue.

This argument is not convincing, as the opposition division had already considered in its summons under the point ""5 Lack of Priority"" that the skilled person was able to carry out the teaching of the priority application without unreasonable effort by utilizing their expertise. In this context, the opposition division also explicitly referred to Figure 2 of D3. This figure clearly and unequivocally shows that the formation of lithium disilicate increases compared to lithium metasilicate with rising temperature. The appellant has also understood this (see the last complete paragraph on page 8 of the notice of opposition).

Missing counter-experiments cannot be cited as a reason under point II.2 of the contested decision, which affirms the priority. Therefore, there is no surprising development in this regard between the summons and the contested decision.

Further indications from the opposition division might even have been detrimental to a fair conduct of the proceedings, as they could have favored the appellant.

Thus, the opposition procedure following the grant under the EPC is fundamentally an adversarial procedure between parties that typically represent opposing interests but are indeed entitled to equal treatment (Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 10th edition, 2022, IV.C.1).

Each party is free to present their case as they wish. The opposition division should not unilaterally assist one party by providing them with prior indications. On the contrary, a party seeking a decision in its favor must actively participate in the proceedings and timely present everything that supports its position on its own initiative.

2. Article 87 EPC: Priority

The appellant holds the view that the invention of the priority application is not executable without unreasonable effort for several reasons, and that the priority of the contested patent is therefore not valid.

However, as will be demonstrated below, the priority document D0 discloses the same invention as the contested patent, in an executable manner, as the opposition division had already concluded. The contested patent therefore validly claims the priority of D0 (Article 87 EPC).

2.1 Claim 1 of the contested patent is based on claims 1 and 3 of D0. In contrast to claim 1 of D0, claim 1 of the contested patent lacks the functional feature ""[comprising at least 10 wt.-% of a stabilizer] to increase chemical and mechanical stability.""

According to the appellant, claim 1 of the contested patent does encompass the use of HfO2 with only traces of ZrO2 as a stabilizer, but this would not yield the desired effect, as the respondents themselves would have admitted.

However, this is not correct. D0 discloses the use of ZrO2 with HfO2 as a stabilizer within the claimed overall concentration in any mixing ratios, for example, on page 4, lines 23 to 29. There is also no evidence that a minimum amount of ZrO2 is necessary when using HfO2 as the main component to achieve increased chemical and mechanical stability.

Moreover, the letter from the respondents dated August 14, 2014, from the examination proceedings does not state this. It specifically mentions in point 2.1 that ZrO2 occurs in nature only together with HfO2 according to the then-current state of knowledge, so that ZrO2 necessarily contains traces of HfO2. It does not state that HfO2 does not act as a stabilizer.

2.2 Furthermore, the priority document, according to the appellant, does not contain an executable disclosure of the invention. D0 does not contain examples that show that lithium disilicate is produced, even though the patent contradicts a prevailing technical opinion. However, this would have been particularly necessary in the present case according to the second paragraph of Chapter II.D.3.1.6 of the case law (10th edition, 2022). It is also not permissible to fill the gaps in the teaching of D0 with the teaching of D7.

This position is also unconvincing.

Regarding the alleged contradiction between D0 and the prevailing technical opinion, it does not concern difficulties in producing lithium disilicate, but rather achieving the desired properties of the glass-ceramic despite the high stabilizer content. As stated on page 4, lines 15 to 33 of D0, it was particularly surprising that the stabilizer does not crystallize as a separate phase but remains in the amorphous residual glass phase.

It is also not understandable that the stabilizer, which remains in the amorphous phase, should hinder the formation of lithium disilicate in the crystalline phase. The passage on page 5, lines 12 to 17 of D0 merely states that an increased stabilizer content limits the crystalline proportion. Nothing is said about the ratio between the different silicate forms within the crystalline phase.

Setting a high stabilizer content in the mixture does not impose special requirements on executability. This has also not been disputed.

Moreover, examples do not necessarily need to be present in an application (Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 10th edition, 2022, II.C.5.3).

Pages 6 and 7 of D0 describe the procedural steps to be followed (temperatures and reaction duration of the various stages) to form the claimed lithium disilicate. Furthermore, steps b) and c) in claim 9 clarify that lithium disilicate is produced via the intermediate lithium metasilicate.

In particular, the skilled person knows from this teaching of D0 in combination with the general technical knowledge illustrated by textbook D7 what to do if the desired lithium disilicate is not formed in an experiment, but lithium metasilicate:

- The text above Figure 2-2 from D7 (page 82) and the text to the left of Figure 3-23 (page 223) also mention that lithium disilicate is indirectly produced from lithium metasilicate. The skilled person concludes that a longer reaction duration promotes the formation of lithium disilicate.

- Moreover, the chemical formulas of lithium metasilicate (Li2SiO3) and lithium disilicate (Li2Si2O5) already show that an increased ratio of SiO2 to Li2O in the starting material favors the yield of lithium disilicate. The phase diagram 2-1 on page 75 of D7 confirms this: Li2Si2O5 appears on the SiO2-rich right side of the diagram, while Li2SiO3 appears more at medium SiO2 concentrations.

- Finally, the DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) diagram 2-2 on page 82 and the XRD (X-ray diffraction) diagram 3-23 on page 223 of D7 show that an increase in temperature also favors the formation of lithium disilicate compared to lithium metasilicate.

Even though these diagrams of D7 strictly concern binary mixtures, they clearly indicate to the skilled person which parameters they would have needed to adjust to obtain the desired lithium disilicate. There is no evidence that this would not have led to success.

The passage of the case law cited by the appellant (Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 10th edition, 2022, II.D.3.1.6, second paragraph) specifically refers to T 81/87 and states that the essential features of the invention must either be explicitly disclosed or be directly and unequivocally implied. However, this case is not comparable to the present one, as there ""specific difficulties"" arose in a process for producing a genetic precursor from fragments of various clones that could only be ""solved stepwise,"" and where each step again ""depends on whether the circumstances of the evaluation of the results of the previous solution step have been correctly recognized"" (see in particular points 9 to 11 of the reasons for the decision). This is not comparable to the question in the present case of whether one silicate form or another is produced. An obligation for the patent holders in the present case to have already conducted experiments at the time of the priority application cannot be derived from this case law.

2.3 The appellant further argues that D1 proves that the teaching of D0 could not be executed without unreasonable effort. In examples G1, G5, and G6 of D1, lithium metasilicate is produced under the claimed concentrations and process conditions, and not the claimed lithium disilicate.

However, as the opposition division has already established, the experiments of D1 cannot demonstrate that the teaching of the priority application D0 is not executable. Even if lithium metasilicate is produced in these experiments of D1 from a composition and under conditions that lie within the ranges specified in D0 (and not lithium disilicate), the skilled person would have known based on their expertise (see point 2.2) how to achieve the desired lithium disilicate here as well.

2.4 The appellant specifically holds the view that a comparison of the experiment B6 submitted with the application of the contested patent with experiment G6 of D1 would demonstrate non-executability. Both experiments had identical SiO2 and Li2O concentrations as well as process temperatures, but example B6 predominantly produces lithium disilicate, while example G6 predominantly forms lithium metasilicate (see Table 2 of the contested patent and Table 2 of D1). These experiments would particularly show that the skilled person would also have to determine the concentrations of K2O, Al2O3, ZrO2 in an unreasonable manner within the claimed ranges to produce lithium disilicate.

This is also unconvincing. As explained in point 2.2 above, both D0 and the technical knowledge show that the formation of lithium disilicate occurs indirectly via lithium metasilicate. The skilled person concludes that a longer reaction time promotes the formation of lithium disilicate. Therefore, it is logical that in example B6 with a duration of 40 minutes in the first heat treatment, lithium disilicate is predominantly produced, while in example G6 with a first heat treatment that is only half as long, lithium metasilicate is predominantly formed. The duration of the second heat treatment of ten minutes is identical in both cases.

It cannot be ruled out that the different concentrations of K2O, Al2O3, ZrO2 in examples G6 and B6 also have an influence on the form of the produced silicate. However, there is no evidence that it is not possible to obtain the claimed lithium disilicate for certain concentrations of these components within the claimed ranges, even when applying the technical knowledge outlined above (see point 2.2).

2.5 In the oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal, the appellant further questioned the fact that the stabilizer remains in the amorphous phase despite the comparatively high concentration. Experimental evidence in the priority application would have been necessary for this as well.

As stated at the end of point 2.2, in the present case, an obligation for the respondents to present experiments cannot be derived from the cited case law, and the appellant has also failed to provide evidence for their doubts on this point.

The question of the admissibility of this new argument can therefore remain open.

3. Article 100(b) EPC: Executability

3.1 Compared to the priority application, the application of the contested patent additionally includes examples B1 to B6.

According to the opponents, the stabilizer concentrations in these examples (between 10 and 13.5%) are significantly lower than the claimed upper limit of 20%. The invention would therefore not be executable over the entire range. Otherwise, the objections against the validity of the priority would also apply mutatis mutandis to the requirements of Article 83 EPC.

However, the appellant has not provided evidence that the formation of lithium disilicate is not possible with higher stabilizer concentrations.

As for the other arguments, the reasons outlined above in point 2 apply analogously to the executability of the contested patent.

In the present case, the situation is particularly different from, for example, T 553/10, where a completion of the teaching with general technical knowledge was not possible.

For these reasons, the requirements of Article 83 EPC are fulfilled, as the opposition division had already concluded.

4. Article 100(a) EPC: Novelty

According to the appellant:

- D3 is novelty-destroying at least for the subject matter of claims 1 to 3 and 5 to 10

- D4 is novelty-destroying at least for the subject matter of claims 1 to 3, 5, 9, and 10

For the following reasons, however, the contested patent meets the requirements of Article 54 EPC, as the opposition division had already concluded.

4.1 Since the priority of the contested patent is valid (see point 2), D3 does not belong to the state of the art according to Article 54(3) EPC.

D3 is therefore not relevant for assessing the novelty of the subject matter of the claims of the contested patent (Article 54 EPC).

4.2 None of the examples from Table 1 of D4 (in particular not examples 11 or 17) disclose a content of ZrO2 or a mixture of ZrO2 and HfO2 in the claimed range of claim 1 of the contested patent.

The concentration ranges in the general part of D4 (page 2, line 61, to page 3, line 51) concern various compositions and the possible presence of ""further components.""

While the passages cited by the appellant from the guidelines refer to a selection from a single range, in the present case, a selection from several overlapping ranges is necessary to arrive at the subject matter of claim 1 of the contested patent (for example, for the components SiO2, Li2O, ZrO2, Al2O3, and K2O; see also Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 10th edition, 2022, I.C.6.3.3). Furthermore, an embodiment cannot be arbitrarily combined with the rest of the description but represents a self-contained, specific embodiment that only discloses a specific combination of individual components in very specific proportions (T 210/05, reasons 2.3).

Although D3 discloses a ZrO2 range of 0 to 10.0 wt.-% (page 3, line 28) with an endpoint that lies within the range of claim 1, given the particularly preferred range between 0.1 and 8.0 wt.-% (page 3, line 46), the skilled person would not seriously consider the endpoint of 10 wt.-%.

Neither the examples nor the general part of D4 therefore disclose the concentrations of the composition of claim 1 of the contested patent in combination.

Thus, the subject matter of claim 1 of the contested patent is novel (Article 54(1) and (2) EPC).

Due to the reference back to claim 1, this also applies to the remaining claims.

5. Article 100(a) EPC: Inventive Step

For the following reasons, the main request meets the requirements of Article 56 EPC, as the opposition division has already decided.

5.1 The invention relates to a lithium disilicate glass-ceramic.

5.2 Example 17 from Table 1 of D4 discloses a lithium disilicate glass-ceramic with a ZrO2 content of 6.1 wt.-%.

Since D4 also concerns translucent lithium disilicate glass-ceramics with high strength, example 17 from D4 is a suitable starting point for assessing inventive step.

5.3 According to the contested patent, the problem to be solved is to provide a composition with improved mechanical and optical properties as well as improved chemical stability (paragraph [0009]).

5.4 It is proposed to solve this problem by the composition of claim 1, which is characterized by a stabilizer content between 10 and 20 wt.-% ZrO2 or ZrO2 and HfO2.

5.5 In the oral proceedings in the appeal procedure, the appellant ultimately did not dispute that at least the task of improving translucency is successfully solved.

Table 2 of the contested patent indeed demonstrates a high translucency of the examples according to the invention. Furthermore, there is no evidence that would cast doubt on the successful solution of this problem.

Since the requirements of Article 56 EPC are also fulfilled with this problem as shown below (i.e., even considering the arguments of the appellant in this regard), it can be left open whether

- the request of the respondent is granted to disregard the appellant's arguments regarding this problem, and whether

- in addition to improving translucency, the mechanical properties and chemical stability are also improved.

5.6 The general part of D4 discloses on page 3, lines 25 to 36, that the melt of the starting glass ""preferably"" may contain further components, such as 0 to 10% ZrO2 (lines 25 and 28). This ""additional incorporation"" of ZrO2 leads to an increase in translucency (line 35).

Moreover, only the endpoint of 10 wt.-% ZrO2 lies within the range of claim 1 of the contested patent. Immediately following this ""preferable"" composition, a narrower range of ""0 to 8.0, in particular 0.1 to 8.0 [wt.-% ZrO2]"" is disclosed (line 46).

Starting from example 17, the skilled person would therefore select a ZrO2 concentration in the most preferred range of 0.1 to 8.0 wt.-% (line 46) to increase translucency, and not consider the endpoint of the broader range.

Due to its position in the text, the expression ""additional incorporation"" in line 35 should be seen in comparison to the preceding composition without ZrO2 (see page 2, line 64 to page 3, line 13). This expression cannot be equated with the statement that translucency is higher the more the weight proportion of ZrO2 increases.

Even if the skilled person were to select the endpoint of 10% from the broader range, it cannot be said how this would affect the concentration of the other components and whether they would still be within the claimed ranges.

The interpretation that the skilled person would proportionally reduce the concentrations of the other components is based on a retrospective view for which there is no evidence.

5.7 Therefore, the subject matter of claim 1 of the contested patent is inventive (Article 56 EPC).

Due to the reference back of the remaining claims to claim 1, inventive step is also present for these.

5.8 Regarding the process features of claims 6 to 8 of the contested patent, the appellant also refers to documents D5 and D6.

However, the appellant has not demonstrated where in these documents the composition of claim 1 of the contested patent is disclosed (to which claims 6 to 8 refer).

Therefore, these documents cannot suggest the subject matter of claims 6 to 8 (Article 56 EPC).","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",opposition rejected,opposition rejected,appeal dismissed,Ivoclar Vivadent AG,Ivoclar Vivadent AG Bendererstrasse 2 FL 9494 Schaan / LI,Uexküll & Stolberg Partnerschaft von Patent- und Rechtsanwälten mbB Beselerstraße 4 22607 Hamburg / DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The present appeal by the applicant (appellant) is directed against the decision of the examining division announced at the oral proceedings on November 23, 2018, and posted on January 8, 2019, to refuse European patent application No. 14 163 328.9.

II. During the proceedings before the examining division, the following prior art documents were cited, among others:

D3: WO 02/02075 A1

D'3: WO 03/011241 A1

III. The basis of the contested decision was the set of claims submitted during the oral proceedings before the examining division according to a main request and auxiliary requests 1 and 2.

In the matter, the examining division concluded, among other things, that the subject matter claimed in claim 1 of the main request was not inventive starting from the technical teaching of the prior art D'3 (Article 52(1) and 56 EPC):

The claimed subject matter differs from the subject disclosed in D'3 (cosmetic and dermatological emulsion preparations containing creatine and/or creatinine) by the specification that the pH value is in the range of 6.2 to 7.8. The objective technical problem is to provide an alternative preparation. The specification of a pH range within a common range for skin care products does not require inventive input.

The subject matter of claim 1 of both auxiliary requests differs from the disclosure in D'3 additionally by the choice of the included hydrocolloids. However, this is to be regarded as arbitrary and thus also not inventive.

IV. With her statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant submitted two amended sets of claims as a main request and auxiliary request 1. Claim 1 of the main request differs from claim 1 of the main request dealt with in the contested decision in that an option has been added for the selection of the hydrocolloids (b) and several other options have been removed, and has the following wording:

""1. Cosmetic or dermatological preparation in the form of an emulsion, comprising an oil phase, a water phase, and at least one emulsifier, characterized by an effective content of

(a) creatine and/or creatinine

(b) one or more hydrocolloids chosen from the group of

ba) organic, fully synthetic compounds of polyacrylic acids, preferably one or more polyacrylates from the group of carbomers of types 980, 981, 1382, 2984, 5984, and particularly preferably carbomer ULTREZ

bb) the co- and cross-polymers of polyacrylic acid derivatives chosen from the group of polymethacrylates, acrylate copolymers, alkyl acrylate copolymers, acrylamides, alkyl acrylate cross-polymers, acrylonitrile copolymers, polyacryloyldimethyltauramid

comprising at least one aqueous phase containing creatine and/or creatinine, having a pH value between 6.2 and 7.8, preferably between 6.5 and 7.5.""

Claim 1 according to auxiliary request 1 reads as follows:

""1. Cosmetic or dermatological preparation in the form of an emulsion, comprising an oil phase, a water phase, and at least one emulsifier, characterized by an effective content of

(a) creatine and/or creatinine

(b) one or more hydrocolloids chosen from the group of co- and cross-polymers of polyacrylic acid derivatives chosen from the group of polymethacrylates, acrylate copolymers, alkyl acrylate copolymers, acrylamides, alkyl acrylate cross-polymers, acrylonitrile copolymers, polyacryloyldimethyltauramid

comprising at least one aqueous phase containing creatine and/or creatinine, having a pH value between 6.2 and 7.8, preferably between 6.5 and 7.5.""

V. The appellant's arguments regarding the issue of inventive step can be summarized as follows:

The statements on page 6 of the application indicate the following points:

- The objective of the present invention is to find ways to avoid the disadvantages of the prior art. In particular, the claimed preparations should provide a remedy for the damage associated with endogenous, chronological, and exogenous skin aging or the corresponding prophylaxis in a lasting, sustainable manner without the risk of side effects.

- Creatine easily crystallizes in aqueous products, resulting in crystals with an uncosmetic appearance, which would reduce the effectiveness of the product.

- Another objective is therefore to find forms of administration for creatine that are characterized by a reduced tendency to form creatine crystals.

- This objective is achieved by the present preparations.

In paragraph 1 on page 16 ([sic], apparently meant is page 15) of the description, it is also stated that it is advantageous according to the invention to buffer the preparations.

As a result, these statements credibly demonstrate an inventive advantage that cannot be derived from D'3 and which is not contradicted by the present state of the art.

The subject matter of auxiliary request 1 differs from that of the main request in that the hydrocolloids present in the claims must be chosen from an even more narrowly defined group. However, in examples 2 and 3 of the prior art D'3, only ""polyacrylic acid"" is mentioned, so that the skilled person would have had to make an additional abstraction step to arrive at the subject matter of auxiliary request 1.

VI. In the event that the board could not follow these statements without further ado, the appellant requested, as an auxiliary measure, the holding of oral proceedings (Article 116(1) EPC).

VII. In accordance with this request, the board summoned the appellant to oral proceedings. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the board explained, among other things, its preliminary opinion that the subject matter claimed in the main and auxiliary requests does not involve an inventive step based on the technical teaching according to D3' or D3. The board pointed out the provisions of Article 114(2) EPC as well as Article 13(1) and (2) RPBA.

VIII. In a letter dated February 28, 2023, the appellant informed that she would not attend the oral proceedings scheduled for March 31, 2023, and maintained the previously filed requests. Furthermore, she submitted two additional sets of claims as auxiliary requests 2 and 3.

IX. The board then arranged for the cancellation of the oral proceedings.

X. The basis for the present decision are the following requests of the appellant:

Reversal of the contested decision and grant of a patent based on one of the claim sets submitted for the first time with the statement of grounds of appeal according to the main request and auxiliary request 1 or one of the claim sets submitted with the letter of February 28, 2023, according to auxiliary requests 2 and 3.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Admissibility of the Appeal

The appeal meets the requirements under Articles 106 to 108 EPC and Rule 99 EPC; it is admissible.

2. Decision in Written Procedure

Since the announcement of non-appearance at the oral proceedings (see point VIII.) is to be treated as a withdrawal of the appellant's request for an oral hearing (T3/90, OJ EPO 1992, 737, point 1 of the reasons for the decision, see also Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, tenth edition 2022, III.C.4.3.2), the Board was able to decide in the written procedure based on the file.

3. Main Request - Inventive Step

Subject Matter of the Application

3.1 The present application relates to cosmetic or dermatological preparations containing creatine and/or creatinine. The aim of care with these preparations is the treatment and prophylaxis of UV- and/or ozone-induced skin damage as well as inflammatory and degenerative skin conditions (see page 1, paragraph 1 of the application).

3.2 Claim 1 of the present main request specifies that the claimed preparation is an emulsion that contains creatine and/or creatinine in combination with specific polyacrylate-type hydrocolloids, with at least one emulsifier present and at least one aqueous phase containing creatine and/or creatinine [and that ?] has a pH value between 6.2 and 7.8.

D'3 as the Starting Point in the Prior Art

3.3 D'3 discloses cosmetic and dermatological preparations with an active ingredient combination of creatine and/or creatinine (D'3: claims and example formulations). These serve the same general purpose as the preparations claimed herein (D'3: page 1, paragraph 1).

3.4 The preparations according to D'3 may advantageously be emulsions (page 10, second and third paragraphs; examples).

3.5 The aqueous phase may advantageously contain thickeners, preferably from the group of polyacrylates, e.g., Carbopol (D'3: page 16, first paragraph).

3.6 Examples 2 and 3 in D'3 each describe several O/W creams, i.e., emulsion formulations with an oil and a water phase, containing creatine and creatinine (usually in concentrations between 0.1 and 1 wt.%) in combination with polyacrylic acid and emulsifiers. A pH value is not specified.

3.7 Polyacrylic acid falls under the definition in claim 1(b)ba), as the wording ""chosen from the group of organic fully synthetic compounds of polyacrylic acids"" can also refer to polyacrylic acids themselves and therefore does not exclude them. This was not disputed by the appellant. Furthermore, the prior art D'3 (page 16, paragraph 1) alternatively also provides for the use of polyacrylates, such as Carbopols of types 980, 981, 1382, 2984, and/or 5984, which also fall under the definition in point (b)ba).

Objective Technical Problem and Solution

3.8 The subject matter of the claim differs from the preparations disclosed in D'3 by the choice of the pH range of 6.2 to 7.8.

3.9 There is no evidence that the choice of this pH range achieves a particular technical effect of the claimed preparations compared to the preparations disclosed in D'3.

3.10 Thus, the objective technical problem is to provide an alternative preparation containing creatine and/or creatinine.

Avoidance of Crystal Formation as Claimed Technical Effect

3.11 In a passage of the application (page 6, lines 5 to 21), it is mentioned that creatine easily crystallizes in aqueous products. Another objective is therefore to find a formulation for creatine with a reduced tendency to form creatine crystals. This objective is solved by preparations containing creatine and/or creatinine and one or more hydrocolloids.

3.12 The appellant argued that, in conjunction with the remark found elsewhere (namely on page 15, first paragraph) that it is inventively advantageous to buffer the preparations, an inventive advantage is credibly established.

3.13 The Board cannot follow this consideration for the following reasons:

3.13.1 According to the information on page 6 (lines 14 to 21), the ""further objective"" is solved by the combination of creatine and/or creatinine with hydrocolloids. There is no mention of the pH value there.

3.13.2 The passage on page 15 does not explain in what specific context it is supposed to be ""advantageous"" to buffer the preparations, and does not specifically mention the avoidance of unwanted crystal formation as an advantage. Furthermore, the relevant text passage mentions pH ranges between 3.5 and 8.0 or between 6.5 and 7.5, but not the claimed range of 6.2 to 7.8.

3.13.3 The connection claimed by the appellant cannot be derived from the text of the application and is therefore not credibly established by the cited text passages.

3.13.4 Furthermore, claim 1 is not limited to buffered preparations, and there is also no evidence that creatine (or creatinine) in the preparations according to D'3 forms crystals when the pH value is outside the range of 6.2 to 7.8.

3.13.5 Thus, the claimed technical effect of avoiding unwanted crystal formation cannot be taken into account when formulating the objective technical problem, as there is no evidence for this technical effect in connection with the distinguishing feature relevant to D'3 (pH range of 6.2 to 7.8).

Obviousness of the Solution

3.14 The claimed pH range of 6.2 to 7.8 lies within the range commonly known for products for treating the skin. The Board agrees with the opinion of the examining division that the choice of pH value in a product-typical range to provide an alternative preparation cannot establish inventive step.

D3 as the Starting Point in the Prior Art

3.15 Furthermore, D3 can also be considered as an alternative starting point for assessing inventive step.

3.16 Like the present application, D3 deals with the use of creatine in cosmetic or dermatological preparations for the treatment and prophylaxis of UV- and/or ozone-induced skin damage as well as inflammatory and degenerative skin conditions (D3: claim 1).

3.17 Example 7 in D3 describes a sunscreen emulsion containing, among other things, 0.2 wt.% creatine, acrylamide/sodium acrylate copolymer, an oil and a water phase, as well as emulsifiers. A pH value is not specified.

3.18 Acrylamide/sodium acrylate copolymer is a hydrocolloid according to claim 1(b)bb) (and, with a broad interpretation of the term ""compounds of polyacrylic acids,"" also according to claim 1(b)ba)).

3.19 The distinguishing feature of the subject matter of claim 1 compared to the preparation in example 7 of D3 is the defined pH range of 6.2 to 7.8.

3.20 In analogy to the reasoning set out in points 3.8 to 3.14, the choice of a common, product-typical pH range for producing an alternative preparation is not to be considered inventive.

3.21 For these reasons, the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request does not involve an inventive step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC.

4. Auxiliary Request 1 - Inventive Step

4.1 Claim 1 in Auxiliary Request 1 differs from claim 1 of the main request by the omission of the options for hydrocolloids according to point (b)ba).

4.2 Since this does not result in any further distinguishing features compared to D3, it does not change the above-discussed analysis and conclusion regarding inventive step based on example 7 in D3. Consequently, the subject matter of claim 1 of the auxiliary request also does not involve an inventive step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC.

4.3 With the alternative approach based on D'3, another distinguishing feature would arise from the choice of a different thickening agent. A particular technical effect of the claimed preparation compared to the preparations from example 2 and 3 in D'3 is not apparent. Thus, the technical problem remains to provide an alternative preparation. The hydrocolloids mentioned in claim 1 of the auxiliary request are known excipients and thickeners for cosmetic products; for example, acrylamide/sodium acrylate copolymer is used in the very similar preparations of D3. Replacing the thickening agent with known alternatives does not require inventive activity from the skilled person.

5. Admission of Auxiliary Requests 2 and 3

5.1 In its letter dated February 28, 2023, the appellant submitted two new sets of claims as Auxiliary Requests 2 and 3, but did not explain how these claims could overcome the known objections and why they were submitted at such a late stage (namely just over a month before the oral proceedings scheduled in the appeal process).

5.1.1 Accordingly, under Article 13(2) RPBA, Auxiliary Requests 2 and 3 are not admitted - especially since a closer examination reveals that the newly added features in each claim 1 do not represent any further distinguishing features compared to D3 and/or D'3, and that these requests would not effect any change in the assessment of inventive step within the framework of the problem-solution approach.

5.1.2 The Board has therefore decided not to admit Auxiliary Requests 2 and 3.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",the application has been refused,the application has been refused,appeal dismissed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. European Patent No. 2 272 505 (hereinafter: the Patent) was granted with nine claims.

Claim 1 of the granted patent reads:

""Method for producing coated tablets containing Vardenafil Hydrochloride with a trihydrate content of at least 90 mol-% in solid form, characterized in that

a) Vardenafil Hydrochloride with any water content is used in the production of the coated tablets, and

b) in the final product, the Vardenafil Hydrochloride is converted into the trihydrate form by bringing the final product into contact with humid gas until at least 90 mol-% of the trihydrate has formed.""

Claim 7 of the granted patent reads:

""Coated tablets obtainable by the method according to at least one of claims 1 to 6, containing Vardenafil Hydrochloride trihydrate in an amount of 0.1-70 wt-%, a disintegrant in an amount of 0.1-10 wt-%, a lubricant in an amount of 0.1-2 wt-% and optionally further excipients as well as a filler as remaining components.""

II. Three oppositions were filed against the grant of the patent, which was based on a divisional application of the earlier European application No. EP 03763695.8 (originally published as WO2004/006894, hereinafter: ""parent application""). The grounds for opposition cited were lack of novelty and lack of inventive step under Article 100 a) EPC, insufficient disclosure under Article 100 b) EPC, and impermissible extension under Article 100 c) EPC.

The appeals of Opponent 1 (Appellant 1) and Opponent 2 (Appellant 2) are directed against the decision of the opposition division to reject the oppositions.

III. In the opposition proceedings, among other evidence, the following documents were submitted:

IV. The opposition division reached the following conclusions:

a) The combination of features of granted claim 1 was directly and unequivocally derived from the original disclosure of the parent application.

The features of the coating of the tablets and the minimum content of trihydrate did not represent a new selection in this context, as these features had already been described as preferred in the original disclosure.

The same applied to dependent claims 2-6 as well as product claims 7-9.

Thus, the subject matter of the patent did not contain an impermissible extension.

b) The patent contained information on the execution of the subject matter of the claims, including the determination of the crystal structure of the coated tablets. No facts were presented by the opponents that would allow the conclusion that this information was insufficient to obtain the claimed tablets.

Thus, the patent fulfilled the requirement of sufficient disclosure.

c) The subject matter of the patent included at least a twofold selection compared to the teaching of document D1, namely the Vardenafil Hydrochloride trihydrate as the active ingredient and the coated tablet as the dosage form.

Furthermore, document D1 did not describe the implementation of Vardenafil Hydrochloride into the trihydrate as defined in claim 1 by contact with humid gas or the amounts of the active ingredient, disintegrant, and lubricant as defined in claim 7.

Therefore, the subject matter of the patent was novel compared to the cited prior art.

d) The closest prior art was document D1.

The method claimed in claims 1-6 differed from the prior art in the selection of coated tablets as the dosage form for the defined active ingredient and by the defined implementation of Vardenafil Hydrochloride into the trihydrate by contact with humid gas, resulting in a content of at least 90 mol-% of the trihydrate. In view of the effects arising from this content as stated in the patent, the problem to be solved was to provide a method for producing coated tablets containing Vardenafil Hydrochloride with advantageous properties. The existing prior art contained no indications regarding the use of the trihydrate and the defined rehydration.

Claim 7 related to coated tablets with specific amounts of Vardenafil Hydrochloride, disintegrant, and lubricant, which are obtainable according to the method of claims 1-6. In view of the explanations in document D33a, which were referenced in the patent for the definition of coated tablets, as well as the description of non-coated tablets according to the official commentary on these explanations in document D33b, mantle tablets or the ""press-coated"" tablets mentioned in document D32a were not included in the definition of ""coated tablets"" in claim 7. Contrary to the opinion of the Board of Appeal in the decision in appeal case T 246/15 regarding the patent of the parent application, in which documents D33a and D33b were not available, the skilled person would not arrive at the subject matter of the claim by applying the compression coating mentioned in document D32a. Furthermore, no other coating method that would have enabled the production of the claimed coated tablets with the defined trihydrate content was demonstrated. Consequently, the considerations regarding the method of claim 1 applied analogously to the product claims 7-9.

Thus, claims 1-9 fulfilled the requirement of inventive step.

V. The appellants contested in the appeal proceedings the findings of the contested decision solely regarding the basis for the amendments in the originally filed parent application and regarding inventive step.

The further participating Opponent 3 did not provide any comments on the matter.

D47: Statement by Prof. Dr. Bauer-Brandl

IX. With the summons dated July 12, 2021, the Board invited the parties to an oral hearing.

In its communication pursuant to Article 15(1) VOBK 2020 dated August 6, 2021, the Board communicated its preliminary assessment that the objections of impermissible extension were unfounded and that the granted patent met the requirement of inventive step.

The oral hearing took place on May 6, 2022, with the participation of Appellant 2 and the Respondent in the form of a video conference.

X. The arguments of the appellants relevant to the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) The granted claim 1 defines a subject matter that goes beyond the content of the originally filed parent application, as the parent application does not specifically describe the feature of the 90% minimum content of the trihydrate in combination with the feature of the coated tablet or in combination with the feature of the finished tablet after rehydration. Additionally, dependent claim 2 defines time spans for rehydration that were only described in the parent application in connection with air of a certain humidity and in connection with certain devices. Furthermore, the amounts of components defined in granted claim 7 were not originally disclosed in connection with coated tablets.

b) Document D1, which already describes Vardenafil trihydrate as an active ingredient and mentions the processing of described active ingredients in common dosage forms, such as coated tablets, should be considered as the closest prior art.

The claimed minimum content of the trihydrate has not been proven to be associated with advantageous properties of the coated tablets. In particular, it has not been demonstrated that this minimum content of the trihydrate is associated with better reproducibility, advantageous disintegration time, higher stability, or lower variation in the bioavailability of the tablets.

Thus, the claimed method merely offers a solution to the problem of providing an alternative method for producing pharmaceutical preparations containing Vardenafil trihydrate. In formulation development, however, the intended tablets are routinely tested for their stability at temperature gradients of 5-50°C and humidity levels of 30-95%, particularly with regard to the appropriate use of excipients and the proper processing of active and excipient materials. This is evident from documents D2, D4, and D32a and is confirmed in documents D41a, D41c, and D41d. When conducting these necessary investigations, the skilled person would thus automatically and therefore in an obvious manner arrive at the claimed method.

The inventive step of the tablets defined in claim 7 should be assessed independently of the manufacturing method. The defined trihydrate content in mol-% does not involve a difference from the closest prior art and is also not proven to be associated with advantageous properties of the claimed tablets. The subject matter of claim 7 differs only by defining a generally known dosage form and using known suitable amounts of the active ingredient as well as common excipients. Document D32a indicates compression coating (""Compression coating"") as a generally known method for producing coated tablets, which, unlike the other methods mentioned in document D32a, does not require solvents and drying and is therefore suitable for producing the claimed tablets with high trihydrate content. The ""press-coated tablets"" according to documents D32a and D32b are, according to the expert statement of document D42a, to be regarded as ""coated tablets"" and thus as coated tablets in the sense of document D33a and the patent. Submitted images show a correspondingly smooth surface quality of both compressed and film-coated tablets. Furthermore, document D43 confirms in connection with document D44 that mantle tablets (press-coated tablets, dry-coated tablets) correspond to the definition of coated tablets in document D33a and the patent.

As a solution to providing a suitable dosage form for Vardenafil Hydrochloride trihydrate, this subject matter was thus obvious to the skilled person.

XI. The arguments of the Respondent relevant to the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) The originally filed parent application describes both the feature of the 90% minimum content of the trihydrate and the feature of the coated tablet of granted claim 1 as preferred. The duration of rehydration defined in granted claim 2 is explicitly disclosed in the parent application, regardless of the humidity level and the devices used. The amounts of the components of the tablets defined in granted claim 7 were clearly disclosed in the parent application and also refer to the preferred coated tablets.

b) Document D1 merely describes Vardenafil Hydrochloride trihydrate as an example of a variety of active ingredients that are to be formulated in a conventional manner.

The patent demonstrates through experimental results that rehydration into the trihydrate allows for the reproducible production of coated tablets with defined active ingredient form. Furthermore, this active ingredient is stable in the tablets at 30-80% humidity and results in a shortened disintegration time, rapid active ingredient release, and high relative bioavailability with only slight variation. The underlying problem of the claimed method is thus to provide a method for producing coated tablets containing Vardenafil trihydrate with improved properties. The skilled person could not derive any indication from the prior art regarding the claimed method as a solution to this problem.

The patent explicitly refers to coated tablets in the sense of the European Pharmacopoeia 3rd edition 1997, page 1852 (D33a). These are tablets that are coated with a layer and are normally produced using solutions or suspensions. According to documents D33b, D40, D43, and D47, compressed mantle tablets are not classified as coated tablets. The rougher surface texture of compressed tablets compared to coated tablets is evident from images with sufficient resolution. The production of the coated tablets claimed in the patent cannot therefore occur without drying and the associated dehydration of the active ingredient. The feature of the coated tablet cannot therefore be considered separately from the feature of the mol-% trihydrate content. The underlying problem of the tablets of claim 7 is to provide an advantageous dosage form. As a solution to this problem, the claimed tablets would not have been obvious to the skilled person, as there is no indication in the prior art of the claimed solution.

XII. The appellants requested that the contested decision be overturned and the patent be revoked in its entirety.

XIII. The Respondent requested that the appeals be dismissed. Alternatively, it requested that the patent be maintained based on one of the auxiliary requests 1-4, submitted on December 21, 2017, as well as auxiliary requests 5-13, submitted on February 1, 2019.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Admission of the documents and evidence submitted during the appeal proceedings

No objections were raised by the parties against the admission of the documents D41a to D41d, D42a, D42b, D43, D44, and D47 submitted during the appeal proceedings. The Board also has no concerns, so these documents will be taken into account in the appeal proceedings.

Main Request

2. Objections of impermissible extension

2.1 The arguments of the appellants regarding impermissible extension (Article 100(c) in conjunction with Article 123(2) and Article 76(1) EPC) only referred to the original disclosure of the parent application (D7) and did not contain separate statements regarding the content of the submitted divisional application. Therefore, only the parent application will be referred to below.

2.2 In line with the contested decision, the Board is of the opinion that

- the combination of features of claim 1 is directly and unequivocally derived from the original claims 1-3 in conjunction with page 8, lines 14-16, as well as page 2, lines 12-20, page 3, lines 4-7, and page 3, line 27 of the parent application (D7),

- the additional features of claims 2-6 are derived from page 3, lines 17-20 and lines 9-10 of the parent application (D7), and

- the quantity specifications for the tablets according to product claims 7-9 find their basis on page 4, lines 6-12, page 4, lines 14-16, and page 8, lines 18-23 of the parent application (D7).

2.3 The Board considers the finding of the opposition division that the features of the coating of the tablets and the minimum content of trihydrate were already preferentially described in the parent application to be correct (see D7, page 3, line 27 and page 8, lines 14-16). The definition of these features does not therefore represent a new selection. Furthermore, the claimed hydration of coated tablets is explicitly derived from the parent application (see D7, page 5, line 13 to page 6, line 4).

2.4 The argument that the time period defined in claim 2 of the patent was originally disclosed only in connection with certain further process features is, in the Board's view, not substantiated in light of the relevant sections of the parent application (see D7, page 3, lines 11-20 as well as page 6, lines 22-30).

2.5 Regarding the finding that coated tablets were originally described as preferred, the objection that the quantities of the active ingredient and excipients defined in claim 7 were described in the parent application only in relation to tablets and not specifically in relation to coated tablets (see D7, page 4, lines 7-12) is also unconvincing.

2.6 The Board thus concludes that the objections of impermissible extension are not justified.

3. Inventive step

3.1 Closest prior art

The parties agreed that document D1 should be considered as the closest prior art for assessing the inventive step of the claimed invention.

It was further undisputed that document D1 describes the active ingredient Vardenafil Hydrochloride Trihydrate as one example among many different active ingredients (see D1, column 26 and column 261, example 336) and, on the other hand, generally mentions the processing of the disclosed active ingredients into common dosage forms, including ""coated tablets"" (see D1, column 32, lines 6-16).

3.2 Process claims 1-6

3.2.1 The process according to granted claim 1 differs from the teaching of document D1 on the one hand in the selection of the dosage form of the coated tablet for the active ingredient Vardenafil Hydrochloride Trihydrate and on the other hand in the defined hydration step with the resulting trihydrate content of 90 mol-%.

3.2.2 According to the patent (see paragraphs [0032] to [0034]), the hydration step and the resulting trihydrate content of 90 mol-% are associated with the uniformity and stability of the crystal structure of the active ingredient, the rapid disintegration of the tablets, and the high dissolution rate of the active ingredient from the produced tablets. Comparative example 1 and examples 2 and 3 of the patent demonstrate the reproducible uniformity of the active ingredient and the rapid disintegration of the coated tablets produced according to the claims compared to similarly produced coated tablets that were not rehydrated with moist air after drying. Furthermore, the results presented in examples 3, 4, and 5 of the patent show the stability of the claimed tablets at 30% humidity as well as their rapid active ingredient release and low variability of relative bioavailability.

The concerns raised by the appellants both in the written proceedings and by appellant 2 during the oral proceedings, that the comparative tests described in the patent do not provide clear evidence for the advantageous reproducibility and disintegration time of the claimed tablets, are not considered justified by the Board in light of the specific information in the patent regarding the reproducible uniformity of the active ingredient form and shorter disintegration time of the claimed tablets. The further objection, which was also raised in the written proceedings and by appellant 2 during the oral proceedings, that the other results reported in the patent regarding stability, active ingredient release, and variability of bioavailability do not include a comparison to the prior art, is also not considered convincing by the Board, as the mentioned results in the patent do indeed demonstrate stability, rapid active ingredient release, and low variability of bioavailability, while document D1 does not describe a specific example of a dosage form containing the trihydrate for comparison.

The Board therefore agrees with the contested decision that the objective problem to be solved is to provide a process for the production of coated Vardenafil Hydrochloride tablets with advantageous properties.

3.2.3 Based on the teaching of document D1, one would not start from coated Vardenafil Hydrochloride Trihydrate tablets that need to be verified for further developments, but rather from Vardenafil Hydrochloride Trihydrate as an example of a variety of active ingredients that are to be formulated in a conventional manner according to document D1. In this context, there is no evidence that the claimed hydration of the coated tablets corresponds to a conventional manufacturing process. Furthermore, it is uncertain why a skilled person would focus on the trihydrate as the active ingredient and coated tablets as the dosage form after a possible determination of the loss of crystal water of Vardenafil Hydrochloride Trihydrate during the conventional manufacture of coated tablets. Even if the skilled person would consider further stability studies on conventionally manufactured coated tablets of the trihydrate, it remains questionable what conclusions could be drawn from stability studies lasting 6-12 months (see D2 page 532 table 6/16) that deal with the stability of the tablets to be produced. Document D41a states in this context (see D41a, page 2, line 20) that adjustments should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, the respondent rightly points out considerations in document D27 regarding the uniformity and integrity of the tablets (see D27, page 4, section 15), which argue against a subsequent hydration of coated tablets.

The Board therefore concludes that there is no indication in the existing prior art that points to the claimed process as a solution to the relevant problem, and thus the subject matter of process claims 1-6 meets the requirement of inventive step.

3.3 Product claims 7-9

3.3.1 The claimed tablets differ from the teaching of document D1 on the one hand in the selection of the dosage form of the coated tablet for the active ingredient Vardenafil Hydrochloride with a trihydrate content of 90 mol-% and on the other hand in the definition of the contained quantities of the active ingredient and excipients.

3.3.2 Regarding the feature of the coated tablet, the patent clarifies in paragraph [0018] that it concerns coated tablets in the sense of the European Pharmacopoeia, 3rd edition 1997, page 1852, which is presented as document D33a in the appeal proceedings.

According to the patent (see paragraph [0018]) and document D33a (see page 1852, left column, under ""Definition""), coated tablets are coated with one or more layers of mixtures of various substances, and these substances are typically applied in solution or as a suspension under conditions where the solvent or dispersion medium evaporates. Document D33a points out the smooth surface and the structure of the coating that differs from the core, and describes uncoated tablets as single- or multi-layered tablets that are produced in one or more pressing processes, where the layers can be arranged in parallel or concentrically and a coating is not recognizable (see D33a, page 1852 right column, 1st paragraph and left column, under ""Uncoated Tablets, Definition"").

The scientific commentary on the European Pharmacopoeia from 1998, which is presented as document D33b in the appeal proceedings, explains that uncoated tablets can be either single-layer, multi-layer, or mantle tablets (see D33b, page 5, right column). Document D35 also distinguishes between coated tablets on the one hand and mantle tablets, which are produced by pressing and whose appearance is not comparable to the elegance of coated tablets (see D35, page 18, right column). Contrary to the images cited in the appeal statement of appellant 2 (see pages 7-8), the images cited in the appeal response (see pages 42-44) confirm that, with sufficient resolution, the examined coated tablets exhibit different surface characteristics compared to the examined mantle tablets. Document D43 also refers to mantle tablets as ""press-coated tablets"" and distinguishes between the use of a gastro-resistant coating and the use of a gastro-resistant mantle granulate (see page 306, under mantle tablets and page 307, lines 4-8).

Consequently, in the Board's view, the opinion expressed by the expert Prof. Sawicki in document D42a, that the patented coated tablets can also be produced by the ""compression coating"" method described in document D32a (see D42a, page 2, lines 1-12), cannot be reconciled with the definition of coated tablets in the patent. The opinion in document D42a is, moreover, contradicted by the experts Prof. Breitkreutz and Prof. Bauer-Brandl in documents D40 and D47 respectively (see D40, page 3, section c; see D47, page 3, lines 12-13).

The Board notes in this context that document D33a (see page 1852, left column, under ""Disintegration Time"") describes a disintegration time of 15 minutes for uncoated tablets, while document D44 prescribes a disintegration time of 60 minutes for gastro-resistant tablets (see D44, page 717, under ""Gastro-resistant Tablets""). It can therefore be doubted whether the gastro-resistant mantle tablets suggested in document D43 exhibit the disintegration time described for uncoated tablets in document D33a. However, it cannot be concluded that according to the definition of document D33a, and thus also according to the patent, mantle tablets can also be classified as coated tablets, because document D33a explicitly refers to deviations in justified and approved cases regarding the disintegration time of uncoated tablets.

The Board is therefore of the opinion that mantle tablets, also known as ""press-coated tablets,"" are not encompassed by the patented definition of coated tablets and thus the ""compression coating"" method described in document D32a does not lead to coated tablets in the sense of the patent. The Board thus departs from the assessment in decision T 246/15 based on evidence that was not available in the appeal proceedings T 246/15.

3.3.3 The considerations in the above section 3.2.2 regarding the advantageous reproducibility and disintegration time of the tablets produced according to claims 1-6, as well as their stability, rapid active ingredient release, and low variability of bioavailability, equally apply to product claims 7-9, as they concern tablets produced according to claims 1-6.

The Board therefore sees the objective problem regarding the tablets of claims 7-9 in providing coated Vardenafil Hydrochloride tablets with correspondingly advantageous properties.

3.3.4 According to document D1, the described active ingredients, including the trihydrate of Vardenafil Hydrochloride, can be processed using known methods into common formulations, including ""coated tablets"" (see D1, column 32, lines 6-16). However, the patent shows in comparative example 1 and examples 2-3 that when applying common methods for producing coated tablets, in which solvents are used for the coating and drying is required, the resulting tablets do not have the claimed trihydrate content.

As explained in the above section 3.3.2, the skilled person would not arrive at the claimed coated tablets when applying the ""compression coating"" method from document D32a. Furthermore, there is no suitable instruction in the prior art for providing the advantageous coated tablets with the defined high trihydrate content.

Consequently, the Board concludes that the subject matter of claims 7-9 also meets the requirement of inventive step.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeals are dismissed.",opposition rejected,opposition rejected,appeal dismissed,"Zentiva k.s., Accord Healthcare Ltd, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.",Zentiva k.s.

I. European Patent No. 1 845 956 was granted with 15 claims. The relevant independent claims of the patent were as follows:

""1. Dosage form comprising

- a physiologically active substance (A);

- optionally one or more physiologically acceptable excipients (B);

- a synthetic or natural polymer (C); and

- optionally a natural, semi-synthetic or synthetic wax (D);

wherein the dosage form

- has a breaking strength of at least 400 N;

- contains neither Tramadol Hydrochloride nor Oxycodone Hydrochloride;

- releases at most 99% of the substance (A) under physiological conditions after 5 hours; and

- has a total weight in the range of 0.1 g to 1.0 g.""

""14. Use of a dosage form according to any of claims 1 to 10 for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention and/or treatment of a disease while preventing an overdose of the physiologically active substance (A), in particular as a result of crushing the medicament by mechanical action.""

""15. Use of a dosage form according to any of claims 1 to 10 for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention and/or treatment of a disease while preventing an unintentional disruption of the delayed release of the physiologically active substance (A) as a result of crushing the medicament by mechanical action.""

II. An opposition was filed against the grant of the patent. The grounds for opposition cited were lack of inventive step (Article 100(a) EPC) and insufficient disclosure (Article 100(b) EPC).

III. The Opposition Division decided to maintain the patent in amended form. This decision was based on the granted patent as the main request, an auxiliary request 1 submitted on January 10, 2019, and an auxiliary request 1A submitted during the oral proceedings on March 12, 2019.

IV. The following document was cited inter alia in the decision of the Opposition Division:

D4: W02005/016314

V. The Opposition Division reached the following conclusions in its decision:

a) The patent was sufficiently disclosed.

b) Documents D2-D5 belonged to the state of the art according to Article 54(2) EPC, as the priority date of the contested patent was the filing date, i.e., February 6, 2006.

c) The main request and auxiliary request 1 did not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC. The closest prior art was D4. The product of the main request differed from the products of D4 in the type of active ingredient. Since no effect was associated with it, the problem to be solved was consequently to provide an alternative. The solution proposed in the main request was obvious starting from D4. The product of auxiliary request 1 (product claim 8) further differed from D4 by excluding psychotropic substances in general. Since it was known to the skilled person that other active ingredients could show abuse potential, it would have been obvious for the skilled person to tablet these in the same manner as in D4.

d) Auxiliary request 1A met the requirements of Articles 123(2) and 123(3) EPC as well as Rule 80 EPC. The subject matter of auxiliary request 1A was restricted to the use of the products. The closest prior art remained D4. The use of auxiliary request 1A differed from the use according to D4 in that it remained therapeutic. The destruction of the dosage form in the present auxiliary request only led to an unintentional overdose and thus differed from the intended abuse disclosed in D4. The present dosage form produced a delayed release of the active ingredient and thus prevented an overdose. The use of a delayed-release dosage form to reduce the risk of overdose due to improper handling was not suggested in the state of the art. Auxiliary request 1A therefore fulfilled the requirements of Article 56 EPC.

VI. The opponent (appellant) filed an appeal against the above decision.

VII. In the response to the appeal dated January 23, 2020, the patent proprietor (respondent) referred to the maintained claims as the main request and further submitted 5 auxiliary requests (auxiliary requests 1-5).

VIII. The independent claims of the main request are as follows:

""1. Use of a dosage form comprising

- a physiologically active substance (A);

- optionally one or more physiologically acceptable excipients (B);

- a synthetic or natural polymer (C); and

- optionally a natural, semi-synthetic or synthetic wax (D);

wherein the dosage form

- has a breaking strength of at least 400 N;

- contains neither Tramadol Hydrochloride nor Oxycodone Hydrochloride;

- releases at most 99% of the substance (A) under physiological conditions after 5 hours; and

- has a total weight in the range of 0.1 g to 1.0 g;

for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention and/or treatment of a disease

while preventing an overdose of the physiologically active substance (A), in particular as a result of crushing the medicament by mechanical action.""

""2. Use of a dosage form comprising

- a physiologically active substance (A);

- optionally one or more physiologically acceptable excipients (B);

- a synthetic or natural polymer (C); and

- optionally a natural, semi-synthetic or synthetic wax (D);

wherein the dosage form

- has a breaking strength of at least 400 N;

- contains neither Tramadol Hydrochloride nor Oxycodone Hydrochloride;

- releases at most 99% of the substance (A) under physiological conditions after 5 hours; and

- has a total weight in the range of 0.1 g to 1.0 g;

for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention and/or treatment of a disease

while preventing an unintentional disruption of the delayed release of the physiologically active substance (A) as a result of crushing the medicament by mechanical action.""

Auxiliary request 1 is based on the main request, with the word ""in particular"" deleted from claim 1.

Auxiliary request 2 is based on the main request, with claim 1 deleted.

Auxiliary request 3 is based on auxiliary request 2, with ""disruption"" replaced by ""abolition.""

Auxiliary request 4 is based on auxiliary request 3, with the feature ""by oral administration"" introduced at the end of the feature ""for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention and/or treatment of a disease.""

Auxiliary request 5 is based on auxiliary request 4, with the feature ""contains neither Tramadol Hydrochloride nor Oxycodone Hydrochloride"" further amended by the introduction of ""nor any other psychotropic substance.""

IX. An oral hearing took place before the Board on July 28, 2021.

X. The appellant (opponent) requested that the contested decision be set aside and the patent be revoked.

XI. The respondent (patent proprietor) requested that the appeal be dismissed (main request). Alternatively, they requested that the patent be maintained on the basis of one of the auxiliary requests 1 to 5 submitted with the response to the appeal.

XII. The relevant arguments of the appellant for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) Main request

D4 is the closest prior art. Claims 1-2 of the main request do not represent second medical use claims because the prevention of an overdose or an unintentional disruption of the delayed release of the active ingredient does not define a further therapeutic application but is merely directed at a galenic problem. Furthermore, these effects are at least implicitly disclosed in D4. The present subject matter thus differs from D4 solely by the choice of an opioid different from Tramadol or Oxycodone. The objective problem can only be seen in providing an alternative. It would have been obvious for the skilled person to replace Tramadol HCl or Oxycodone HCl with another active ingredient disclosed in D4. Therefore, claims 1-2 of the main request do not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC.

b) Auxiliary requests 1-5

Auxiliary requests 1-5 do not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC mutatis mutandis. Regarding auxiliary request 5, it was noted that D4 generally relates to substances with abuse potential, while psychotropic substances were merely mentioned as examples. Other substances with abuse potential and without psychotropic effects are also generally known to the skilled person. D4 thus provides a hint towards the use of further substances with abuse potential in the described dosage forms.

XIII. The relevant arguments of the respondent for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) Main request

D4 is the closest prior art. Claims 1-2 of the main request represent second medical use claims. The claimed therapeutic uses (i.e., prevention of an overdose or an unintentional disruption of the delayed release of the active ingredient) cannot be derived from D4, as D4 concerns intentional abuse achieved through misuse. The present subject matter thus differs from D4 mainly by the new uses. Furthermore, the patient is also different, as the patient according to the contested patent is not an abuser, unlike in D4. The objective problem therefore lies in finding further uses for the break-resistant dosage form of D4 that allow for reduced patient care efforts. The use of delayed-release dosage forms with increased breaking strength to avoid overdose or disruption of the delayed release due to improper handling is not disclosed in any of the cited documents of the state of the art. Therefore, the main request meets the requirements of Article 56 EPC.

b) Auxiliary requests 1-5

Auxiliary requests 1-5 meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC mutatis mutandis. In particular, the subject matter of auxiliary request 5 is restricted to substances without psychotropic effects. In contrast, D4 exclusively concerns psychotropic substances. This constitutes another distinguishing feature. The problem to be solved lies in finding a use of the dosage forms from D4 that presents a lower risk to the patient. The skilled person would not have found any motivation in the state of the art to modify the dosage forms from D4 to include further active ingredients.","Reasons for the Decision

Main Request

1. Inventive Step

1.1 Closest Prior Art

1.1.1 In agreement with the parties, D4 is considered the closest prior art.

1.1.2 D4 discloses a dosage form that contains a physiologically active substance with abuse potential (A), as well as a synthetic or natural polymer (C) and, if necessary, physiologically acceptable excipients and a wax (see page 1, first paragraph). In a preferred embodiment, the dosage form is a sustained-release oral dosage form (see page 1, last paragraph; page 18, last 2 lines; pages 28-32; examples). Furthermore, the dosage forms produced in the examples have a total weight in the range of 0.1-1.0 g. The dosage forms disclosed in D4 are secured against abuse by preventing the crushing of said dosage forms (see, for example, page 2, paragraph 5 or page 10, paragraph 3). This is achieved by using a polymer that has a breaking strength of at least 500N. In a preferred embodiment, the entire dosage form has a breaking strength of at least 500N (see page 3, paragraph 2; page 20, paragraph 3). In this context, the Board notes that the use of an emetic and/or bitter substance mentioned by the respondent is merely optional. A large number of substances with abuse potential are mentioned in D4 (see pages 4-8). However, in the specific examples, only the active ingredients excluded according to the present claims (namely, tramadol hydrochloride or oxycodone hydrochloride) were used.

1.2 Difference

1.2.1 The parties disputed the interpretation of the independent claims of the main request. It was discussed whether the prevention of an overdose of the active ingredient (claim 1) or an unintentional disruption of the sustained release of the active ingredient (claim 2) defined a second medical use or merely a suitability for the stated purpose. In this context, both parties referred to various decisions of the Boards of Appeal (G 2/08, T 24/91, T 241/95, T 836/01, T 406/06, and T 2251/14).

1.2.2 The Board notes that no clear conclusion can be drawn from the cited decisions on this issue in relation to the present claims. However, the Board believes that this point is not decisive in the present case, as it does not constitute a distinguishing feature over D4. D4 discloses a first medical use, as it refers to dosage forms that contain pharmaceutical active ingredients. Furthermore, it is also clearly and directly derivable from D4 that it prevents an overdose of the active ingredient as well as a disruption of its sustained release for the following reasons.

a) D4 refers to a safeguard against abuse and thus implicitly discloses the prevention of an overdose.

During the oral proceedings, the respondent argued that the prevention of an overdose is not derivable from D4. D4 neither describes a normal dose nor a dose that causes a kick. Therefore, D4 provides no information regarding an overdose. As stated on page 1 of D4, abuse is not achieved through an overdose but rather through a change in the administration route (nasal after crushing or intravenous after crushing and extraction). An overdose merely through crushing and oral administration is therefore also not derivable from D4.

The Board cannot agree with this view. In the contested patent, the overdose to be prevented is also not achieved by an increased total amount of active ingredient but rather by the cancellation of the sustained release, i.e., the generation of a kick. The respondent's argument regarding the lack of information on a kick-causing dose in D4 is therefore unconvincing. The abusive administration route and any associated extraction of the active ingredient are also irrelevant, as both D4 and the present main request prevent the crushing of the dosage form and a resulting potential overdose. As the appellant pointed out, D4 also discloses the possibility of abuse through oral administration (see page 3, paragraph 5 and page 10, paragraph 3).

The respondent further argued that in the present case, the overdose is ""unintentional."" However, this argument is already unconvincing, as claim 1 does not impose any restriction in this regard.

b) D4 discloses the provision of a dosage form secured against crushing, which ""ensures the desired therapeutic effect"" when applied as intended (see page 2, paragraph 5). Sustained-release dosage forms are preferred in D4 (see examples). Furthermore, as argued by the appellant during the oral proceedings, it is explicitly mentioned on page 3, paragraph 3 that without sufficient crushing, no spontaneous release occurs. The prevention of the cancellation of the sustained release (and thus the assurance of the desired effect) is therefore disclosed in D4. The respondent's argument that ""intended use"" does not necessarily imply a prevention of the disruption of the sustained release is therefore not convincing in the present case.

Finally, the Board believes that an ""unintentional"" disruption of the release cannot be distinguished from an ""intentional"" one in the present case, as ultimately the cause of the disruption (namely the crushing of the dosage form) is intended in both cases (i.e., in D4 and in the contested patent or main request), albeit for different motivations.

1.2.3 D4 therefore discloses the same prevention (prevention of crushing of the dosage form) with the same consequence (ensuring the desired sustained release of the active ingredient and thus avoiding an overdose) as in the present main request.

1.2.4 In this context, the respondent argued that the present main request involves a new therapeutic situation. In particular, a new subgroup of patients could be selected.

First, the Board notes that no subgroup of patients is defined in the present claims. Furthermore, it seems that the fact that the administration of the medication can be left to the patients themselves without further supervision also applies in the case of D4. The respondent's argument that abusers in D4 may not be patients is therefore irrelevant in light of the wording of the claims of the present main request. Finally, the prevention of crushing does not lead to any special therapeutic effect compared to the intended use of the active ingredient in a dosage form not protected against crushing. The Board cannot recognize, contrary to the respondent's statements, any new treatment of a dysfunction or impairment of the body.

1.2.5 Contrary to the respondent's opinion, the claimed purposes (i.e., prevention of an overdose or prevention of a disruption of the sustained release) do not represent a difference from D4. The Board therefore sees the distinguishing feature solely in the type of active ingredient contained in the dosage form.

1.3 Objective Technical Problem

The Board therefore sees the objective technical problem starting from D4 as providing further non-pulverizable sustained-release dosage forms containing different active ingredients for the therapeutic use of said active ingredients while adhering to the intended release conditions.

1.4 Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

The Board notes that the description and claims of D4 generally concern active ingredients with abuse potential. D4 further discloses a variety of suitable active ingredients (see pages 4-8), with the examples being limited to tramadol hydrochloride and oxycodone hydrochloride. Consequently, it would have been obvious to the skilled person to replace the active ingredients from the examples of D4 with other active ingredients cited in D4 to solve the present problem.

1.5 The subject matter of claims 1 and 2 of the main request therefore does not involve an inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

Auxiliary Requests 1-4

2. Inventive Step

2.1 The amendments made in auxiliary requests 1-4 do not present any further differences from D4:

a) As already explained in point 1.2.2 a), D4 discloses the prevention of the crushing of the dosage form (auxiliary request 1).

b) Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 corresponds to claim 2 of the main request.

c) As already explained in point 1.2.2 b), the prevention of the cancellation of the sustained release is derivable from D4, see in particular page 3, paragraph 3 (auxiliary request 3).

d) D4 further discloses abuse through oral administration, see page 3, paragraph 5 and page 10, paragraph 3 (auxiliary request 4).

2.2 The auxiliary requests 1-4 therefore do not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC for the same reasons as explained for the main request.

Auxiliary Request 5

3. Inventive Step

3.1 Auxiliary request 5 differs from the main request by generally excluding psychotropic substances. Thus, all substances specifically listed in D4 are excluded. This merely creates another distinction from the disclosure of D4. However, the difference from the closest prior art remains unchanged, contrary to the respondent's view, and still lies in the type of active ingredient contained in the dosage form.

3.2 Consequently, the objective technical problem is the same as for the main request. In this context, the respondent argued during the oral proceedings that the problem to be solved is finding a use for the dosage forms from D4 that poses a lower risk to the patient. The Board cannot follow this formulation of the problem. The mentioned lower risk is not achieved according to the contested patent by the type of active ingredient but rather by the breaking strength. This is already disclosed in D4 and therefore does not constitute a difference from D4.

3.3 The solution proposed in auxiliary request 5 is still obvious. D4 generally mentions substances with abuse potential (see claim 1 and page 1) and thus provides a hint towards further substances. The disclosure of D4 is, contrary to the respondent's view, neither limited to the substances disclosed on pages 4-8 nor to psychotropic substances. In this context, the respondent argued that the abuse in D4 focuses on an ""euphoric"" effect. However, the Board notes that the ""euphoric"" effect is merely mentioned as an example of an abuse target in D4 (see page 1, paragraph 2, sentence 2 ""for example""). Furthermore, the Board notes that the subject matter of the claims of auxiliary request 5 is not directed at any specific substances but merely excludes the substances specifically mentioned in D4. The Board does not see how this exclusion can establish an inventive step. As pointed out by the appellant during the oral proceedings, non-psychotropic substances with abuse potential are known to the skilled person. The Board concludes that the skilled person would have replaced the active ingredients from the examples of D4 with other known substances with abuse potential and without psychotropic effects to solve the present problem.

3.4 The subject matter of the independent claim of auxiliary request 5 therefore does not involve an inventive step (Article 56 EPC).","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1.

Continuation of the Proceedings and Decision on the Appeal in Absence

The appellant as well as opposers 1 and 3, as further parties to the proceedings under Article 107 EPC, were duly summoned but did not attend the oral proceedings. The Board continued the appeal proceedings in accordance with Rule 115(2) EPC in the absence of the parties, treating them as if they relied on their written submissions in accordance with Article 15(3) RPBA 2020. By their non-appearance, these parties did not exercise their right to comment on the points discussed during the oral proceedings.

Main Request (Patent as Granted)

1. Article 100(b) EPC - Insufficient Disclosure

1.1 Admission - Reference to Objections Raised in the Opposition Proceedings

1.1.1 In addition to her substantiated factual submissions regarding certain objections concerning sufficient disclosure, the appellant stated in the statement of appeal (page 2, point 1) that she maintains all objections raised in the opposition proceedings.

1.1.2 According to Article 12(2) RPBA 2007, applicable under Articles 24 and 25(2) RPBA 2020, the statement of appeal must contain the complete factual submissions of a party, and it must clearly and concisely state the reasons for requesting the annulment of the contested decision. This requirement is not fulfilled by a general reference to objections raised in the opposition proceedings.

1.1.3 Therefore, these objections were not admitted into the proceedings by the Board based on Article 12(4) RPBA 2007. For this reason, the Board only decided on the objections that were substantively presented in the statement of appeal.

1.2 The Substantively Presented Objections in the Statement of Appeal

1.2.1 Claim 1 (see above) defines a crystalline micronized form of tiotropium bromide by a series of parameters, namely by

- a particle size X50 between 1.0 μm and 3.5 μm,

- with a Q(5.8) value greater than 60%,

- a specific surface area between 2 m²/g and 5 m²/g,

- a specific heat of solution greater than 65 Ws/g,

- as well as a water content of 1% to 4.0%.

1.2.2 The appellant argued that the contested patent discloses a single embodiment, namely the tiotropium bromide monohydrate produced in paragraph [0037], and thus provides only a point disclosure for each of the above parameters within their respective ranges. Therefore, the skilled person is not enabled to achieve all embodiments falling within the scope of the claim (i.e., parameter combinations with other respective range values). In particular, the contested patent does not show how a claimed micronization can be provided where all parameters lie within their particularly preferred ranges. Referring to decision T 435/91, the appellant argued that the contested patent therefore does not disclose a concept fit for generalization. The contested patent also does not teach how to obtain the claimed micronization with parameter values at the endpoints of the claimed ranges. In this regard, the appellant referred to D56.

The appellant further argued that the subject matter of claim 1 includes a product that is produced without a conditioning step. However, such a step is mandatory according to the contested patent (paragraph [0012]). This is confirmed by experimental reports D42 and D56. Therefore, the contested patent does not teach the skilled person how to produce the claimed micronization without a conditioning step.

1.2.3 The Board does not agree with this view. The present case differs from the reasons presented by the respondent (response to the appeal, pages 6 - 7, first paragraph) from the case underlying decision T 435/91.

1.2.4 In the latter case, the disputed feature was a functionally defined component of a composition. It was established by the competent Board (decision T 435/91, reasons 2.2.1) that this functional definition corresponded to a request to carry out a research program for which the contested patent did not contain a concept fit for generalization.

1.2.5 In contrast, in the present case, such a concept is provided by the description of the contested patent. For instance, the example in the contested patent discloses the production of the claimed substance (paragraphs [0037] and [0044] to [0045]). Furthermore, the description of the contested patent contains detailed instructions for producing a micronization characterized by the claimed parameters (paragraphs [0010] to [0013]).

1.2.6 Even if not all claimed parameters are fulfilled for specifically produced samples of D56, this does not provide sufficient evidence that the skilled person, despite the guidance provided in the contested patent, is unable to work within the claimed range.

1.2.7 Regarding the absence of a conditioning step in claim 1 mentioned by the appellant, the Board agrees with the respondent (response to the appeal, page 7, second paragraph) and the opposition division (reasons for the decision, 6.8). In particular, claim 1 refers to a product and not to a process. As long as this product - with or without a conditioning step - is available, there is no deficiency in disclosure. In this regard, the Board notes that the contested patent describes in detail how the conditioning step should be carried out in paragraph [0012]. Thus, the contested patent teaches the skilled person how to produce the claimed product. Therefore, there is no deficiency in disclosure in the sense of Article 100(b) EPC.

1.2.8 Finally, the Board notes that according to the established case law of the Boards of Appeal, an objection of insufficient disclosure can only succeed if there are serious doubts substantiated by verifiable facts. However, in the present case, there is no evidence that the skilled person would not arrive at a claimed micronization when reworking the example under the conditions specified in the contested patent.

1.3 Thus, the Board concludes that the ground for opposition under Article 100(b) EPC does not preclude the maintenance of the contested patent.

2. Novelty - Article 100(a) and Article 54 EPC

2.1 Admission - Reference to Objections Raised in the Opposition Proceedings

In addition to her substantiated factual submissions in the statement of appeal regarding novelty, the appellant stated in the statement of appeal (page 2, point 1) that she maintains all objections raised in the opposition proceedings.

For the reasons set out above in connection with sufficient disclosure, the Board did not admit these objections raised merely by reference to the opposition proceedings based on Article 12(4) RPBA 2007. Therefore, the Board only decided on the objections that were substantively presented in the statement of appeal.

2.2 The Substantively Presented Objections in the Statement of Appeal

2.2.1 The appellant argued that the subject matter of claim 1 is not novel over patent document D9.

2.2.2 As stated by the opposition division (contested decision, 7.16), D9 discloses the use of tiotropium bromide, which is ground to a particle size of 1 μm to 5 μm (D9, page 9, example 3). Regarding the production of this tiotropium bromide, D9 refers to US 5,610,163 (D46; see D9, page 3, lines 1 to 4), which corresponds to the US equivalent of D6.

2.2.3 In experimental report D23, tiotropium bromide monohydrate according to the contested patent and tiotropium bromide according to D6 were micronized in an air jet mill under identical conditions (D23, page 1, paragraph 2), resulting in a claimed micronization and a micronization according to the prior art (""micronization according to the prior art""). The obtained samples were then characterized with respect to the claimed parameters according to the methods described in the contested patent.

2.2.4 The results (D23, page 1, first table) show that the claimed micronization has a water content of 2.7%, while the ""micronization according to the prior art"" (i.e., the sample reworked according to D6 and then micronized) meets all parametric requirements of claim 1, but does not meet the claimed water content. This is 0.9% and thus below the claimed lower limit of 1%.

2.2.5 Another claimed micronization with a water content of 1.4% was produced according to experimental report D65 (D65, first table on page 1, ""Claimed Micronization, (Sample 1)""). D65 also includes the data listed in D23.

2.2.6 The appellant argued that the water content of the sample ""micronization according to the prior art"", in D23 and D65 (0.9%) falls within the claimed range. In particular, the lower limit of the claimed range, namely 1%, according to the rounding convention includes values from 0.5% to 1.4%.

2.2.7 The Board agrees with the appellant that according to the rounding convention, the values 0.5 and 1.4 can each be rounded to the value 1. However, this does not mean that the reverse is true, that is, that the value 1 can be rounded down to 0.5 or up to 1.4. According to the Board, this cannot be inferred from the rounding convention. Furthermore, the appellant's argument based on the rounding convention would not succeed even if she had applied the rounding convention correctly. This rounding convention applies in the field of mathematics. However, the patent claim in question is not directed to a mathematician, but to a skilled person working in the field of inhalation powders. Such a skilled person is familiar with the fact that the measurement of water contents may involve some error and that values given for a water content should be read in light of these error margins and thus include values within this error range. However, the appellant has not provided any evidence that, when considering such error margins, the water content of 1% mentioned in claim 1 is identical to the value of 0.9% present in the prior art, or at least overlaps. Therefore, the two values must be regarded as different. For this reason alone, the water content is to be considered a distinguishing feature.

2.2.8 The Board further agrees with the reasoning of the opposition division (contested decision, 7.17, third paragraph). Just as D23 describes, experimental report D59 describes the reworking of the production of tiotropium bromide according to D6 (D59, page 1, ""TBA Sample SC235/t=0""). According to Table 1 (D59, page 4), a water content of 0.3% was determined for the reworked sample, which, even considering the rounding convention cited by the appellant, is clearly below the lower limit of the claimed range of 1% to 4%. The Board agrees with the conclusion drawn by the opposition division in point 7.17, page 31 of their decision:

""... Therefore, if the same prior art is reworked twice, and different water contents for the micronization were determined [0.9% in D23 and D65 and 0.3% in D59], and if the value from the reworking of O-III (D59, Table 1) is indisputably beyond any rounding interpretation of the claimed feature 1e 'water content 1 - 4.0%', then the water content cannot indisputably be an inherent feature from the prior art D9 at a level that - possibly after rounding - falls within the claim range of feature 1e."" (Addition in square brackets by the Board)

2.2.9 Thus, the Board also concludes based on the differing results in D23 and D65 on the one hand and D59 on the other, in line with the decision of the opposition division, that the claimed water content is not disclosed directly and unambiguously in D9.

2.2.10 In this regard, the argument put forward by the appellant in the statement of appeal that the opposition division should not have followed the respondent's statements, as they were not supported by technical details (statement of appeal, page 5, point 2), is not convincing.

2.2.11 In particular, the appellant did not justify why the above conclusion of the opposition division, which arises from a comparison of D23 and D59, is not correct. Consequently, the conclusion of the opposition division in this regard was not substantively challenged by the appellant, as rightly noted by the respondent.

2.3 Thus, the Board concludes that novelty over D9 is present and therefore the ground for opposition under Article 100(a) EPC in conjunction with Article 54 EPC does not preclude the maintenance of the patent.

3. Inventive Step - Article 100(a) and Article 56 EPC

The appellant argued that the claimed subject matter does not involve an inventive step in view of D9 or D14 as the closest prior art.

Starting from D9

3.1 Distinguishing Features

As set out above regarding novelty, the claimed water content of 1 to 4% constitutes a distinguishing feature over D9.

3.2 Technical Effect

3.2.1 The respondent referred to experimental reports D23 and D65 as evidence of a technical effect. It was argued that the experiments contained therein showed that the aforementioned distinguishing feature leads to improved storage stability.

3.2.2 As stated above, D9 refers to the production of tiotropium bromide to US 5,610,163 (D46), which corresponds to the US equivalent of D6.

As also stated above, in D23, tiotropium bromide monohydrate according to the contested patent and tiotropium bromide according to D6 were micronized in an air jet mill under identical conditions. The product resulting from the micronization of tiotropium bromide monohydrate constitutes a claimed micronization. The product resulting from the micronization of D6 constitutes a product according to the closest prior art D9 and is referred to in D23 as ""micronization according to the prior art"" (D23, page 1, first table).

3.2.3 These two samples from D23 were subjected to a three-day stress storage at 40°C and 75% relative humidity and were finally characterized again. The results (D23, page 1, second table) show that during this stress storage, both the median (X50) and the particle size distribution of the ""claimed micronization"" shift much less to larger particles than is the case with the prior art according to D6 (and therefore also D46) (D23, page 2, first paragraph). Thus, the storage stability of the claimed micronization is improved compared to that of the prior art.

3.2.4 Experimental report D65 refers to the samples that were also tested in D23. Additionally, D65 also contains data for another ""claimed micronization"" with a claimed water content of 1.4% (D65: ""Sample 1""). For this sample, an improvement in storage stability compared to the prior art sample is also shown.

3.2.5 The appellant did not dispute that the ""claimed"" samples in D23 and D65 show an improvement in storage stability compared to the samples according to the prior art (""micronization according to the prior art"").

3.2.6 Rather, the appellant raised the following objections:

3.2.7 First, the appellant argued that the example ""micronization according to the prior art"" in D23 and D65 has been ""modified in the distinguishing feature.""

This submission seems to imply that according to the appellant, the ""micronization according to the prior art"" in D23 and D65 does not correspond to the micronization of the closest prior art D9, so that a comparison of the claimed micronizations with the ""micronization according to the prior art"" cannot establish a technical effect over the closest prior art.

The Board cannot follow this. As stated above, the water content constitutes the distinguishing feature over D9, and no water content is disclosed in D9. To demonstrate a technical effect attributable to the water content, the respondent had to compare a micronization with the claimed water content to a micronization with a non-claimed water content. This is precisely what the respondent did by comparing the claimed micronizations with the ""micronization according to the prior art"" in D23 and D65. In doing so, she even chose a comparison sample with a water content (0.9%) that is very close to the claimed lower limit of 1% and still obtained the aforementioned technical effect of improved storage stability.

A ""modification"" of the ""micronization according to the prior art"" produced in D23 and D65 compared to the closest prior art has only occurred, as stated in the response to the appeal (point b) on page 24), in that the sample produced according to the closest prior art was micronized. However, as also stated by the respondent, this micronization was necessary to obtain a material that differs only in terms of water content from the closest prior art. Thus, the comparison example ""micronization according to the prior art"" in D23 and D65 is also not objectionable in this regard.

3.2.8 Second, the appellant argued that the water content of 0.9% of the sample ""micronization according to the prior art"" in D23 (and D65) falls within the claimed range. In particular, the lower limit of the claimed range, namely 1%, according to the rounding convention includes values from 0.5% to 1.4%. Therefore, the comparison in D23 and D65 is not suitable to demonstrate an improvement over the prior art D9.

However, as stated above, the water content of 0.9% of the sample ""micronization according to the prior art"" in D23 and D65 does not fall within the range defined for water content in claim 1.

3.2.9 Third, the appellant argued that the experiments of D23 and D65 compared tiotropium bromide with different crystal modifications. The appellant referred to the crystal data contained in the contested patent (paragraph [0041]) and in document D71. Therefore, any comparison is a comparison of ""apples and oranges,"" and thus a technical effect is claimed that cannot credibly be attributed to the distinguishing feature.

3.2.10 The Board does not share this view either. In particular, as stated in the response to the appeal (point c) starting on page 24), this is also not correct. It is true that, as stated by the appellant, tiotropium bromide anhydrate, which has a water content of 0%, and tiotropium bromide monohydrate differ not only in water content but also in crystal structure. However, these forms are not compared in D23 and D65. As stated above, these documents compare micronized tiotropium bromide with a water content of 0.9% with micronized tiotropium bromides with water contents of 1.4% and 2.7%. As the respondent has stated in writing, there is no evidence from the appellant that the samples tested in D23 and D65 also differ in crystal structure. Without such evidence, the appellant's argument cannot succeed.

3.2.11 Finally, the appellant argued that D23 and D65 can only show a technical effect for a specific crystalline form. Since the claim is not limited to a specific crystalline form, the technical effect of improved storage stability cited by the appellant is not demonstrated across the entire scope of the claim.

The Board cannot agree with this argument either. As stated above, the respondent has presented experiments with D23 and D65 that demonstrate improved storage stability compared to the closest prior art for two claimed samples. In contrast, the appellant has provided no experimental evidence that any of these two claimed samples show no improved storage stability. In the absence of such experimental evidence, this argument of the appellant cannot succeed either.

3.2.12 Thus, the Board concludes that the data in D23 and D65 sufficiently demonstrate the technical effect of improved storage stability claimed by the respondent.

3.3 Consideration of the Technical Effect Shown in D23 and D65 in Light of G 2/21

3.3.1 In addition to the points discussed above, the appellant argued that the experimental data in D23 and D65 are post-published and that the originally filed application does not contain any indication of the technical effect of improved storage stability shown in D23 and D65. Therefore, this effect cannot be considered in the context of inventive step.

3.3.2 The question of the possible consideration of a technical effect was discussed in the decision of the Enlarged Board of Appeal G 2/21 of March 23, 2023 (OJ EPO 2023, A85).

3.3.3 Point 1 of the decision states as follows:

""Evidence presented by a patent applicant or owner to demonstrate a technical effect and on which they rely for the recognition of inventive step of the claimed subject matter may not be disregarded solely on the grounds that such evidence, on which the effect is based, was not publicly accessible before the filing date of the contested patent and was only submitted after that date.""

According to point 1 of the decision, the fact that D23 and D65 are post-published does not, in itself, exclude the possibility that this evidence, which demonstrates the technical effect of improved storage stability (see point 3.2 above), can be considered.

3.3.4 Point 2 of the decision G 2/21 states as follows:

""A patent applicant or owner may invoke a technical effect to demonstrate inventive step if the skilled person would conclude from the general knowledge and based on the application as originally filed that this effect is encompassed by the technical teaching and embodies the same originally disclosed invention.""

3.3.5 Since the issuance of decision G 2/21, the aforementioned considerations must therefore be used as a basis for determining whether a technical effect can be recognized in the context of the examination of inventive step. According to the wording of point 2 of the decision, the assessment of whether such an effect can be derived from the application as originally filed must be based on two criteria, namely ""encompassed by the technical teaching"" and ""embodied by the same originally disclosed invention."" It follows from the reasoning of the decision, for example, points 71 and 93.

3.3.6 In point 71, the Enlarged Board of Appeal stated that it derives from the previous case law of the Boards of Appeal as a common basis that the core issue is what the skilled person would understand as the technical teaching of the claimed invention based on the general knowledge at the filing date of the application as originally filed.

3.3.7 As stated above, the respondent in the present case relies on the technical effect of improved storage stability demonstrated by D23 and D65. The assessment of whether this technical effect can be considered in the examination of inventive step must therefore be made from the perspective of the skilled person, who, using their general knowledge, starts from the application as originally filed.

From this specific perspective of the skilled person, it must be assessed whether the mentioned technical effect can be derived as ""encompassed by the technical teaching and embodied by the same originally disclosed invention.""

3.3.8 In the Board's opinion, the derivability as ""encompassed by the technical teaching"" and ""embodied by the same originally disclosed invention"" are two criteria that must be fulfilled cumulatively.

3.3.9 In this context, the Board also considers point 93 of the reasoning of G 2/21 to be particularly significant. This states:

""The relevant standard for relying on a claimed technical effect in assessing whether the claimed subject matter has inventive step is the question of what the skilled person would understand as the technical teaching of the claimed invention based on the general knowledge at the filing date of the application as originally filed. The technical effect, also claimed at a later date, must be encompassed by this technical teaching and embody the same invention, as such an effect does not change the nature of the claimed invention.""

3.3.10 From these statements of the Enlarged Board of Appeal, it follows that a technical effect can also be claimed at a later date, i.e., after the filing date, in the proceedings. It is not a prerequisite for recognizing a technical effect in the context of assessing inventive step that this claimed effect must be explicitly mentioned or evidenced in the application as originally filed. Rather, a technical effect demonstrated by post-published evidence can be recognized in the sense of point 2 of the decision G 2/21 if it is encompassed by the technical teaching of the originally filed application and can be derived as embodied by the same originally disclosed invention. This, in turn, means that with respect to this technical effect, the nature of the claimed invention is not changed compared to the originally disclosed invention.

3.3.11 In this context, as stated by the respondent in the oral proceedings, the following passages of the application as originally filed are of particular importance:

On page 1, line 22 to page 2, line 2, it is disclosed that tiotropium bromide is a highly effective anticholinergic agent and can provide therapeutic benefit in the treatment of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is noted that the application of tiotropium bromide is preferably via inhalation and that it is necessary to provide the active ingredient in micronized form for inhalation. Preferably, the active ingredient has an average particle size of 0.5 μm to 10 μm, preferably from 1 μm to 6 μm, and particularly preferably from 1.5 μm to 5 μm.

According to page 2, lines 14 to 18, it is

""... the object of the present invention to provide a process for making micronized tiotropium bromide in a form that meets the high requirements directed at an inhalatively administered active ingredient and takes into account the specific properties of tiotropium bromide.""

According to page 6, lines 28 to 30, another aspect of the present invention is

""An inhalation powder characterized by a content of the claimed tiotropium bromide micronization.""

Finally, it is disclosed on page 7, lines 5 to 8:

""Accordingly, the present invention aims at inhalation powders containing at least about 0.03%, preferably below 5%, particularly preferably below 3% of the tiotropium bromide micronization obtainable by the method described above...""

3.3.12 The application as originally filed therefore focuses on the use of the claimed micronizations as inhalation powders and teaches that a specific particle size range is required for administration by inhalation. Since there is necessarily a certain time lapse between the production of a medicinal product and its administration, it can be derived from the application as originally filed that particle size stability (corresponding to the storage stability demonstrated in D23 and D65) is an essential requirement for the administration of the medicinal product as claimed.

3.3.13 Furthermore, as stated by the respondent in the oral proceedings, it was generally known to the skilled person before the priority date of the application that the stability of particle size is crucial for the administration of a medicinal product by inhalation. As evidence of general knowledge, the respondent referred to documents D1, D16a, D16b, and D17.

D1 is a review article published in 1998 and concerns dry powder formulations for pulmonary (i.e., inhalation) delivery (""Dry powder formulations for pulmonary delivery""). It states that the maximum particle size for deposition in the central airways is 5 μm and for deposition in the periphery/deep lung is 2 to 3 μm. Larger particles are retained by the lung's protective mechanisms, while particles smaller than 0.5 μm are exhaled (D1, page 395, left column, lines 1 to 5).

D1 thus shows that it was generally known to the skilled person that particle size is a critical factor for the inhalation delivery of a drug.

D16a is an excerpt from a book published in 2001 titled ""Particulate interactions in dry powder formulations for inhalation."" In section 3.6.1 (page 86, first sentence), it states that the deposition properties and effectiveness of an aerosol largely depend on particle size. In the same book (D16b; page 136, section 5.1), it is noted that it is generally accepted that drug particles must have an aerodynamic diameter between 1 and 5 μm for the drug to reach the lower airways.

D17 is a document from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) titled ""Guidance for Industry"" concerning inhalation drugs (""Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) and Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) Drug Products""). This document teaches that the particle size distribution (among other factors) is critical, and that maintaining it during the shelf life is likely the greatest challenge (lines 103 to 105). It is also noted that the particle size distribution of a drug should be determined and monitored in the formulation at the initial and final doses (lines 792 to 974).

3.3.14 Based on his above-mentioned expertise regarding the necessary particle size/particle size distribution when using inhalation powders for medical administration, the skilled person would recognize from the originally filed version of the application that tiotropium bromide, due to the disclosed particle sizes and its intended use, also has adequate particle size stability. This stability corresponds to the technical effect of storage stability cited by the respondent for inventive step. Therefore, the skilled person would directly conclude from the application as originally filed regarding the use of the claimed micronization as an inhalation product to the storage stability of this product. Nothing can be derived from the originally filed application or the general knowledge that casts doubt on the achievement of this storage stability by the claimed subject matter, and no such doubt was expressed by the appellant. It can thus be derived from the originally filed application that this technical effect is encompassed by the technical teaching of the application and embodied by the same originally disclosed invention.

3.3.15 In this context, the Board acknowledges that the technical effect derivable from the originally filed application in the sense of point 2 of the decision G 2/21 consists in a storage stability as such, while the effect shown by D23 and D65 is the improvement of this storage stability over the cited closest prior art.

3.3.16 In the Board's opinion, once the aforementioned criterion of derivability of a technical effect is fulfilled, this equally applies to the improvement of this effect. Specifically, the skilled person, even without inventive skills, would strive for developments or technical improvements in any field of technology. Therefore, if a specific technical effect, such as in the present case the storage stability, is derivable for the skilled person in the sense of the decision formula, point 2 of decision G 2/21 from the originally filed application, its improvement should also be regarded as implicitly derivable.

3.3.17 Thus, the fact that the technical effect cited by the respondent consists in a storage stability that is improved over the closest prior art does not preclude its consideration in light of decision G 2/21.

3.3.18 Consequently, the technical effect of improved storage stability shown in the post-published documents D23 and D65 does not change the nature of the claimed invention.

3.3.19 Therefore, the improved storage stability shown in D23 and D65 can be considered in light of decision G 2/21.

3.4 The Objective Technical Problem

Based on the technical effect of improved storage stability, the objective technical problem is to provide a tiotropium inhalation powder with improved storage stability.

3.5 Obviousness of the Solution

Neither in D9 nor in the other prior art cited by the appellant is there any indication that this problem can be solved by the crystalline micronization of claim 1. The appellant has also not presented any arguments that the claimed subject matter would not involve an inventive step if the technical effect of improved storage stability were recognized and considered.

3.6 For the reasons stated above, the Board has concluded that starting from D9, the subject matter of claim 1 according to the main request is based on an inventive step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC.

4. Starting from D14 as the Closest Prior Art

4.1 D14 is an announcement by the New Zealand Minister of Health regarding the approval of ""Spiriva,"" which contains tiotropium bromide monohydrate. The dosage form is stated to be a powder-filled inhalation capsule (D14, page 3594, last product). None of the claimed parameters are explicitly mentioned in D14.

4.2 The appellant recognized that the subject matter of claim 1 differs from D14 by the following features:

- the feature that the active ingredient is crystalline,

- a specific surface area between 2 m²/g and 5 m²/g, and

- a specific heat of solution greater than 65 Ws/g.

4.3 The data contained in D23 and D65 demonstrate that the claimed micronization exhibiting the above features has good storage stability. The objective technical problem is therefore to provide a form of tiotropium bromide for inhalation with good storage stability.

4.4 Neither D14 nor any other document teaches the skilled person that this problem can be solved with a form of tiotropium bromide according to claim 1.

4.5 For the reasons stated above, the Board has concluded that even starting from D14, the subject matter of claim 1 according to the main request is based on an inventive step within the meaning of Article 56 EPC.

5. Conclusion

None of the objections raised by the appellant against the main request are convincing. The only remaining appeal of opposer 2 is therefore to be dismissed.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",opposition rejected,opposition rejected,appeal dismissed,"Alfred E.

II. An opposition was filed against the contested patent in its entirety based on the grounds for opposition under Article 100 a) EPC (lack of inventive step), Article 100 b) EPC, and Article 100 c) EPC.

III. The Opposition Division decided to reject the opposition.

IV. In the decision of the Opposition Division, reference was made inter alia to the following documents:

V. In particular, the Opposition Division found the following:

a) Neither the ground for opposition under Article 100 b) EPC nor that under Article 100 c) EPC precluded the maintenance of the patent.

b) Both A1/A2 and A6 were to be regarded as equally relevant as the closest prior art. The distinguishing feature was that triazines/toltrazuril and polynuclear iron(III)-polysaccharide complexes are present together in a formulation.

The claimed formulation was inventive, even if no further technical effect for the difference other than the simplification of the treatment regimen was recognized, and the problem to be solved was to provide a formulation that simplifies the administration of both active ingredients.

However, the Opposition Division was of the opinion that a technical effect of improved iron supply in piglets was also demonstrated even with later oral and single administration of the combined active ingredient formulation, and found the claimed formulation inventive also in relation to the problem of providing a formulation that improves the iron supply of piglets even with later, single administration of both active ingredients in a formulation. Thus, the ground for opposition under Article 100 a) EPC did not preclude the maintenance of the patent.

VII. The opponent (appellant) filed an appeal against the decision of the Opposition Division. In the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant referred to the newly submitted documents A072-A081 and argued that the invention was not disclosed in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for a person skilled in the art to carry it out and that the claimed subject matter lacked inventive step.

VIII. In a letter dated September 26, 2019, the patent holder (respondent) requested to expedite the proceedings in view of pending infringement proceedings.

IX. In the response to the appeal filed on March 17, 2020, the respondent defended the contested patent according to its main request in the granted form, alternatively based on one of the auxiliary requests 1-7 submitted with the letter dated June 8, 2018. It submitted documents A82-A94.

X. In a letter dated March 18, 2020, CEVA Animal Health AB (hereinafter the intervener) stated that it was joining the opposition proceedings. The intervener submitted documents A095-A096 to prove a lawsuit filed against it before the first-instance Patent and Market Court of Stockholm regarding infringement of the contested patent. Furthermore, the intervener submitted, among other things, the same documents A072-A081 referred to by the appellant. The intervention was based on the grounds for opposition under Article 100 a) EPC (lack of inventive step) and Article 100 b) EPC.

XI. On March 30, 2020, the Board informed the parties of the intervention and set a deadline of four months for a response from the respondent.

XII. On April 17, 2020, the Board explained its preliminary opinion in a communication pursuant to Article 15 (1) RPBA 2020.

XIII. In a submission dated July 22, 2020, the appellant submitted further documents A097-A104.

In its response to the intervention dated August 10, 2020, the respondent submitted further documents A29a and A105-A119 as well as auxiliary requests 1-19.

The further documents A120-A123, A124-A127, and A128 and A129 / A129a were submitted with the submission of the intervener dated August 17, 2020, the submission of the appellant dated August 31, 2020, and the submission of the intervener dated September 7, 2020.

XIV. An oral hearing took place before the Board on September 17, 2020. At the end of the oral hearing, the requests were as follows:

The appellant and the intervener requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

The respondent requested the dismissal of the appeal.

XV. The submissions of the appellant and the intervener can be summarized as follows:

a) Closest prior art

Brochure A072 should be regarded as the closest prior art. A072 discloses the treatment of coccidiosis in piglets through a single administration of the toltrazuril-containing ""Baycox 5%"". According to A072, this oral toltrazuril formulation can be used together and simultaneously with either parenteral or oral iron preparations for the simultaneous treatment of anemia and coccidiosis during the first week of the piglet's life.

Although A072 does not explicitly mention polynuclear iron(III)-polysaccharide complex compounds, these iron compounds are the most commonly used class of iron preparations.

b) Difference and technical effect

The difference between the claimed subject matter and the separate administration of both preparations described in A072 (hereinafter: co-administration) lies in the fact that both active ingredients are present together in a formulation (hereinafter: co-formulation).

No technical effect can be recognized for this difference, except that the co-formulation simplifies the administration of both active ingredients.

From the experimental data of the patent, particularly Table 5, no conclusion can be drawn about the effect of the distinguishing feature. Given A6, A40/A41, A073A/A073B, A074A/A074B, and A075, there is no prejudice in the prior art against later oral administration of the iron(III)-polysaccharide complex iron dextran. It is known that commercially available iron dextran preparations are also effective when administered after the first day of life of the piglet. Moreover, the claimed oral formulation is less effective for the treatment of anemia than the preparations of the prior art.

None of the further evidence submitted by the respondent is suitable to demonstrate a technical effect attributable to the distinguishing feature.

A29 does not contain a comparison to the oral co-administration of the closest prior art A072. The study groups in A29 differ not only by co-administration versus co-formulation but also by the dose of iron. Due to the proven influence of the dose of iron in A51 and A100, any improved weight gain and hematological parameters observed in A29 cannot be attributed to the co-formulation.

A49 and A50 are also unconvincing. First, the doses of toltrazuril in A49 and A50 are significantly below the usual doses of 20 mg/kg. Furthermore, the analysis A63 shows that no statistically significant improvement arises from the co-formulation. On the contrary, A33 (Part B), A28, A43, and A076 show that no technical effect exists across the entire claimed range.

The molecular interaction observed in A092 between toltrazuril and gleptoferron is not relevant for veterinary application.

Likewise, A108 does not demonstrate an effect for the claimed co-formulations, particularly because the study groups already exhibited different values before treatment and were treated with different iron compounds.

Furthermore, the patent claims should be interpreted restrictively to oral formulations, as the description only concerns oral formulations, and because parenteral toltrazuril formulations are neither known in the prior art nor sufficiently disclosed in the patent. Consequently, experimental data on injectable co-formulations should not be considered for assessing inventive step. Even if an effect for injectable co-formulations were recognized, this effect cannot be extrapolated to oral co-formulations and thus does not apply to the entire claimed subject matter.

c) Technical problem and obviousness of the solution

Consequently, the problem is to provide an alternative and simplified administration form for the known iron supplements and antiparasitic active ingredients.

Based on the general knowledge reflected in A46, the skilled person would solve this problem without inventive effort by combining both active ingredients in a formulation and would expect a simplification of administration. Given A6, A40/A41, A073, A074, and/or A075, it was clear and foreseeable to the skilled person that iron dextran administered on the third day of the piglet's life would provide adequate protection against anemia. The respondent has not proven that the claimed co-formulation exceeded this expected effect.

XVI. The submissions of the respondent can be summarized as follows:

a) Disclosure of A072:

A072 does not disclose co-administration of toltrazuril and iron dextran at the same time and via the same route of administration.

First, A072 does not specifically disclose iron dextran but merely provides a general reference to iron preparations.

Furthermore, A072 is limited to addressing the treatment of piglets against coccidiosis and iron deficiency anemia as two separate problems in separate ways. The two problems are not solved simultaneously, but the solutions are only placed in a temporal context to each other, namely within the first week of life of the piglet relevant for the prevention of iron deficiency and coccidiosis.

Moreover, in A072, the treatment of piglets with iron supplementation and with the Baycox® preparation occurs via two different routes of administration. This is shown by the illustration in A072 of a drench gun for the oral application of ""Baycox® 5% oral suspension"" alongside an injection gun for the intramuscular administration of the iron preparations.

This illustration reflects the general knowledge that iron supplementation at the time of administration of ""Baycox® 5% oral suspension"" (namely on the 3rd to 5th day of the piglet's life) is standardly performed via parenteral administration of ""iron"".

b) Difference

The feature that distinguishes the contested patent from the teaching of A072 lies in the co-formulation. A co-formulation necessarily includes two features, namely administration via the same route and the absolute simultaneity of the administration of the active ingredients. Both features represent differences from A072.

c) Technical effect

Table 5 of the patent shows that the (oral) administration of the claimed joint formulation on the 3rd day after birth allows the prevention of iron deficiency anemia until weaning (day 21 after the birth of the piglet) without further iron administration. This surprising finding contradicts the prevailing teaching that oral administration of polynuclear iron(III)-polysaccharide complex compounds requires an initial dose on the first day of the piglet's life and another dose starting from the second week of life. The same conclusion can also be drawn from A38 and A076.

This teaching that oral administration of iron dextran is time-critical cannot be refuted by A6, A40/A41, A073/A073A, and A074/A074A.

A073A concerns products that contain both iron dextran and an amino acid-chelated iron and therefore does not allow conclusions about the effectiveness of iron dextran alone.

A074A describes that iron dextran is administered twice, namely on day 3 and day 14, and does not provide any indication of its effectiveness with a single administration on day 3. Such an indication is also not found in A6.

The results from A40, dated 1985, represent isolated observations and are of questionable significance. Furthermore, A40 shows that iron dextran has lower effectiveness with later oral administration (namely 72 hours after birth). Additionally, the author of A40 admits that the results of his experiment contradict earlier recognized results.

In summary, none of these documents disclose the single and sole administration of iron dextran later than on day 1 for the effective prevention of iron deficiency anemia until the piglets are weaned from the sow (day 21 after birth).

This surprising improvement in oral iron supplementation with iron dextran can be explained by a molecular interaction with toltrazuril in the co-formulation, as qualitatively evidenced in the experimental report A092.

The studies A29, A33, A49, and A50 (supplemented by the statistical evaluation according to A63 and A64) and A108 further confirm the advantages of the co-formulation in direct comparison with co-administration.

A29/A29a concerns the direct comparison between the co-formulation and the co-administration of toltrazuril and gleptoferron via the parenteral route. Although the treatment groups in the study according to A29 received different amounts of iron, it is evident from A51 and A100 that increasing the iron dosage beyond a certain amount has no further influence on weight development. Thus, the advantages observed in A29 regarding weight gain and iron values cannot be attributed to the different amounts of iron but rather to the co-formulation of the claimed active ingredients.

In A33, the pharmacokinetics of toltrazuril for a parenteral (A33 Part B) and oral (Part A) co-formulation and co-administration were investigated. This study shows a surprisingly higher bioavailability of toltrazuril in the co-formulation with an iron(III) complex.

A49 and A50 concern in vivo studies with Cytoisospora (C.) suis infected piglets. A49 and A50 demonstrate that the combined administration of toltrazuril and gleptoferron in a joint formulation (co-formulation) leads to improved weight gain in piglets compared to the separate administration of toltrazuril and gleptoferron (co-administration), both for oral (see A50) and intramuscular (see A49) application. This is confirmed by the statistical analyses of the data from A49 and A50 presented in A63 and A64. A clear trend in favor of the co-formulation is evident.

A52 demonstrates the improved absorption of toltrazuril in the claimed co-formulation in an animal model (namely rats).

The study according to A108 shows that the orally administered co-formulation is more efficient compared to the corresponding oral co-administration of the two active ingredients and leads to higher amounts of red blood cells (RBC) as well as hemoglobin values (Hb values).

Despite the lack of limitation to oral administration, the technical effect and the resulting advantages are present across the entire breadth of the claim. For the oral advantage is the technical effect and not a technical feature of the claimed formulation (in contrast to its use).

d) Regarding the objective problem of simplification and its solution

The co-formulation also entails a significant simplification in the rearing of piglets.

Consequently, the problem is (at least) to provide a formulation that allows for an improvement in pig rearing, namely a less stressful and more labor-efficient treatment of coccidiosis and the prevention of iron deficiency anemia.

Although the use of toltrazuril and iron dextran, each separately, for the prevention and treatment of coccidiosis and iron anemia in piglets has been common for decades, no one had proposed or developed a co-formulation of the two active ingredients by the priority date of the patent. For the skilled person, it would not have been obvious to provide these two active ingredients, intended for the prevention and treatment of two medically unrelated diseases, namely coccidiosis and iron deficiency anemia, in a single formulation, as he could not rule out unpredictable interactions (see the EMA guidelines A094 as well as A61, A22, A094, A105-A107, and A46). Due to the prevailing opinion at the priority date of the contested patent, the skilled person would have assumed that an orally administered iron(III)-polysaccharide complex would no longer be sufficiently effective for the prevention of iron deficiency anemia at the relevant time for the administration of toltrazuril (from the 3rd to the 5th day of the piglet's life). Therefore, the skilled person would have had significant concerns regarding the co-formulation and the oral administration of iron(III)-polysaccharide complexes at this late time. The co-formulation of both active ingredients could therefore not have been obvious regardless of any further possible pharmacological advantages.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Admissibility of the Accession

The Acceding Party has submitted documents A095-A096, which show that a lawsuit for infringement of the disputed patent was filed against it by the Respondent before the first-instance Patent and Market Court in Stockholm. The complaint was served to the Acceding Party on December 27, 2019. The accession declared on March 18, 2020, thus occurred within the 3-month period of Rule 89(1) EPC. The Acceding Party is a third party within the meaning of Article 105(1) EPC, i.e., a legal entity separate from the Appellant. Furthermore, the accession is sufficiently justified, and the required fees have been paid. Thus, the accession meets the requirements of Article 105(1)(a) and Rule 89 EPC.

2. Admission of Documents A072-A0129a and A29a into the Proceedings

2.1 The documents submitted with the admissible accession (A072-A081, A095, and A096, with A072-A081 also submitted with the statement of appeal) as well as the documents submitted with the statement on the accession within the deadline set by the Board (A29a and A105-A119) are part of the proceedings and do not require separate admission. With regard to the documents submitted with the response to the appeal, the Board saw no reason to exercise its discretion under Article 12(4) RPBA.

2.2 The admission of documents submitted after the statement of appeal, response to the appeal, accession, and statement on the accession is to be assessed at the discretion of the Board according to Article 114(2) EPC and the relevant articles of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal, in particular Article 13 RPBA 2007 applicable in this case. The criteria listed in Article 13(1) are not exhaustive.

2.3 The present case is characterized by the special procedural situation arising from the connection of the accelerated procedure with the accession declared in March of this year. This led to a very rapid exchange of documents with a number of newly submitted documents. Since this exchange occurred within the framework to be discussed and the parties have engaged intensively with its content, the documents were admitted into the proceedings.

3. Main Request (Patent in Granted Form), Inventive Step

3.1 Technical Field of the Invention

Claim 1 of the disputed patent relates to a formulation containing triazines of formulas (I) or (II) or their physiologically acceptable salts, and polynuclear iron(III)-polysaccharide complex compounds. The purpose of the invention is to provide formulations suitable for the simultaneous treatment of coccidiosis and iron deficiency conditions in animals (see disputed patent, [0001]).

Coccidiosis and iron deficiency conditions are two typical diseases or deficiency states that occur in piglets due to the type of animal husbandry in meat production operations (see [0002] and [0003]).

Coccidiosis represents frequently occurring parasitic infectious diseases in animals. In particular, economically significant infections in pigs with coccidia of the genus Isospora cause piglet diarrhea and reduced weight gain of the piglets (see [0004]). Toltrazuril is a known triazine of formula (I) for the treatment of coccidiosis (e.g., Isospora suis) in pigs (see [0007]-[0021]).

As causes for iron deficiency conditions in newborn piglets, the disputed patent mentions rapid growth in the first days after birth and rapid depletion of the body's iron reserves, which are not sufficiently compensated by external sources (see [0005]). According to the disputed patent, an anemic condition is characterized by a hemoglobin content of the blood of less than 90 g/L. Various iron preparations are known for the prevention of iron deficiency anemia (see [0013]-[0016]), including polynuclear iron(III)-polysaccharide complex compounds such as iron dextran.

The invention (Claim 1) thus relates to a formulation containing two known active ingredients, namely a triazine such as toltrazuril and a polynuclear iron(III)-polysaccharide complex compound such as iron dextran.

3.2 Closest Prior Art A072

3.2.1 Brochure A072 (in Dutch; see also translation A072A) represents the closest prior art.

A072 concerns the formulation Baycox® 5% Oral Suspension. Baycox® contains toltrazuril, i.e., a triazine according to Claim 1. A072 describes the treatment of coccidiosis in piglets by a single oral administration of Baycox® on the 3rd to 5th day of the animal's life. A072 further notes (see pages 8-9; see also translation A072A) that the oral or parenteral administration of iron preparations is a known solution to the problem of anemia in piglets. Furthermore, A072 discloses that the simultaneous administration of Baycox® and iron preparations within the first week of the pigs does not lead to adverse effects.

3.2.2 The Board shares the Respondent's opinion that A072 does not specifically disclose iron dextran but merely provides a general reference to iron preparations.

3.2.3 However, for the reasons outlined below, the Board concludes that A072 discloses a co-administration of toltrazuril and iron preparations at the same time and via the same route.

A072 discloses not only that both Baycox® and the iron preparations are administered within the first week of the pigs but rather that this administration occurs at the same time (see A072, page 9, and translation A072A: ""These tests show that Baycox 5% Oral Suspension, which is administered at the same time as iron preparations, does not lead to adverse effects on the productivity or health of piglets"", emphasis added; in the Dutch language used in A072: ""gelijktijdig"").

Regarding the administration routes of this co-administration, A072 generally mentions the known oral and parenteral administrations of iron preparations (see A072A, ""the administration of iron preparations via injection or in the mouth is simply routine""). A072 then discloses the simultaneous administration of Baycox® 5% oral suspension and iron preparations without specifying the administration route of the iron preparations. Thus, A072 discloses two alternatives, namely the simultaneous administration of oral toltrazuril and oral iron preparations as well as the simultaneous administration of oral toltrazuril and parenteral iron preparations. The illustration (see A072, page 8) of a drench gun (for the oral application of Baycox® 5% oral suspension) next to an injection gun (for the parenteral administration of iron preparations) illustrates one of these alternatives without limiting the disclosure of A072.

3.2.4 Contrary to the Respondent's opinion, this understanding of the disclosure of A072 does not contradict any general teaching at the priority date regarding iron supplementation.

According to the Respondent (see also paragraphs [0016] and [0024] of the patent), polynuclear iron(III)-polysaccharide complex compounds were mainly administered parenterally and only to a lesser extent orally. In the case of oral administration of polynuclear iron(III)-polysaccharide complex compounds, particularly iron dextran, adequate efficacy could only be achieved if the iron dextran was administered to the piglets within the first hours of life. The Respondent thus holds the view that at the relevant time in A072, namely when administering ""Baycox® 5% oral suspension"" on the 3rd to 5th day of the piglets' lives, the administration of an iron(III)-polysaccharide complex compound could only occur intramuscularly.

The Board cannot follow this argument. Given the state of the art, the skilled person could have expected that oral administration of iron dextran on the 3rd to 5th day of the piglets' lives would be less effective than parenteral administration or earlier administration. However, adequate efficacy was also indicated for oral administration in the state of the art (see statement A078, page 6, paragraphs 25-26; pages 10-13).

For instance, A074A (see translation A074B; Table 1 and composition) describes that the oral administration of ""Suiferrin - paste,"" a composition containing iron dextran, effectively prevents anemia in piglets when administered on the 3rd and 14th day after birth. Suiferrin contains no other iron-containing active ingredients.

A6 shows that the oral administration of iron dextran on the second day of life is as effective as administration shortly after birth (see page 374, ""Oral iron administration on the second day is effective""). According to A6, earlier studies either found that ""the iron from an iron dextran-containing paste was utilized by the piglets on the 4th day of life just as well as in the first hours of life,"" or that iron dextran was better utilized in the first hours of life than one to three days after birth. A6 further describes (see page 375, 2nd column at the top) that in the case of later oral administration of iron dextran, additional iron should be offered at the latest by the third week. However, A6 does not refer to another administration of iron dextran but to iron in the form of creep feed. Such additional iron supplementation was common practice (see A078, paragraph 23; A078, Annex A, paragraph 36).

A40 (see translation A41) describes the treatment of piglets with oral iron dextran. In Experiment 4, the administration of 100 mg of iron dextran 3 to 8 hours after birth was compared with administration during the period of 72 to 96 hours (see A041, page 3). Two weeks after treatment of piglets, no difference was found between the groups (see A041, page 5 and Table 4). Only 4 weeks after treatment was a significant difference observed between the groups in hemoglobin and Hb values. These results are consistent with A6 and A074A and thus do not represent isolated observations.

The Board does not dispute that according to common practice, oral administration of iron(III)-polysaccharide complex compounds was preferred to be administered within the first hours of life. However, the Board believes that there was no general understanding in the state of the art that oral administration of iron dextran on the 3rd to 5th day of the piglets' lives would be ineffective. For these reasons, the skilled person would not dismiss the oral administration of iron preparations mentioned in A072 on the day of administering toltrazuril (day 3 to 5 after birth) as technically nonsensical. In this context, the possible reduced efficacy compared to parenteral administration or earlier administration, as well as any necessary second administration after a few weeks, play no role in the interpretation of A072.

3.2.5 In summary, A072 describes as one of two options the co-administration of oral toltrazuril and oral iron preparations at the same time and via the same administration route.

3.3 Difference

3.3.1 The subject matter of Claim 1 differs from the co-administration of triazines and iron preparations described in A072 in that:

- a polynuclear iron(III)-polysaccharide complex compound is chosen as the iron preparation, and

- the triazines and iron preparations are present in a co-formulation.

The Board shares the Respondent's opinion that a co-formulation necessarily leads to two features, namely administration via the same route and the absolute simultaneity of the administration of the active ingredients. However, none of these features constitutes a difference compared to A072.

3.4 Effect

3.4.1 Regarding the selection of polynuclear iron(III)-polysaccharide complex compounds as iron preparations, the Board shares the Acceding Party's opinion that iron dextran is the most common iron supplementation. This was not disputed by the Respondent. Furthermore, the Respondent has not demonstrated any particular technical effect regarding this sole selection.

3.4.2 For the reasons outlined below, the Board concludes that the claimed co-formulation does not lead to any particular effect compared to the co-administration known from A072.

When comparative tests are conducted to demonstrate inventive step with an improved effect across the entire claimed range, the comparison with the closest prior art must be designed such that the alleged advantages or beneficial effects can be convincingly attributed to the distinguishing feature of the invention over the closest prior art.

a) Table 5

According to the Respondent, Table 5 of the patent (see page 31) shows that the (oral) administration of the claimed combined formulation on day 3 after birth allows for the prevention of iron deficiency anemia until weaning (day 21 after the birth of the piglet) without further iron administration. This surprising finding contradicts the teaching that, with oral administration of polynuclear iron(III)-polysaccharide complex compounds, an initial dose on the first day of the piglet's life and a further dose from the second week of life are required.

The Board does not share this view. Table 5 shows the results of the oral administration on day 3 after birth of toltrazuril/iron dextran co-formulations according to Claim 1 (see formulations according to Examples 2 and 3). This table shows that this treatment leads to Hb values that remain above 9 g/100ml on day 21 (namely 10.78 and 11.61 g/100ml), i.e., under the conditions of these experiments, to an effective prevention of anemia. However, in Table 5, these claimed oral co-formulations are not compared with a corresponding co-administration via the same administration route, but only with the parenteral administration of iron dextran (without toltrazuril). The oral administration on the 3rd day of the claimed iron dextran-containing co-formulation proves to be less effective than the parenteral administration of iron dextran (Hb value 12.51 g/100ml on day 21). These results correspond to the teaching of the state of the art (see 3.2.4 above), according to which the oral administration of iron dextran preparations on days 3 to 5 is indeed less effective than parenteral administration but not ineffective. Table 5 does not provide a direct comparison between co-administration and co-formulation. Therefore, it does not convincingly show that under directly comparable conditions, co-administration requires an additional dose of iron, while co-formulation does not.

The conclusion claimed by the Respondent cannot be drawn from A38 or A076 either. A38 (see page 5, paragraph ""Dose rates"") and A076 (see ""Abstract"") do not contain a direct comparison between a claimed co-formulation and a corresponding simultaneous co-administration via the same administration route. In contrast, A38 (see Figures 3-7) and A076 (see Table 4) show that a claimed oral co-formulation is less effective than the combination of oral toltrazuril and parenteral iron dextran.

b) A29/A29a

According to the Respondent, A29 shows that the co-formulation of the claimed active ingredients leads to advantages in both weight gain and iron values compared to co-administration.

A29 (and the correction A29a submitted with the Respondent's letter of August 10, 2020) concerns a comparison between the co-formulation and the co-administration of toltrazuril and gleptoferron via the parenteral route. Below is a summary of the treatment scheme from A29, as presented on page 17 of the Appellant's letter of July 22, 2020, based on Table 2 and with the amounts of iron calculated from the piglet weights in Table 4. The correction A29a only concerns an error in the numbering of the study groups in the tables and does not change the conclusion of the Board.

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPH

From this tabular summary, it is evident that the piglets treated with the co-formulation received a higher amount of iron, namely 265 mg and 258 mg (Groups 2 and 3; corrected to Groups 1 and 2 in A29a), while the control animals (Group 4; corrected to Group 3 in A29a) received only 200 mg. Consequently, the contentious question is whether the alleged effects regarding weight gain (see A29, Table 4) and iron values (see Tables 5-8) can be attributed to the distinguishing feature (co-formulation versus co-administration) despite these differing amounts of iron.

Based on documents A51 and A100, the Appellant argues that an increase in iron administration beyond a certain amount has no further influence on weight development. Therefore, the increased relative weight gains observed in A29 cannot be attributed to the differing amounts of iron. The Board cannot follow this argument. Due to the differing designs of the studies in A51 and A100, no conclusions can be drawn from these documents regarding the influence (or absence thereof) of administering increased amounts of iron on weight gains or iron parameters within the framework of the studies of A29. In particular, the animals in the study according to A29 were not given any iron-containing supplementary feed (creep feed), unlike the studies according to A51 (see Table 1) and A100 (see page 3, penultimate paragraph).

Regarding the beneficial effect on the iron parameters of the claimed co-formulation compared to co-administration, the Respondent further refers to the graphical representation A109 of the values of study groups 1-4 from Table 5 of A29a.

However, the Board believes that none of the comparisons made by the Respondent (study groups 1 and 2 versus study groups 3 and/or 4; study group 3 versus study group 4; study group 1 versus study group 2; see paragraphs [67]-[81] of the submission of August 10, 2020) is significant. In particular, study groups 1 and 2 according to A29a differ from study groups 3 and 4 by the amounts of iron and by a co-formulation instead of a co-administration or by the presence of toltrazuril. Consequently, no conclusions can be drawn from either A29a or its graphical representation A109 regarding the effect of the sole co-formulation. The Board shares the opinion of the Appellant and the Acceding Party that the longer-lasting high Hb values observed by the Respondent in the co-formulation groups 1 and 2 can be better explained by the increased amounts of iron.

c) A33, A34

In A33, Part A, the pharmacokinetic results for the oral administration of the co-formulation of the invention are presented (see Table 4, page 6). However, this co-formulation is not compared with a co-administration of toltrazuril and iron dextran but with the sole oral administration of toltrazuril.

In A33, Part B, the clinical study was conducted as in A29 (see A22, page 7), i.e., the test groups were administered different amounts of iron (see b) above).

In A34, the parenteral administrations of toltrazuril with and without iron compounds are compared.

Thus, neither A33 nor A34 can demonstrate an effect that can convincingly be attributed to the distinguishing feature of the invention over A072 (namely the co-formulation).

d) A50

In the in vivo study A50, four groups of eight to ten piglets infected with Cytoisospora (C.) suis were treated with the following oral co-administrations or oral co-formulations (see A50, page 3):

- Study Group B: Co-administration of 5 mg/kg toltrazuril and 100 mg/kg iron

- Study Group C: Co-administration of 7.5 mg/kg toltrazuril and 100 mg/kg iron

- Study Group D: Co-formulation of 5 mg/kg toltrazuril and 100 mg/kg iron

- Study Group E: Co-formulation of 7.5 mg/kg toltrazuril and 100 mg/kg iron.

Report A49 refers to a similar study for the intramuscular application of the formulations. In A63 and A64, the data from A49 and A50 were statistically analyzed.

Accordingly, the amounts of toltrazuril administered in A50 (5-7.5 mg/kg) are significantly lower than the standard dosage (20 mg/kg). In its letter of September 2, 2020 (see paragraph [22]), the Respondent stated that these trials were each designed as such, and the respective dosages were chosen to show the most significant group difference compared to the corresponding co-administration of the active ingredients for each administration route.

Despite this optimized dosage, however, no statistically significant difference arises between co-administration and co-formulation, as evident from the statistical data of A63 and A64. The relevant data (AUC0-8 and AUC0-29, each with standard deviations) of A63 are summarized below as on page 27 of the Appellant's letter of July 22, 2020.

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPH

It is evident that these pharmacokinetic values lie within one standard deviation of each other. This is also shown in A64 (see Figures 3 and 4) by the fact that the confidence intervals extend significantly below the equality line.

In this regard, the Board would like to emphasize that a party submitting experimental data is neither obliged to conduct a statistical analysis of these data nor to meet fixed statistical rules. In determining whether a particular technical effect claimed by a party has been achieved, the EPO must apply the general principle of free evaluation of evidence (see G 1/12, OJ 2014, A114, point 31; see also T 2717/17, Reasons 4.3.5).

Nevertheless, in the present case, the Board must consider not only the low statistical relevance of the files but also the unrealistically optimized amounts of active ingredients. It is to be expected that the hardly visible effects at low toltrazuril dosages would occur even less or possibly not at all at standard dosages. For these reasons, the Board concludes that A50 does not show a clear improvement in the pharmacokinetics of toltrazuril through the co-formulation for oral administration.

e) A108

In A108, the efficiency of an orally applied co-formulation is examined in comparison with an oral co-administration. In Group I (control group), the piglets were treated with a co-administration of 20 mg/kg body weight toltrazuril and 91.2 mg/kg body weight ursoferron (containing iron dextran (gleptoferron)). In Group II, the piglets received a co-formulation of 20 mg/kg body weight toltrazuril and 91.2 mg/kg body weight iron dextran. In both groups, the treatment of the animals was administered orally on the 3rd day of the piglets' lives (i.e., on day D0).

The results are summarized as in Table 1 of A108 (page 6, amounts of red blood cells (RBC)) and in the corrected table (hemoglobin values) submitted with the letter of September 3, 2020:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPH

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPH

The Board shares the opinion of the Appellant and the Acceding Party that the results in the two groups are not directly comparable for the following reasons.

While the piglets in Group II were treated with iron dextran, the piglets in Group I received a different iron preparation, namely gleptoferron, which is an iron(III)-hydroxide-dextran-glucoheptonic acid complex (see expert opinions A124 and A128). The Respondent has not disputed that different iron preparations were administered to both groups. The Respondent has also not shown that this difference in iron preparations has no impact on the results of the experiments described in A108. This is also not proven in the documents A114-A117 submitted by the Respondent: A114-A117 merely attempt to show that the group of iron(III)-dextranes also includes gleptoferron.

Furthermore, Groups I and II already had different RBC and hemoglobin values before treatment. The control group I is already characterized on D-2 and D0 by significantly lower RBC and hemoglobin values than the claimed group II. A discussion about the procedure for randomization of the groups is unnecessary, as the groups I and II generated by this procedure are different.

Consequently, A108 does not convincingly show that any improvements observed in A108 in Group II compared to control group I can be attributed to the distinguishing feature of the claimed co-formulation over the co-administration known from A072.

f) A49, A092

With A49, the Respondent attempts to demonstrate an improvement in the pharmacokinetics of toltrazuril through the co-formulation for parenteral administration in a manner similar to A50 (see d) above). The question of whether A49 convincingly shows the claimed improvement can remain open, as the proof of this effect does not apply to the entire claimed subject matter.

Contrary to the Respondent's opinion, oral administration and parenteral administration do not only represent different uses of the same claimed subject matter but require separate features of the formulation itself. For example, a parenteral formulation should have a suitable viscosity (see A085, page 2; see also A078, Annex D, points 37-45). Since the claims are not limited to a parenteral formulation, any effects that occur only with parenteral administration cannot be used for the formulation of the technical problem, as they do not necessarily occur with oral administration.

In the in vitro study A092, the molecular interaction between toltrazuril and iron dextran (gleptoferron) is investigated using a colorimetric method and emission spectroscopy.

Based on A092, the Respondent argued that the interaction between toltrazuril and iron dextran in the co-formulation could explain the improvement of the pharmacological properties for both oral and parenteral administration. However, the Board believes that no connection has been demonstrated between the alleged molecular interaction and the claimed improvement. A092 cannot be used to extrapolate any effects claimed for injectable compositions to oral compositions, nor to show such an effect or improvement per se.

3.4.3 In summary, no improvement has been demonstrated that arises from the distinguishing feature across the entire claimed range, except for the simplification of the treatment scheme.

3.5 Technical Problem

The problem is to provide a formulation that allows for an improvement in pig farming, namely a more stress-free and labor-economical treatment of coccidiosis and the prevention of iron deficiency anemia.

That this problem is solved by the claimed subject matter is not disputed among the parties.

3.6 Obviousness of the Solution

3.6.1 The Board agrees with the Appellant and the Acceding Party that the skilled person would solve the problem without inventive input by the claimed combination of both active ingredients in a formulation for the following reasons.

The relevant field of economic pig farming is characterized by intensive management. The skilled person was thus aware of the need for minimal labor and time expenditure in treating piglets.

For the standard treatment of coccidiosis and the prevention of iron deficiency anemia, A072 already proposes the co-administration of toltrazuril and iron preparations at the same time and via the same (oral) route. Furthermore, A072 discloses that this simultaneous administration does not lead to negative effects.

Therefore, starting from A072, the skilled person would aim for the administration of a fixed combination of both active ingredients to carry out the known separate administration in a single, simplified operation.

This is confirmed by the EMA guidelines on veterinary products (A46). A46 discloses that the administration of a combination of active ingredients can be advantageous in a clinical situation. In particular, A46 mentions a simplification of the treatment scheme (see A46, point 4.3.3). Consequently, starting from A072, in light of the general expertise reflected in A46, a fixed combination of the claimed active ingredients is obvious.

The Respondent holds the view that the skilled person would have only considered a combination of active ingredients for identical or at least pathologically related therapeutic indications. The Board is not convinced by this. Contrary to the Respondent's opinion, the veterinary product guidelines A46 do not contain such a restriction. The guidelines submitted by the Respondent A094, on the other hand, do not refer to veterinary products but to human medicines. In any case, the skilled person would not have shied away from a toltrazuril-iron preparation combination, even if anemia and coccidiosis were considered unrelated diseases, because the combined treatment of these diseases has already been proposed in A072. Due to the absence of negative effects mentioned in A072, no unforeseen interactions were to be expected.

3.6.2 The Board is also convinced that the skilled person would have chosen iron dextran as the most common iron supplementation as iron preparations. The possible disadvantages and prejudices claimed by the Respondent do not change this conclusion.

Initially, the Board does not share the Respondent's opinion that the oral administration of iron(III)-polysaccharide complex compounds such as iron dextran at the time of toltrazuril administration (3rd to 5th day) contradicted the prevailing teaching at the priority date.

The Respondent claims that the absorption of iron(III)-polysaccharide complexes like iron dextran was known to be time-critical, i.e., iron dextran should be administered before gut closure (""gut-closure"") within the first 10-12 hours to be absorbed in the small intestine via pinocytosis. For the reasons mentioned above, the Board finds that it was predictable for the skilled person that iron dextran administered on the 3rd day of the piglets' lives would lead to adequate protection against anemia at least for the first 2 weeks (see 3.2.4). Thus, there was no prevailing teaching at the priority date that oral administration of iron(III)-polysaccharide complex compounds on the 3rd to 5th day would be ineffective.

The Respondent further refers to the teaching that a second administration would be necessary with oral administration of iron dextran to effectively prevent anemia. However, the Respondent has not shown that the claimed co-formulation overcomes such prejudice, i.e., that under directly comparable conditions, co-administration requires an additional dose of iron, while co-formulation does not (see 3.4.2 a) above). In other words, it has not shown that the expected disadvantages of the claimed co-formulation do not occur.

Equally unconvincing is the Respondent's argument that the dosing accuracy of toltrazuril (20 mg/kg body weight) would appear critical to the skilled person, and therefore the skilled person would have deemed toltrazuril unsuitable for a fixed combination with a second active ingredient. Here, the Respondent has not shown that this alleged disadvantage did not actually exist, and that it - if it did exist - was avoided by the claimed co-formulation.

3.6.3 The Respondent further argued that no one had proposed or developed a co-formulation of the two active ingredients until the priority date of the patent, although the use of toltrazuril and iron dextran, each separately, for the prevention and treatment of coccidiosis and iron anemia in piglets has been common for decades. However, the Board notes that the starting point of the present reasoning regarding the lack of inventive step, namely the disclosure of a simultaneous co-administration of toltrazuril and iron preparations via the same administration route, was already given in A072 from 2003. Therefore, the time between the date of disclosure of this co-administration and the priority date cannot serve as an indication of inventive step.

3.7 Consequently, the subject matter of the main request does not involve an inventive step.

I. European Patent No. 2 107 902 (hereinafter: the Patent) was granted with four claims.

The independent claim 1 of the granted patent reads:

""Method for treating keratin fibers, characterized in that a composition containing an active ingredient complex comprising argan oil and shea butter is applied to the keratin fibers and is rinsed out after a contact time of a few seconds up to 45 minutes.""

II. Two oppositions were filed against the grant of the patent. The grounds for opposition included lack of novelty, lack of inventive step, and the exclusion of patentability of a method for therapeutic treatment under Article 100 a) EPC, insufficient disclosure under Article 100 b) EPC, and impermissible extension under Article 100 c) EPC.

III. The appeal of Opponent 02 (Appellant) was directed against the interim decision of the Opposition Division that the patent, taking into account the amendments made in the opposition proceedings according to Auxiliary Request 1, met the requirements of the Convention. The decision was based on the granted patent and Auxiliary Request 1 submitted on February 8, 2019.

Auxiliary Request 1 differed from the granted subject matter in that claim 1 defined the applied composition as a cosmetic composition.

IV. In the opposition proceedings, the following evidence was submitted, among others:

D1: STIMU-TEX AS Fact Sheet; Internet publication

D4: WO01/37792 A2

D5: FR2880277 A1

D6: DE202004006865U1

D7: EP1704897 A1

D8: US6056947

D11: US6045779

V. In the contested decision, the Opposition Division reached the following conclusions:

a) The document D11, submitted after the opposition period, was admitted into the proceedings due to its prima facie apparent relevance.

b) The subject matter of granted claim 1 represented an impermissible generalization compared to the content of the submitted application, which exclusively referred to cosmetic compositions.

c) The subject matter claimed in Auxiliary Request 1 did not include an extension compared to the originally filed application.

This subject matter was novel with respect to the cited prior art and did not constitute a method for therapeutic treatment.

d) The subject matter of Auxiliary Request 1 was sufficiently disclosed.

e) The closest prior art was the method according to document D11. The method claimed in Auxiliary Request 1 differed from the method known from document D11 by the use of shea butter in combination with argan oil. With regard to the experimental results mentioned in the patent, improved properties could be attributed to this combination compared to the individual components. As a solution to the problem of providing an improved method for treating keratin fibers, the claimed method was not obvious to the skilled person. None of documents D1 and D4-D7 provided an incentive to specifically combine shea butter and argan oil in anticipation of enhanced hair treatment effects.

Starting from the shea butter and argan oil-containing skin care compositions of document D4, the skilled person would not assume that an effective hair treatment as claimed in the patent would even be possible.

Thus, the subject matter of Auxiliary Request 1 also involved an inventive step.

VI. In the statement of grounds of appeal, the Appellant only contested the findings of the Opposition Division regarding sufficient disclosure and inventive step.

VII. In the response to the appeal, the Respondent (Patent Holder) maintained Auxiliary Request 1 from the first instance proceedings as the main request, submitted Auxiliary Requests 1-3, and introduced the following new evidence:

D12: <https://www.mueller.de/p/loreal-paris-anti-falten-expertefeuchtigkeitspflege-65-vitamin-komplex-2276966/>

D13: <https://www.parfumdreams.de/LOreal-Professionnel/Serie-Expert/Absolut-Repair-Lipidium>

D14: Comparative tests from the submission of March 23, 2010.

VIII. The further Opponent 1 involved in the appeal proceedings did not provide any comments during the appeal proceedings.

IX. By summons dated July 12, 2021, the Board invited the parties to an oral hearing.

In its communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA 2020 dated August 5, 2021, the Board communicated its preliminary assessment that the amended patent according to the main request met the requirements of sufficient disclosure and inventive step.

The oral hearing was held on May 19, 2022, as a video conference.

X. The relevant arguments of the Appellant for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) Sufficient Disclosure

The term ""complex"" in ""active ingredient complex"" is not further defined in the patent. Therefore, the conventional meaning of the term ""complex"" in the field of chemistry should be applied. According to the conventional meaning, it refers to a polyatomic entity ""MLn"" consisting of a central atom or ion M, usually a metal cation, surrounded by n atoms, molecules, or ions L, which are electron donor groups and are referred to as ligands. It is not apparent to the skilled person how such an entity can be produced from the claimed components based on the teaching of the patent.

b) Inventive Step

The Opposition Division incorrectly considered document D11 instead of document D4 as the closest prior art. Document D4 already describes the use of cosmetic compositions containing shea butter and argan oil, which are also suitable for revitalizing nails and enriching hair. Document D4 thus also refers to the caring treatment of keratin fibers. The difference of the claimed subject matter from this prior art only concerns the definition of the contact time until rinsing. However, this feature is not associated with a special effect and therefore arises as an obvious alternative based on general technical knowledge, possibly taking into account document D11, which already describes rinsing after a short contact time for shea butter-containing hair care products.

The difference between the claimed subject matter and the hair care method known from document D11 only concerns the addition of argan oil. The results reported in the patent from comparative tests do not demonstrate any special effects of this addition, as there are no indications of significance. The skilled person would consider the addition of argan oil as an obvious alternative since the combination of shea butter and argan oil for hair care was already known from document D4.

XI. The relevant arguments of the Respondent for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) Sufficient Disclosure

In the field of cosmetics, it is common to refer to a combination of different active ingredients as a ""complex."" Such an understanding is also evident from documents D12 and D13, in which L'Oréal advertises cosmetic compositions under the designation ""complex."" The skilled person in the field of cosmetics thus understands that the active ingredient complex defined in the claims does not refer to a special entity in the sense of complex chemistry. However, it is clearly stated in the patent that the terms ""active ingredient combination"" and ""active ingredient complex"" are used interchangeably.

b) Inventive Step

The patent is directed to finding improved methods for caring for hair. Document D4 describes compositions for treating skin. Although document D4 mentions effects on hair in some cases, these do not constitute hair treatment in the sense of the patent. Document D11 describes hair care compositions, but the document is more concerned with reducing skin irritations rather than improving hair care efficacy. Document D8, on the other hand, focuses on providing improved combinations for hair care and should therefore be considered as the closest prior art.

The difference between the claimed subject matter and documents D8 and D11 concerns the combination of the components argan oil and shea butter. The patent demonstrates in the examples the synergistic effect of the combination of argan oil and shea butter. This effect is further supported by the results in document D14. The solved problem is the provision of an improved method for hair care. There is no indication in the prior art that points to the claimed subject matter as a solution to this problem. The skilled person would have no reason to incorporate the skin care compositions according to document D4 based on the hair care described in document D11.

The arguments of the Appellant based on document D11 as the closest prior art, particularly the objection regarding the significance of the results reported in the patent, were raised for the first time during the oral hearing in the appeal proceedings and are therefore not to be considered.

Starting from document D4, the skilled person would have no reason to expect effective hair care when rinsing after a shorter contact time of the described compositions.

XII. The Appellant requested that the contested decision be overturned and the patent be revoked in its entirety.

XIII. The Respondent requested that the appeal be dismissed. In the alternative, it requested that the patent be maintained based on one of the Auxiliary Requests 1-3 submitted with the response to the appeal.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Admission of New Evidence

No objections were raised against the new evidence introduced into the appeal proceedings. The Board also has no concerns, so documents D12-D14 will be taken into account in the proceedings (Article 12(4) RPBA 2007).

Main Request

2. Disclosure of the Invention

The patent describes in paragraphs [0014]-[0019] that a combination of active ingredients containing argan oil and shea butter is used according to the invention, and subsequently defines in paragraph [0021] that the invention relates to the use of a cosmetic composition that includes a complex of active ingredients containing argan oil and shea butter. Accordingly, the patent describes examples using the term ""active ingredient complex"" (see paragraphs [0222]-[0225]) and then presents formulation examples (see paragraph [0226]), which consist of simple combinations of compositions containing argan oil and shea butter. The terms ""active ingredient combination"" and ""active ingredient complex"" are thus used interchangeably in the patent. This use of the term ""complex"" is not uncommon in the field of cosmetics, as shown by documents D12 and D13. The skilled person therefore understands that the active ingredient complex defined in the claims is a simple combination of active ingredients containing argan oil and shea butter, for which the patent provides sufficient guidance for its provision and use.

Consequently, the Board concludes that the patent meets the requirements of Article 83 EPC.

3. Inventive Step

3.1 Closest Prior Art

3.1.1 The Board points out that the problem-solution approach implies (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 9th edition, sections I.D.3.1 to I.D.3.4) that if an inventive step can be recognized based on a certain prior art, which is convincingly identified as the most promising starting point and thus represents the closest prior art, the attempt to deny the inventive step based on a less promising starting point must fail. However, if an inventive step is apparently convincingly denied based on a realistic starting point in the prior art, an argument that the claimed subject matter is still based on an inventive step in light of a supposedly closer prior art is generally not convincing, since in such a case the supposedly closest prior art proves to be less promising.

3.1.2 The patent relates to a method for the care and conditioning of keratin fibers, particularly human hair, which exhibits high efficacy and good compatibility (see, among others, paragraphs [0014]-[0015] and [0020]-[0021]).

Document D11 similarly addresses rinse-off hair care products and describes plant oils such as shea butter as active ingredients (see D11, column 6, line 60 and column 10, lines 26-30). In line with the contested decision, the Board therefore considers document D11 to be the closest prior art for assessing inventive step. The difference from this prior art concerns the application of shea butter in combination with argan oil.

Document D4 describes skin care products that contain shea butter and argan oil (see D4 page 1, lines 20-26) and are preferably applied to washed skin (see page 6, lines 19-22). Although document D4 mentions that the application of the products also has positive effects on hair (see D4, page 6, lines 10-16 and pages 12-13, cases 5 and 7), it does not describe that the products are applied to the hair and rinsed out after a shorter exposure time of up to 45 minutes. As correctly noted in the contested decision (see page 18, section 7.14), the application examples in document D4 indicate a prolonged exposure of the product, with no rinsing being provided at all. Document D4 therefore addresses a fundamentally different problem than the patent. In the Board's view, document D4 does not represent a realistic starting point for the skilled person to arrive at the claimed subject matter.

The document D8 cited by the respondent neither mentions shea butter nor argan oil and is thus clearly more remote from the claimed subject matter than document D11.

3.2 The patent demonstrates through experimental results regarding the melting points of treated hair strands and the evaluation of treated subjects that the claimed use of the combination of active ingredients is associated with an increase in efficacy compared to the use of the individual active ingredients. This increased efficacy is confirmed in document D14.

The appellant first raised the objection during the oral proceedings that the results reported in the patent do not indicate any advantage for the patented hair treatment due to the lack of information regarding their significance. Apart from the fact that no valid reasons were provided for the admission of this amendment to the appellant's submissions in the sense of Article 13(2) RPBA 2020, the Board notes that, in the absence of contrary evidence, there is no reason to doubt the significance of the results reported in the patent.

The objective problem in relation to document D11 is therefore the provision of an improved method for the caring and conditioning treatment of keratin fibers.

3.3 The skilled person derives no indication from the existing prior art that an improved method is provided by the combined use of shea butter and argan oil.

As explained in the above section 3.1, document D4 concerns a fundamentally different application of skin care compositions containing shea butter and argan oil. The skilled person would therefore have no reason to refer to the teaching of document D4 starting from document D11. Furthermore, the application described in document D4 for skin care would not provide the skilled person with any indication of an improvement in the caring and conditioning treatment of keratin fibers with a formulation that is to be rinsed out after a short exposure time.

3.4 The Board also points out that the existing prior art, including document D11, does not provide any reason for the skilled person to expect effective hair care when the skin care products of document D4 are applied to the hair and rinsed out after a shorter exposure time.

3.5 The Board therefore concludes that the patent also meets the requirement of inventive step.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,appeal dismissed,"Revlon Consumer Products Corporation, L'OREAL","Revlon Consumer Products Corporation One New York Plaza New York, NY 10004 / US","Rupp, Christian, et al, et al Mitscherlich PartmbB Patent- und Rechtsanwälte Karlstraße 7 80333 München / DE","L'OREAL 14, rue Royale 75008 Paris / FR","L'Oreal Service D.I.P.I. 9, rue Pierre Dreyfus 92110 Clichy / FR",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. European Patent No. 2 925 284 (hereinafter: the Patent) was granted with eleven claims.

The independent claim 1 of the granted patent reads:

""Means for dyeing keratinous fibers, in particular human hair, comprising in a cosmetic carrier

(a) at least one cationic anthraquinone derivative of the formula (I)

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

wherein R1, R2, R3 independently represent a C1-C6 alkyl group, n represents an integer from 2 to 8, and A**(-) represents a physiologically acceptable anion,

(b) at least one further cationic direct dye that is different from the formula (I),

(c) at least one amphoteric and/or zwitterionic surfactant, and

(d) at least one cationic polymer.""

II. An opposition was filed against the grant of the patent. The grounds for opposition were lack of novelty and lack of inventive step.

The appeal of the opponent (appellant) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to reject the opposition.

III. In the opposition proceedings, the following pieces of evidence were submitted, among others:

D3: US 2006/100114 A1

D4: US 5 891 200 A

D5: US 8 709 102 B2

D14: Technical test report submitted with the letter from the patent owner dated March 28, 2019.

IV. The opposition division reached the following conclusions:

a) The subject matter claimed in the granted patent was novel over the prior art.

b) The patent related to the provision of hair treatment agents that simultaneously provide intense coloring and shine. The closest prior art was document D3, particularly examples 1, 4, and 8, as it also dealt with hair dyes that improve shine.

The difference from this prior art concerned the addition of the cationic direct dye of formula (I).

The results reported in the patent and in document D14 indicated that the addition of the dye of formula (I) could achieve significantly increased shine values. The problem to be solved was thus the provision of hair dyes with improved shine values.

The skilled person would not have considered any of documents D4, D6, D7, D9, D10, or D11 to solve this problem, as these documents did not relate to shine in terms of reflection. Document D5 could not lead to the claimed subject matter as it did not disclose a dye of formula (I). Given the multitude of known blue direct dyes, it was also not obvious to select dyes of formula (I) in light of the hair shine-promoting effect of particularly blue direct dyes known from document D12.

Thus, the subject matter also involved an inventive step.

V. With its statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant submitted the following new evidence:

D15: Comparative tests of the opponent

VI. The respondent (patent owner) objected to the admission of document D15 in its response to the appeal.

VII. By summons dated May 3, 2021, the Board invited the parties to an oral hearing.

In its communication pursuant to Article 15(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA) 2020 dated May 18, 2021, the Board communicated its preliminary assessment that the test results reported in document D14 suggested an increased hair shine-improving effect of the claimed composition compared to example 1 of document D3 and that the test results reported in document D15 did not undermine this assumption.

The oral hearing was held on April 29, 2022, as a video conference.

VIII. The relevant arguments of the appellant for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) Admission of document D15

The submission of document D15 with the statement of grounds of appeal was an appropriate response to the consideration of document D14, which was submitted late in the opposition proceedings.

b) Inventive step

Example 4 of document D3 represented the closest prior art, as this example also related to a means for improving hair shine from a combination of a cationic blue dye, Basic Blue 99, with another cationic dye.

The results reported in the patent and document D14 were not suitable to demonstrate a particular increase in shine values due to the addition of a dye of formula (I).

The test results of document D15 showed that replacing Basic Blue 99 in example 4 of document D3 with a dye of formula (I), HC Blue 16 (also known as Bluequat B), did not result in a significantly better increase in shine when applying the composition (see document D15, page 4, ""Résultats"" for compositions A2/B2). Additionally, the addition of HC Blue 16 in the composition of example 1 of document D3 did not lead to an improvement in shine effect (see document D15, page 2, ""Résultats"" for compositions A1/B1). Furthermore, the test according to document D14 did not include a comparison to example 1 of document D3, as the tested compositions would not contain the fragrance mentioned in that example.

The problem solved thus merely concerned the provision of alternative hair dyeing means. Since compounds of formula (I) were sufficiently known as blue cationic dyes from documents D4, D6, D7, D9, D10, and D11, their use to solve this problem would have been obvious to the skilled person.

Even if one were to assume an improved effect on hair shine compared to the composition of example 1 of document D3, the improved shine effect following the replacement of a red dye with a blue dye would have been obvious to the skilled person, as document D12 already indicated a particular shine effect from the addition of blue dyes in hair care products.

IX. The relevant arguments of the respondent for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) Admission of document D15

The experiments described in document D15 could have already been conducted in the first instance proceedings. The appeal submissions should, according to Article 12(2) RPBA, relate to the requests, facts, objections, arguments, and evidence underlying the contested decision. Document D15 should therefore not be admitted.

b) Inventive step

The patent relates to means that intensely dye the hair and give it a strong shine. Example 1 of document D3 represents the closest prior art, as this example also aims at a significant dyeing of the hair regarding the dye content and demonstrates the effect on hair shine with experimental results. In contrast, example 4 of document D3 concerns a shampoo with only a very low dye content and reports at best similar properties as in example 1.

The results reported in document D14 would show that replacing a dye in example 1 of document D3 with an equal amount of the patented Bluequat B is associated with an enhancement of hair shine. The experiments according to documents D14 and D15 would differ in their experimental setup. However, the results in document D15 would still confirm the effect compared to example 1 of document D3. The further results of document D15 are irrelevant, as they do not compare to the composition of example 4 of document D3, but to a significantly modified composition. The hair shine-enhancing effect from the additional use of Bluequat B is also evident from the test results reported in the patent. The shine effect is not caused by a color effect.

Compared to document D3, the problem is thus seen in providing means with improved effects regarding hair shine. Documents D4, D6, D7, D9, D10, and D11 do not provide any indication of the particular shine effect from the addition of compounds of formula (I). Document D12 relates to a shine impression caused by blue color and does not imply the shine effect of the compounds of formula (I) independent of the final color.

X. The appellant requested that the contested decision be overturned and the patent be revoked in its entirety.

XI. The respondent requested the dismissal of the appeal. Furthermore, it requested that document D15 not be admitted into the appeal proceedings.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Admission of Document D15

Document D15 presents results from comparative tests conducted by the appellant regarding examples 1 and 4 of Document D3.

In the contested decision, the concerns of the appellant regarding the test results reported in Document D14 were dismissed, and in light of these results, the increased gloss values compared to example 1 of Document D3 were assumed to be due to the use of a dye of formula (I) (see Reasons for the Decision, Section 12.3). Document D14 was submitted by the respondent within the deadline set according to Rule 116, but still at a late stage of the opposition proceedings.

Against this background, the Board considers the submission of Document D15 with the appeal as a legitimate response to the contested decision and sees no reason to refuse the admission of Document D15 under Article 12(4) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA) 2007.

2. Novelty

The findings of the opposition division regarding novelty have not been contested by the appellant in the appeal proceedings and are therefore considered undisputed.

3. Inventive Step

3.1 Closest Prior Art

3.1.1 The parties agreed with the contested decision that Document D3 is to be considered as the closest prior art.

3.1.2 Document D3 describes hair care compositions that have both color-enhancing and cleansing effects while improving the gloss, manageability, and smoothness of the hair. These compositions contain, among other things, at least one direct cationic dye (see D3, paragraphs [0005] and [0006] as well as claim 1). The document mentions a number of cationic dyes as examples, including Basic Blue 99, Basic Violet 2, and Basic Red 76 (see D3, paragraph [0013]), and preferably Basic Red 51 (see D3, paragraphs [0014] and [0015], formula I with R**(1)-R**(4) as methyl and Y as chlorine). These dyes are further direct cationic dyes (b) that differ from formula (I) (see the patent, paragraph [0043]).

Document D3 describes in example 1 a shampoo containing 0.09% Basic Red 76 and 0.06% Basic Red 51 as well as 5.0% of the surfactant Cocoamidopropyl Betaine and 0.1% of the cationic polymer Polyquaternium-7. Among other things, a numerically assessed improvement in hair gloss with continuous application by test subjects is reported (see D3, paragraphs [0077] to [0080]).

Example 4 of Document D3 refers to a shampoo containing 0.0001% Basic Blue 99 and 0.000045% Basic Violet 2 as well as 8.0% Cocoamidopropyl Betaine and 0.2% of the cationic polymer Polyquaternium-10. It is generally reported that this shampoo, which results in a color resembling silver, otherwise exhibits properties corresponding to example 1 (see D3, paragraphs [0087] to [0089]).

3.1.3 The claimed compositions differ from this prior art by the use of a dye of formula (I).

3.2 Formulation of the Technical Problem Solved

3.2.1 The patent presents in the experimental part a series of tests with claimed compositions (E1-E4) that contain varying amounts of a compound of formula (I) (Bluequat B / HC Blue 16) along with other cationic dyes (b) of different colors, and for comparison, compositions (V1-V4) that contain only such other cationic dyes (b) (see the patent, paragraphs [0149] and [0153]). The reported results relate to the gloss effect of these compositions on bleached hair strands and show for the claimed compositions a 7- to 8-fold increase in gloss to absolute values between 0.0140 and 0.0174 compared to a 1- to 4.6-fold increase to absolute values between 0.0018 and 0.0092 for the compositions in which the compound of formula (I) was not used.

Document D14 additionally shows that with an appropriate experimental setup, a composition with a similar formulation to example 1 of Document D3 (""Comparison V"") produces an approximately 3.5-fold increase in gloss to a value of 0.0067, while a composition according to the patent (""Invention E""), in which only Basic Red 76 was replaced by an equal weight proportion of Bluequat B (HC Blue 16), results in an approximately 7-fold increase to a value of 0.0134 (see D14, tables on pages 1 and 2).

In the Board's view, these results sufficiently demonstrate that the patented use of a compound of formula (I) enables a particularly pronounced increase in hair gloss compared to the prior art.

3.2.2 The test results of Document D15 do not cast doubt on this effect for the following reasons.

Document D15 describes a comparison between a composition with a similar formulation to example 1 of Document D3 (""Composition A1"") and a composition in which, in addition to the dyes Basic Red 76 and Basic Red 51, the claimed dye HC Blue 16 (Bluequat B) is included in a weight proportion of 0.1% (""Composition B1""). The results reported in Document D15 relate to the gloss effect of the compositions on natural hair strands (""cheveux naturels à 90% blancs"") and show for ""Composition A1"" a 1.13-fold increase in gloss to a value of 0.18 compared to a 1.31-fold increase to a value of 0.21 for ""Composition B1"" (see D15, tables on pages 1 and 2). The differences are described as statistically non-significant.

However, the Board notes that the results of Document D15 still show higher gloss values for the hair treated with the patented composition. The lack of statistical significance of the data from Document D15 does not call into question the particularly pronounced gloss effect demonstrated by the use of a compound of formula (I) as shown in the patent and D14.

Document D15 also describes a comparison between a composition (""Composition A2"") that contains the dyes Basic Blue 99 and Basic Violet 2 used in example 4 of Document D3 in weight proportions of 0.1% and 0.000045%, and a corresponding patented composition (""Composition B2"") that contains 0.1% HC Blue 16 (Bluequat B) instead of Basic Blue 99. For ""Composition A2"", a 1.25-fold increase in gloss to a value of 0.20 is reported compared to a 1.19-fold increase to a value of 0.19 for ""Composition B1"" (see D15, tables on pages 3 and 4). The differences are also described as statistically non-significant.

The Board agrees with the respondent that ""Composition A2"" differs from example 4 of Document D3 by a 1000-fold larger proportion of Basic Blue 99. Therefore, the relevant test of Document D15 does not demonstrate that there is no effect compared to the actual prior art described in Document D3.

Furthermore, the Board notes that the absolute gloss values recorded in Document D15 for the hair strands before treatment (0.16) differ by approximately 80 times from the absolute gloss values (0.002) reported in the patent and Document D14 for untreated hair. This raises questions about whether the experiments in Document D15 and those in the patent and Document D14 relate to a comparable experimental setup. For this reason, the assumption of the increased gloss-enhancing effect due to the claimed use of a dye of formula (I) remains unaffected.

3.2.3 The appellant's argument that compounds of formula (I) are blue dyes and that example 4 of Document D3, due to the presence of the blue cationic dye Basic Blue 99, represents a closer prior art than example 3, which contains only the red dyes Basic Red 76 and Basic Red 51, does not convince the Board.

The patent (see paragraph [0043]) describes the following structures for the relevant dyes:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

Basic Blue 99   Basic Red 76   Basic Red 51.

All relevant dyes of examples 1 and 4 of Document D3 thus have significantly different structures compared to formula (I). Furthermore, the compound of formula (I) is used in conjunction with any other cationic dye according to the patent. Therefore, the gloss increase recorded in the patent and in Document D14 is clearly not a color-related effect. The blue color and the structure of Basic Blue 99 used in example 4 of Document D3 are therefore not decisive indicators for determining the closest starting point.

Moreover, Document D3 describes the advantageous properties of example 1, including the gloss-enhancing effect of example 1, prominently and substantiates these properties with quantitative data (see D3, paragraphs [0077] to [0080]). In contrast, Document D3 only mentions results similar to or corresponding to example 1 for the subsequent examples, including example 4 (see D3, paragraphs [0081] and [0089]). Against this background, the Board has no reason to doubt that the improved gloss effect shown for the patented composition compared to example 1 of Document D3 also results when compared to example 4 of Document D3.

3.2.4 The further argument of the appellant that Document D14 does not represent a comparison of the claimed subject matter with the prior art because a fragrance was used for the composition of example 1 in Document D3, while the compositions tested according to Document D14 do not contain a fragrance, also does not convince the Board.

Document D3 does not suggest in any way that the fragrance contained in example 1 contributes to the gloss effect. There is also no apparent reason to assume that the absence of the fragrance significantly affects the comparison regarding the gloss values in Document D14.

3.2.5 In light of the particular effect shown compared to the prior art, which arises from the patented use of a compound of formula (I), the Board agrees with the contested decision that the technical problem solved is to provide hair coloring agents that are improved in terms of objectively measured gloss values.

3.3 Assessment of the Solution

The improved gloss increase achieved by the patented use of a compound of formula (I) does not emerge in an obvious manner from the existing prior art, in the Board's view.

The cited documents D4, D6, D7, D9, D10, and D11 describe compounds of formula (I) as blue dyes suitable for coloring hair; however, these documents do not indicate any particular gloss-enhancing effect of these compounds.

Document D12 mentions that the use of small amounts of blue dyes in hair care products apparently increases hair gloss (see D12, page 435, lines 15-16). However, this apparent gloss increase, according to Document D12 (see D12, page 435, lines 6-14), is attributed to the color sensitivity of the eye and does not indicate the objective increase in hair gloss achievable through the patented use of a compound of formula (I), which is not color-dependent.

Accordingly, the Board concludes that the granted patent also meets the requirement of inventive step.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",opposition rejected,opposition rejected,appeal dismissed,L'Oréal,"L'Oréal 14, Rue Royale 75008 Paris / FR","L'Oreal, et al, et al Service D.I.P.I. 9, rue Pierre Dreyfus 92110 Clichy / FR",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeal of the opponent is directed against the decision of the opposition division to reject the opposition against patent EP 1 660 022 under Article 101(2) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the contested patent was challenged in its entirety based on Article 100(a) EPC for lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

III. During the opposition proceedings, the following documents were referenced, which are also relevant for the present decision:

D1: EP 1 166 748

D2: J.F. Corbett, J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem., 35, 297-310, 1984

D5: ""APPENDIX: Comparative Test Results for Keratin Coloring Preparations"" (submitted by the patent owner in the opposition proceedings on February 17, 2018)

IV. In its decision, the opposition division concluded that the subject matter claimed in the contested patent was based on an inventive step starting from the technical teaching of document D1 (Article 56 EPC).

V. An appeal was filed by the opponent against this decision. The opponent also maintained in the appeal proceedings that the subject matter claimed in the contested patent did not involve an inventive step, also starting from the technical teaching of document D1 (Article 56 EPC).

VI. In response to the appeal statement, the respondent (patent owner) re-submitted auxiliary requests 1 and 2, which had been presented for the first time during the opposition proceedings. In the same submission, the respondent provided arguments particularly regarding the inventive step of the requests.

VII. On January 26, 2022, the parties were summoned to oral proceedings scheduled for July 25, 2022.

VIII. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the parties were informed of the preliminary opinion of the board. The parties were notified of the board's intention to discuss during the oral proceedings, in particular, to what extent the experimental data of document D5 could demonstrate a technical effect attributable to the distinguishing feature compared to example 65 of document D1. Furthermore, the board referred to the objections raised by the appellant regarding the auxiliary requests under Articles 83, 84, and 56 EPC.

IX. In a submission dated June 7, 2022, the respondent informed that it would not participate in the oral proceedings.

X. Claim 1 of the granted patent (current main request) reads as follows:

""Means for coloring keratin fibers, which is free from chemical oxidizing agents, characterized in that it is in the form of an aqueous or aqueous-alcoholic preparation and contains a combination of oxidizing dyes and direct dyes, wherein at least 3 direct dyes are included and the weight ratio of oxidizing dyes to direct dyes is equal to 5:1 to 0.5:1 and that the direct dyes are selected from hydroxyethyl-2-nitro-p-toluidine, 2-hydroxyethyl-picramic acid, 4-nitrophenyl-aminohamstoff, Basic Violet 2, Disperse Violet 1, HC Blue No. 2, HC Blue No. 12, HC Red No. 13, HC Yellow No. 6, HC Red No. 3, 4-amino-3-nitrophenol, 4-[(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-3-nitrophenol, HC Red No. 10, HC Red No. 11, 2-chloro-6-ethylamino-4-nitrophenol, 2-amino-6-chloro-4-nitrophenol, HC Yellow No. 13, Basic Blue No. 99, Basic Brown No. 16, Basic Brown No. 17, Basic Red No. 76, Basic Yellow No. 57 and 2,6-diamino-3-[(pyridin-3-yl)azo]-pyridine and their salts and that the oxidizing dyes are selected from 2,5-diamino-toluene, 2,4-diaminophenoxyethanol, resorcin, 2-methylresorcin, m-aminophenol, 4-amino-3-methylphenol, 4-amino-2-hydroxy-toluene, 6-amino-3-methyl-phenol, 2-amino-4-hydroxyethylaminoanisole, 1-naphthol, hydroxyethyl-3,4-methylenedioxyaniline, 2,5-diamino-phenylethanol, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-p-phenylenediamine, phenyl-methyl-pyrazolone and 1-hydroxyethyl-4,5-diamino-pyrazole or their salts.""

XI. Claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 differs from claim 1 of the main request in that it additionally includes a feature for selecting the combination of oxidizing dyes and direct dyes, which has the following wording:

""... which is selected such that when using the means, coloring results are obtained that are characterized by a natural shine and a long-lasting even coloring without changing the original color, ..."".

XII. Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 differs from claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 in that it contains another feature for selecting the combination of oxidizing dyes and direct dyes, which has the following wording:

""... and such that a constant color image is achieved that lasts for a period of up to 20 washes of the colored keratin fibers, ..."".

XIII. In its appeal statement and in the further proceedings, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

The means according to claim 1 does not solve the subjective technical problem mentioned in the contested patent. It has not been demonstrated that the final coloring develops immediately after the application of the claimed means for coloring. The opposition division also did not correctly interpret the teaching of document D1, as the document indeed discloses form-stable coloring agents with immediate development of a final color tone.

The appellant also considered the examples described in document D5 to be uninformative. From Table 3 of the document, it is evident only that differences in the compositions (number and type of direct dyes, ratio of oxidizing dyes to direct dyes) led to different coloring results. This is not surprising for the skilled person in view of the respective specific compositions. A temporal progression of color tone development cannot be derived from Table 3. It is also unclear why composition E2 of document D5 is not inventive. Furthermore, Table 2 of document D5 does not provide a temporal progression of the color tone development of the examined compositions, nor are the results presented surprising for the skilled person. Similarly, the values presented in Table 1 of document D5 are not suitable to demonstrate improved wash fastness. Therefore, the technical problem solved was formulated too ambitiously by the opposition division, as it merely lies in providing alternative coloring agents. Their claimed provision is suggested to the skilled person by documents D2 and D3 as well as by general expert knowledge.

Regarding the auxiliary requests, the appellant already stated in the written proceedings, namely in the appeal statement of October 23, 2019, that claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 does not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC. The subject matter claimed therein is not clearly defined. It referred to the feature included in the claim from the description during the opposition proceedings, particularly to the terms ""natural shine"" and ""long-lasting even coloring"" contained therein.

XIV. In its response to the appeal statement, the respondent essentially argued as follows:

The claimed means leads to the desired color being established immediately after application and lasting for a longer period. The respondent specifically referred to paragraph [0005] of the description of the contested patent as well as to the examples of document D5 also cited by the appellant.

The respondent further argued that the features added to the claims of the auxiliary requests do not cause ambiguities and that the definition of claimed subject matter by functional features is generally permissible. Furthermore, auxiliary request 2 specifies the period over which an even coloring occurs.

XV. An oral hearing took place on July 25, 2022, in the form of a video conference. The respondent was not represented as announced.

XVI. Requests

The appellant (opponent) requests the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of European Patent No. 1660022 in its entirety.

The respondent (patent owner) requests in writing that the appeal be dismissed (maintenance based on the granted patent) and, alternatively, the maintenance of the patent based on auxiliary requests 1 or 2, first submitted on April 12, 2019, and re-submitted in the appeal proceedings on March 6, 2020.","Reasons for the Decision

Main Request - Inventive Step

1. In the decision of the opposition division, inventive step was acknowledged based on the disclosure of document D1, particularly example 65. The opposition division justified this by referring to comparative tests from tables 2 and 3 of document D5. From this, they believed a technical effect could be derived, which was attributable to the distinguishing feature over D1, namely the presence of at least one third direct dye from the group mentioned in claim 1 in the claimed composition. The opposition division saw the technical problem solved as providing a composition that allows for a uniform coloration immediately after application, which remains largely constant over a period of up to 20 hair washes. They stated that the skilled person could not derive any specific indication from any of the submitted documents that the claimed combination of dyes allows for a constant coloration over a longer period.

2. The board does not agree with this view and aligns itself with the arguments of the appellant. The reasons for this are as follows:

Closest Prior Art

2.1 Both parties agree, in accordance with the opposition division, that document D1, particularly example 65, is a suitable starting point for assessing inventive step (see table 11 on page 12 of document D1). The hair dye described in example 65 contains, in addition to dyes listed as oxidation dyes in claim 1 of the contested patent (see compounds E7, E8, and K22 in document D1; cf. paragraph [0018], page 5, lines 20 and 23; paragraph [0018], page 4, line 53 in D1), also two of the dyes mentioned in the list of direct dyes in claim 1 of the contested patent (dyes D1 and D2 in document D1; see paragraph [0018], page 5, lines 28 and 30 in D1). In the alternative example 64 referred to by the parties, however, only a single claimed direct dye is included (dye D3 in document D1; see paragraph [0018], page 5, line 31 in D1). The board can therefore agree with the choice of example 65 as the closest prior art. The weight ratio of oxidation dyes to direct dyes in example 65 is also 3.24, which falls within the claimed range of 5:1 to 0.5:1 (example 65 in table 11 of D1: 0.01 + 1.06 + 0.55 = 1.62 parts oxidation dyes and 0.15 + 0.35 = 0.50 parts direct dyes).

Distinguishing Feature

2.2 The composition according to claim 1 of the contested patent thus differs from the composition according to example 65 of document D1 in that it ""... contains at least 3 direct dyes ..."", meaning that at least one additional dye from the list of direct dyes specified in the claim is included. This point was undisputed between the parties.

Technical Effect and Objective Technical Problem

2.3 The parties held differing views on what technical effect is caused by the presence of at least one additional direct dye and how the resulting objective technical problem should be defined. However, both parties based their arguments on the content of document D5.

2.4 The board follows the appellant's arguments for the following reasons:

2.4.1 Tables 1 and 2 of document D5 examine the color change after washing hair dyed with various compositions (A1, A2, B1, B2). The compositions A1 and B1 fall within the claimed range (at least three of the specified direct dyes and the claimed weight ratio, see ""Composition A1"" and ""Composition B1"" on pages 1 and 2 of the document), while compositions A2 and B2 do not. Composition A2 has a weight ratio of oxidation dyes to direct dyes of 6:1 (see page 1 of the document: ""Composition A2""), and composition B2 has a ratio of 0.3:1 (see page 2 of the document: ""Composition B2""). The values are either above or below the claimed range of 5:1 to 0.5:1.

Thus, from tables 1 and 2, it can at most be derived how compositions differ in terms of color stability of dyed hair after washing, whose weight ratio of oxidation dyes to direct dyes lies within or outside the claimed range. A technical effect based on the distinguishing feature identified over example 65 of document D1 - the presence of at least one additional direct dye - cannot be derived from this. All compositions listed and tested in tables 1 and 2 already contain at least 3 different direct dyes (see the list of ingredients of compositions A1, A2, B1, and B2 on pages 1 and 2 of document D5). Therefore, tables 1 and 2 are not suitable to demonstrate a technical effect over example 65 of document D1.

2.4.2 From table 3 of document D5, on the other hand, no temporal progression of the color intensity of the tested dyes is evident. The table rather indicates what coloration can be achieved with the various dyes. The last column of the table states that certain colorations cannot be achieved with specific compositions containing fewer than 3 direct dyes. However, composition E2 also contains three direct dyes (page 7 of D5, ""Composition E2"": direct dyes HC Blue No. 12, HC Red No. 10 / HC Red No. 11 (70/30)). It is therefore also encompassed by the claim wording but apparently does not provide satisfactory colorations (see the last entry in table 3). Thus, the results of the table are at most suitable to show that different dye compositions lead to various colorations of hair. A temporal dependence of the color intensities based on the distinguishing feature over example 65 of document D3 cannot be derived from table 3.

2.5 Therefore, the objective technical problem is to provide alternative means for dyeing keratin fibers that can achieve different shades compared to the dyeing agent disclosed in example 65 of document D1.

Claimed Solution to the Technical Problem

2.6 The technical problem is solved by the claimed composition in that it must contain at least one additional direct dye selected from the list of compounds mentioned in the claim. That this problem is solved was undisputed.

Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

2.7 The skilled person can already derive from document D1 itself that ""to round off the color result and to create special color effects, further conventional oxidation dye precursors ... as well as conventional direct dyes from the group ... aromatic nitro dyes ..."" can be added (paragraph [0009]). Specifically, document D1 proposes the compound D3 (2-Amino-6-chlor-4-nitro-phenol, paragraph [0018], page 5, line 32, as well as table 11, example 64) as an aromatic nitro dye as a direct dye. This is found in the list of direct dyes of claim 1 according to the contested patent.

Therefore, it is considered obvious for the skilled person, taking into account the technical problem posed, to modify example 65 of document D1 by adding at least one additional direct dye contained in the list of claim 1, namely, for example, by adding compound D3. The skilled person would arrive directly at the claimed subject matter through this approach.

3. The provision of a composition for dyeing keratin fibers according to claim 1 of the contested patent is therefore not based on an inventive step. The main request of the respondent is thus not allowable (Article 56 EPC).

Auxiliary Request 1 - Article 84 EPC

4. For the following reasons, the board also follows the arguments of the appellant here:

4.1 Claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 was amended compared to claim 1 of the granted patent by incorporating a feature from the description of the contested patent (page 2, paragraph 2). The appellant's submission relates to the amendment of claim 1 carried out by this newly incorporated feature from the description into the granted claim. Therefore, the claims of this request must be examined for compliance with the requirements of Article 84 EPC (G 0003/14).

4.2 The incorporated feature defines the claimed composition for dyeing keratin fibers in such a way that the combination of oxidation dyes and direct dyes must be selected so that the resulting color results are characterized by a ""natural"" shine and a ""long-lasting"" even coloration. None of these newly introduced terms in the claim is suitable to define the subject matter of the claim in a way that allows for a clear distinction from the prior art. In particular, there is a lack of clear information on when the shine of dyed hair is considered ""natural"" and when an even coloration is considered ""long-lasting,"" or when this is not the case. Therefore, the claim is not clearly formulated.

5. Auxiliary request 1 thus does not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC.

Auxiliary Request 2 - Article 84 EPC

6. Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 is derived from claim 1 of auxiliary request 1. It includes the additional feature mentioned in point XII. of this decision, which defines that a color image obtained after dyeing lasts for a period of up to 20 washes of the dyed keratin fibers.

7. However, since claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 still contains the term ""natural shine,"" and at least this term has not been clarified by the additionally incorporated feature, the request also does not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC for the reasons stated above.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1.

Furthermore, they requested the non-admission of documents E17-E19.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Main Request - Article 123(2) EPC

1.1 Claim 1 of the main request has the following wording, with additions compared to the granted claim 1 underlined and deletions struck through:

""1. Metallic pearlescent pigments based on coated aluminum substrate flakes, wherein the aluminum substrate flakes have a thickness of 5 to 30 nm [deleted: 1-50, preferably from 1 to 30 nm], are monolithically constructed and optionally passivated, and are enveloped by at least one coating B made of at least one high-refractive metal oxide having a refractive index of at least 1.9, wherein coating B has a thickness of at least 50 nm and is essentially made of a high-refractive metal oxide selected from at least one of iron(III) oxide, chromium(III) oxide, vanadium(V) oxide, titanium(III) oxide, titanium dioxide, and/or zirconium oxide, and wherein between the surface of the aluminum substrate flakes and coating B there is at least one further coating A enveloping the substrate flakes made of at least one low-refractive metal oxide having a refractive index of at most 1.8, selected from the group consisting of SiO2, B2O3, MnO2, MgO, and GeO2 [deleted: and Al]2[deleted: O]3, wherein the substrate flakes have a further coating C, which is different from the underlying coating B, made of at least one metal oxide(hydrate), selected from silicon dioxide, silicon oxide hydrate, aluminum oxide, aluminum oxide hydrate, zinc oxide, tin oxide, titanium dioxide, zirconium oxide, iron(III) oxide, or chromium(III) oxide.""

1.2 The Board has concluded that the subject matter of claim 1 goes beyond the content of the original disclosure because a range of 5-30 nm for the thickness of the substrate flakes is not disclosed there. In particular, the passage on page 4, lines 5-7, of the originally filed description, which allegedly supports the amendment, must be read in conjunction with page 4, lines 30-32, and thus only discloses the claimed range for the average thickness.

1.3 The respondent argued that the claim and thus the feature ""thickness of 5-30 nm"" should be interpreted in accordance with the established case law of the Boards in light of the description, and thus also refers to the average thickness of the substrate flakes, so that the subject matter of the claim would not go beyond the original disclosure. As an example of this case law, the respondent cited the decision T 860/93.

1.4 However, the Board notes that it is also well-established case law that it is not permissible to ignore a clear and thus unambiguous feature in a claim or to assign a different meaning to such a feature that is only mentioned in the description (Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 9th edition, II.A.6.3.1, II.A.6.3.2, and II.A.6.3.4; see here, for example, T 197/10, headnote, and T 0177/08, reasons, points 3.1 - 3.3).

1.5 For the Board, in the present case, this second line of case law is decisive, as the feature ""wherein the aluminum substrate flakes have a thickness of 5 to 30 nm"" has a clear meaning, namely that the absolute thickness of the substrate flakes lies within the specified range or, in other words, that substrate flakes with a thickness of less than 5 nm or more than 30 nm are not present. Contrary to the respondent, the Board does not see this understanding of the feature as contradictory to the fact that claim 1 refers to the pearlescent pigments in the plural form, while the thickness is specified in the singular. The feature is thus not open to interpretation, and the skilled person would have had no reason to suspect that the specified range does not refer to the thickness of the substrates as stated in the claim but rather to their average thickness. The ""interpretation"" of the feature proposed by the respondent would amount to reading a limitation for the average thickness of the substrate flakes into the claim, which the claim does not provide, and ignoring the limitation of the absolute thickness of the substrate flakes provided in the claim.

For the Board, such an approach is also not supported by the decision T 860/93, to which the appellant referred, because in that case the interpretation of the term ""water-soluble cellulose ether derivative"" in light of the description corresponded to the general understanding of the term in the relevant technical field, see points 6, 4.1, and 4.2 of the reasons, whereas the interpretation of the claim proposed by the examining division contradicted this general understanding, see point 4.3 of the reasons, which is not the case here.

1.6 In the oral proceedings, the respondent referred to T 2278/18, but the Board also considers this decision to be irrelevant for the present case for the following reasons. In T 2278/18, the Board considered document D14 to be detrimental to the novelty of claim 1, although the term ""vapor barrier"" was used in D14, while the claim was directed to a ""vapor retarder."" However, the decisive factor was that the structure known from D14 was clearly described as having a vapor-retarding effect, see point 1.2.1 of the reasons, i.e., here the claimed feature ""vapor retarder"" was not interpreted differently in light of the description, but rather it was decided that the prior art actually disclosed a ""vapor retarder,"" even though the term was not used there. Thus, the case is not relevant to the question to be clarified here.

1.7 For these reasons, the Board sees no reason to interpret the feature ""thickness of 5 to 30 nm"" in claim 1 in light of the description as ""average thickness of 5 to 30 nm."" However, as already explained above, a thickness range of 5-30 nm is not originally disclosed, so the subject matter of claim 1 goes beyond the original disclosure. The main request is therefore not allowable (Article 123(2) EPC).

2. Zero Auxiliary Request

The Board does not admit this auxiliary request, which was submitted only after the summons to the oral proceedings, into the proceedings in accordance with Article 13(2) RPBA 2020, as the respondent has not presented any convincing reasons that would justify its admission. In particular, there are no exceptional circumstances, as the objection under Article 123(2) EPC, which the zero auxiliary request is intended to address, was already raised by Opponent II at first instance and then again with the statement of grounds of appeal dated February 11, 2020 (pages 3 et seq.).

The respondent sees exceptional circumstances in that the Board followed this objection in its preliminary opinion, whereas the objection could not convince at first instance. However, this argument is not convincing, as it is not unusual for a Board of Appeal to reach a different conclusion in the assessment of an objection than the opposition division. On the contrary, it is the purpose of the appeal procedure to review the first-instance decision.

Also, the fact that T 197/10 was discussed for the first time with the statement of grounds of appeal to further substantiate the objection does not justify the late submission of this auxiliary request. Rather, it would have been appropriate to submit a corresponding auxiliary request already with the response to the appeal to address the objection now further substantiated by T 197/10.

Since the Board does not consider the zero auxiliary request to be clearly allowable, it does not admit it into the proceedings.

3. Main Requests 1A-1D and Auxiliary Request 1

Claim 1 of main requests 1A-1D corresponds to claim 1 of the main request.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 corresponds to claim 1 of the main request with the additional feature ""and wherein aluminum substrate flakes are used as Al-VMPs.""

It has neither been argued nor is it apparent that the amendments to the description (main requests 1A-1D) or the inclusion of the new feature in claim 1 (auxiliary request 1) would overcome the objection under Article 123(2) EPC against the main request. These requests are therefore not allowable for the same reason as the main request (Article 123(2) EPC).

A decision on the admissibility of these requests is not necessary under these circumstances.

4. Auxiliary Request 2

4.1 Claim 1 of this request has the following wording, with additions compared to the granted claim 1 underlined and deletions struck through:

""1. Metallic pearlescent pigments based on coated aluminum substrate flakes, wherein the aluminum substrate flakes have a thickness of 5-30 nm, [deleted: preferably from 1-30 nm][deleted: ,] are monolithically constructed and optionally passivated, and are [deleted: at least] enveloped by a coating B [deleted: made of at least one high-refractive metal oxide having a refractive index of at least 1.9][deleted: ,] wherein coating B is made of Fe2O3 with a thickness of 50 to 300 nm [deleted: has a thickness of at least 50 nm and is essentially made of a high-refractive metal oxide selected from at least one of iron(III) oxide, chromium(III) oxide, vanadium(V) oxide, titanium(III) oxide, titanium dioxide, and/or zirconium oxide,] and wherein between the surface of the aluminum substrate flakes and coating B [deleted: at least] there is a further coating A enveloping the substrate flakes made of [deleted: at least one low-refractive metal oxide having a refractive index of at most 1.8, selected from the group consisting of] SiO2, B2O3, MnO2, MgO, GeO2, and Al2O3, with a thickness of 5 to 50 nm, wherein the substrate flakes have a further coating C, which is different from the underlying coating B, made of at least one metal oxide(hydrate), selected from silicon dioxide, silicon oxide hydrate, aluminum oxide, aluminum oxide hydrate, zinc oxide, tin oxide, titanium dioxide, zirconium oxide, [deleted: iron(III) oxide] or chromium(III) oxide, and wherein aluminum substrate flakes are used as Al-VMPs.""

4.2 Admittance of the Request

The objection raised regarding the lack of convergence of auxiliary request 2 with auxiliary request 1 is not convincing, as both the limitation of the thickness range to 5-30 nm and the limitation to the substrate material Al-VMP and the deletion of Al2O3 as a possible material for layer A are present in both auxiliary requests. Additionally, further restrictions have been included in claim 1 of the second auxiliary request. The auxiliary requests thus converge, so there is no reason not to admit the second auxiliary request, which was already submitted at first instance.

4.3 Admittance of Late Objections

For the first time during the oral proceedings, the appellant argued that the deletion of the specification of the refractive index for layers A and B in the current claim 1 leads to an extension of the scope of protection under Article 123(3) EPC, goes beyond the original content (Article 123(2) EPC), and is not prompted by a ground for opposition (Rule 80 EPC).

The Board does not admit this change of argumentation in accordance with Article 13(2) RPBA 2020, as the appellant has not presented any convincing reasons or cited exceptional circumstances that would justify raising this argument only during the oral proceedings. The second auxiliary request was already submitted at first instance and was extensively commented on by the appellant in the statement of grounds of appeal. At the latest after the respondent had resubmitted the request with the response to the appeal, the appellant should have raised all relevant objections under Articles 123(2) and (3) as well as under Rule 80 EPC.

4.4 Article 123(2) EPC

The objections raised with the statements of grounds of appeal, that claim 1 is based on a multiple selection and thus contains a combination of features not originally disclosed, are not convincing, as the claim is based on the originally filed claims 1, 5, and 6 and the feature ""wherein aluminum substrate flakes are used as Al-VMPs,"" which is disclosed as preferred on page 8, lines 15-16 of the originally filed description. Additionally, the option ""iron(III) oxide"" has been removed from the list of materials for coating C. Even if this deletion were to be considered a list selection, it would only constitute a selection, so the requirement of Article 123(2) EPC is fulfilled.

4.5 Article 84 EPC

The argument of the appellant that the term ""Al-VMP"" is not defined in the claim and its meaning is unclear is not convincing, as the abbreviation ""VMP"" for ""vacuum metallised pigments"" is familiar to the skilled person in the field of pearlescent pigments, so there is no need for a definition of the abbreviation in the claim.

Regarding the contradiction between the definition of thickness ranges in claim 1 on the one hand and paragraph 0017 of the description on the other hand, this contradiction already concerns granted claim 4. A clarity objection is therefore not possible in the opposition appeal proceedings (G 3/14).

4.6 Article 83 EPC

The Board has concluded that the invention according to claim 1 is executable.

4.6.1 The argument that the invention is not executable because claim 1 excludes the presence of an aluminum oxide layer on the surface of the Al substrates, although the formation of such a layer is inevitable due to the reactivity of aluminum demonstrated by E17, is not convincing, as the wording of the claim does not exclude the presence of such an oxide layer, but rather explicitly mentions the possibility of passivation in the claim.

Under these circumstances, a decision on the admissibility of document E17 is unnecessary.

4.6.2 The appellant further argued that example 1 is not reproducible, which was also acknowledged by the respondent.

However, for the Board, this does not automatically mean that the invention is not executable, as the question of executability under Article 83 EPC does not depend on whether the skilled person can reproduce the examples, which in this case are not inventive anyway, but whether the skilled person is able to carry out the invention defined in the claims, i.e., here to obtain a pigment with the features mentioned in claim 1, or to produce it by means of the wet chemical process mentioned in claim 2. In this regard, the Board notes that the wet chemical coating of substrates as such is known to the skilled person and is described in detail in paragraphs 0054-0066. However, no evidence has been provided that this general teaching, together with the skilled person's knowledge, is insufficient to produce a pigment according to claim 1.

4.6.3 The argument that the annex A already submitted by the patent proprietor at first instance cannot prove the executability of the invention for various reasons is also not convincing, as in an objection under Article 83 EPC, the burden of proof lies with the opponents, so that proof of executability by the patent proprietor is not required. The Board does not see that annex A in any way demonstrates the non-executability of the invention.

4.6.4 The same applies, regardless of the question of their admissibility, to annexes B2 and D2. Regarding annex B2, it should first be noted that the appellant derives different values for the thickness of the substrate from the figures than those indicated by the respondent, but even based on these values, the Board cannot see that annex B2 would support the objection of lack of executability. The document shows a substrate of (according to the appellant) 40 nm thickness with an Fe2O3 layer of 107-119 nm and thus a non-inventive pigment. However, the conclusion of the appellant that it would not be possible to apply a similar coating on thinner Al substrates is, for the Board, an unproven speculation.

4.6.5 The same applies to annex C2. This document also shows coated substrates. Regardless of whether these coated substrates represent pigments according to claim 1 or not, the Board does not see that C2 would prove that inventive pigments are not manufacturable.

4.6.6 In this context, the Board notes that the appellant has not conducted any experiments themselves, although the burden of proof lies with them. The appellant has argued that thin Al substrates are inadequately protected by a thin SiO2 layer of only 5 nm and thus cannot be stably coated in an acidic medium. However, corresponding evidence has not been provided.

Under these circumstances, the Board concludes that it has not been proven that the requirement of Article 83 EPC is not fulfilled.

4.7 Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

The invention relates to multilayer metallic pearlescent or effect pigments (paragraphs 0001, 0002, and 0012).

4.7.1 During the oral proceedings, the appellant presented an attack based on E10 and stated that they had no further objections. Opponent II, on the other hand, has raised objections based on E9 as the closest prior art in writing. For the Board, both documents are suitable starting points for assessing inventive step, as they relate to similar subjects as the contested patent, see below. However, the Board has concluded for the following reasons that the subject matter of claim 1 is not suggested by either document.

4.7.2 E10 discloses effect pigments, wherein an aluminum core is first oxidized by a wet chemical process, resulting in a reduction of the core's thickness through the formation of an aluminum oxide or aluminum hydroxide layer (paragraph 0064). A layer of a high-refractive metal oxide, in particular iron oxide (paragraph 0070), is then deposited wet-chemically onto this layer, enveloping the aluminum core. This layer corresponds to layer B in claim 1. Furthermore, according to paragraphs 0071 and 0077, an additional layer made of a low-refractive metal oxide, e.g., SiO2, may optionally be present between this iron oxide layer and the aluminum oxide layer. This layer corresponds to layer A of the current claim 1. According to paragraph 0077 of E10, the combination of a layer A made of SiO2 and a layer B made of Fe2O3 is particularly preferred. Additionally, a further low-refractive layer can be applied to the iron oxide layer (paragraphs 0075, 0076). Thus, the basic structure of the pigments according to E10 corresponds to that of the pigments according to claim 1.

It is undisputed that E10 does not disclose the thickness of layer A. Furthermore, the Board believes that E10 does not disclose the remaining features of the claim at least not in combination. For example, paragraph 0048 teaches a thickness range of 20-150 nm for layer B, preferably from 25-70 nm. Paragraph 0064 teaches a range of 10-250 nm for the average thickness of the aluminum substrate, preferably from 30-80 nm. Therefore, in both cases, a selection must be made to arrive at the claimed subject matter, noting that E10 discloses average thicknesses for the substrate. A further selection must be made regarding the materials of layer C (paragraph 0076), as boron oxide is not among the materials suitable for layer C.

The objective problem underlying the contested patent is to provide a cost-effective pigment that has high opacity and low application-related burning behavior (paragraph 0010). However, an increased opacity has not been demonstrated, as the contested patent does not contain an inventive example, and no cost advantage over the pigments known from E10 is either apparent or argued.

It follows that the problem must be reformulated as providing another effect pigment.

The appellant argued that the obviousness of the distinguishing features must be examined independently, as the features do not work synergistically together. Regarding the feature ""thickness of layer A in the range of 5-50 nm,"" the appellant states that this is a conventional measure.

However, the Board does not find this argument convincing, as paragraph 0072 of E10 teaches that the formation of a dense, homogeneous layer A is not desirable. Rather, E10 aims for the formation of a mixed layer that contains, for example, SiO2 and the underlying Al2O3 (paragraph 0072) and preferably additionally the overlying high-refractive metal oxide (paragraph 0073). E10 thus teaches away from the formation of a homogeneous layer ""made of SiO2"" in the claimed thickness range. In this context, the appellant also referred to E10, page 5, lines 30-32, but the Board cannot see the relevance of this passage. The reference by Opponent II to E16 (column 6, lines 28-32) is also not convincing, as mentioned above, E10 teaches away from a compact SiO2 layer. Thus, the skilled person would have had no reason to consult E16 for the thickness of such a layer not present in E10.

Moreover, the Board is not convinced by the appellant's approach to treat the distinguishing features separately, as they themselves stated regarding E5 that the thickness of the individual layers in an effect pigment must be carefully coordinated (page 40, third paragraph of the statement of grounds of appeal), so that the Board has doubts whether the distinguishing features can be treated completely independently. In any case, to arrive at the claimed subject matter, the skilled person would have to simultaneously:

- provide a layer A made of SiO2 with a thickness of 5-50 nm against the teaching of E10 (see above);

- select a low value for the thickness of the Al substrate from the range disclosed in E10 (paragraph 0064);

- select a high value for the thickness of layer B from the range disclosed in E10 (paragraph 0048);

- choose SiO2 or Al2O3 as the material for layer C (paragraph 0077); and further

- use Al-VMPs as substrate material, which are not disclosed in E10.

Such an approach to solve the problem is not obvious for the skilled person.

4.7.3 The same considerations apply to the substantially identical E3.

4.7.4 E9 also discloses effect pigments with a multilayer structure. A metallic substrate, which may consist of aluminum, is first coated with a layer A made of two materials of different refractive indices, with the materials arranged such that the refractive indices of the side facing the metal and the other side differ. A layer B is then applied on layer A, and optionally a further layer C, where layer B may consist of Fe2O3 and layer C may consist of SiO2, for example. The basic structure of the pigments according to E9 thus corresponds to that of the pigments according to claim 1.

Like E10, E9 also does not disclose the thickness of layer A. Furthermore, one arrives at the further features of the claim only through numerous targeted selection steps. For example, E9 discloses a general thickness range for the metal substrates of 20 to 3000 nm (paragraph 0022) and, in the case that aluminum flakes are used as substrates, a range of 50-1000 nm is disclosed (paragraph 0024). The opponents referred to paragraph 0025, but this paragraph discloses a thickness of 5 nm only in the case that the substrate is in the form of a film. Aluminum substrate flakes with the claimed thickness are thus not directly and unambiguously disclosed. Furthermore, to arrive at the claimed layer A ""made of SiO2,"" one must select both the material SiO2 (paragraphs 0041, 0042) and the embodiment in which a discrete SiO2 layer is present (paragraph 0032), and not just a gradient (paragraphs 0033, 0034). Further selection steps concern the material (paragraphs 0045, 0047) and the thickness of layer B (paragraph 0053) as well as the materials for layer C.

Also based on E9, effects or improvements are not demonstrated, so the problem must be formulated as providing another effect pigment.

For the reasons already stated regarding E10, the Board has doubts whether the distinguishing features can be treated separately.

Regarding the thickness of layer A, Opponent II referred to E16, which teaches a layer thickness of up to 40 nm. However, the Board believes that the skilled person would not have consulted E16, as according to E9, the SiO2 layer is part of a superstructure, namely the gradient layer (A) (claim 1), which thus differs from the conventional layer structure of E16. Even if the skilled person were to adopt the thickness of layer A from E16, they would, as stated above, only arrive at the subject matter of claim 1 through a targeted multiple selection.

The combination of E9 and E10 presented by Opponent II also does not lead to the subject matter of claim 1, as, as mentioned above, E10 does not disclose the features missing in E9 either.

Thus, the subject matter of claim 1 is also not suggested by E9.

5. Refund of the Appeal Fee

The Board has concluded that a refund of the appeal fee is not equitable.

The appellant has made such a request because the first-instance decision is not sufficiently reasoned in the sense of Rule 111(2) EPC, as the opposition division did not explain why the objection based on E9 as the closest prior art could not convince.

In fact, the minutes show that during the oral proceedings, objections based on E3/E10 and E9 were raised and discussed, but the decision does not address the objection based on E9. The opposition division merely states that it considers E3 to be the closest prior art, but fails to provide any reasoning as to why E9 was not considered the closest prior art. The decision is therefore not sufficiently reasoned (Rule 111(2) EPC).

However, the Board does not consider the error to be so serious that a refund of the appeal fee to the appellant would be justified, as the lack of reasoning regarding E9 was not relevant to the outcome of the proceedings. Furthermore, the objection based on E9 was not even raised by the appellant but by Opponent II. As stated above, the objection based on E9 was discussed during the oral proceedings but evidently did not convince the opposition division. While the division should have justified this, the lack of reasoning did not influence the outcome of the proceedings. Moreover, a refund to an appellant who did not even raise the objection themselves and thus evidently did not find it convincing at that time would not be equitable. For these reasons, the Board does not consider a refund of the appeal fee to be appropriate.

6. Admittance of E18 and E19

E18 was submitted by Opponent II in the context of the objection under Article 123(2) EPC against the main request. Since the document does not play a role in the Board's decision, a decision on the admissibility of this document is not necessary.

E19 was submitted by Opponent II in the context of an objection under Article 83 EPC in case the Board interprets the term ""thickness"" in claim 1 as an average thickness. Since the Board does not do this, a decision on the admissibility of E19 is also not necessary.

7. Orbiter Dictum - Adaptation of the Description

The following remarks are explicitly not part of the decision:

7.1 As stated above, the Board believes that claim 1 only makes statements about the thickness of the Al substrate and not about the average thickness. The same applies to the thickness specifications of layers A and B. Since according to paragraph 0017 of the patent specification all thickness specifications concern the average thickness, the Board does not consider the adjustments made at first instance to the description (paragraphs 0012, 0014) to be necessary.

7.2 Regarding the adaptation of paragraph 0079 of the patent specification, the Board considers version ""B"" to be suitable, as here, in contrast to the version maintained at first instance and in accordance with the originally filed passage (page 22, lines 31 - page 23, line 5), it is clarified that example 8 is not an inventive example.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2. The matter is referred back to the first instance with the obligation to maintain the patent in amended form based on claims 1-3 of the second auxiliary request submitted with the response to the appeal on June 9, 2020. 3.

I. The appeal of the opponent (appellant) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to reject the opposition against European Patent No. 1 501 775 under Article 101(2) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged under Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC) and lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC), as well as under Article 100(b) and (c) EPC for insufficient disclosure and inadmissible amendments. The admissibility of the amendments of the current main request (granted patent) was acknowledged in decision T 1521/14. The contested decision of the opposition division only addresses the grounds for opposition under Article 100(a) and (b) EPC.

III. The opposition division held in the contested decision that the subject matter claimed in the granted patent is disclosed in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art (Article 83 EPC) and is based on an inventive step starting from the technical teaching of document D1 (Article 56 EPC). The objection of lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC) was dismissed by the opposition division as inadmissible.

IV. An appeal was filed by the opponent (appellant) against this decision.

V. The following documents were referenced in the opposition proceedings, which are also relevant for the present decision:

D1:    US 3,983,078

D2:    US 2,508,036

D3:    US 4,426,542

VI. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the Board communicated its preliminary opinion to the parties regarding the arguments presented, namely that the appellant did not convincingly demonstrate that the method according to claim 3 is not sufficiently disclosed to a person skilled in the art, and that the contested patent appears to meet the requirements of Article 83 EPC. Regarding the question of the presence of an inventive step, the Board expressed a need for discussion, particularly concerning the question of how the skilled person would inevitably arrive at connections using the manufacturing processes disclosed in documents D2 and D3 as an alternative to the alkoxylates disclosed in D1.

VII. The appellant subsequently submitted another written statement with arguments regarding inventive step.

VIII. Throughout the appeal proceedings, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

Claim 3 of the granted patent does not meet the requirements of Article 83 EPC, as the skilled person is not enabled to carry out the claimed method by reading the patent application. Furthermore, the claimed subject matter does not involve an inventive step (Article 56 EPC). Based on the disclosure of document D1, the technical problem solved is merely to provide alternative alkoxylate mixtures suitable for use as detergents or cleaning agents. The solution according to the contested patent, namely the selection of alkoxylates of formula (I) having an alkyl chain with a specific isomer distribution, would arise in an obvious manner to the skilled person from the prior art, particularly considering documents D2 and D3.

IX. The respondent argued during the appeal proceedings essentially as follows:

The decision of the opposition division was correct, particularly as the skilled person is not led to the claimed solution of the technical problem of providing an alternative alkoxylate mixture from the technical teaching of document D3. Furthermore, the request meets the requirements of Article 83 EPC for the reasons stated in the decision of the opposition division.

X. An oral hearing took place on August 18, 2022.

XI. Claim 1 relevant to the present proceedings is identical in all pending requests and has the following wording:

""Alkoxylate mixture, comprising

XII. The appellant (opponent) requests the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the European patent.

The respondent (patent proprietor) requests the dismissal of the appeal or the maintenance of the European patent based on auxiliary requests 1 or 2.","Reasons for the Decision

Main Request

Inventive Step (Article 100(a) and 56 EPC)

1. The contested patent relates to alkoxylate mixtures and detergents containing them, particularly for washing or cleaning textiles (paragraph [0001]). The objective addressed in the contested patent is to provide alcohol alkoxylate surfactant systems that lead to improved soil removal in washing and cleaning agents and enhance the performance spectrum of these agents (paragraph [0008]). The patent claims, in addition to alkoxylate mixtures, a method for their production, detergents containing them, and their use for washing or cleaning textiles.

2. The Opposition Division recognized the presence of an inventive step based on the technical teaching of document D1 as the closest prior art. The Opposition Division identified the distinguishing feature between the composition claimed in the contested patent and the composition according to Example II of document D1 in the structure of the C10 alkyl moiety of the alkoxylate of general formula (I), as well as in the distribution of isomers A1/A2 in the alkoxylate mixture. It argued that in the absence of a specific technical effect attributable to the said distinguishing features, the technical problem solved should be seen as providing an alternative alkoxylate mixture that could be used as a detergent or cleaning agent. The proposed solution was considered to involve an inventive step, as the distinguishing features would not be suggested to the skilled person by any of documents D1 to D6.

3. The Appellant disagreed with this view. In their opinion, document D1 already discloses alkoxylate mixtures that contain both alkoxylates of general formula (I) according to claim 1 of the contested patent and those of general formula (II). They specifically referred to the mixtures listed in lines 3, 4, and 7 of Table I from column 10, as well as to Examples I and II. Some of these mixtures partially contained ""Dobanol 91-4"". This compound has branched alkyl chains with an average of 10 carbon atoms and thus corresponds to the claimed alkoxylates of formula (I) in the meanings of A1 and A2. Document D1 does not disclose only those compounds that exhibit the specific ratios of the isomeric compounds A1/A2 of formula (I).

However, according to the Appellant, this difference does not lead to a specific technical effect. Therefore, the solved technical problem is merely seen as providing alternative alkoxylate mixtures. The claimed solution to this problem would be suggested to the skilled person particularly by the technical teachings of documents D2 or D5/D6, each considering documents D3 or D4. This also applies to the remaining claims of the contested patent, thus the requirements of Article 56 EPC are not fulfilled.

4. The Respondent argued that only Example II of document D1 is suitable as a starting point for assessing inventive step, as the mixtures disclosed in Example I are related to the cleaning of oily metal surfaces and not as detergents for textiles. According to D1, linear alkoxylates are also preferred, and such linear alkoxylate-containing mixtures already yield detergents with excellent efficacy. Therefore, the skilled person would not derive any hints or motivation from D1 for the use of branched C10 alkoxylates as claimed. Furthermore, the skilled person would not receive any hints from D2, D5, or D6 regarding a claimed modification of the compositions known from D1. Thus, inventive step is present.

5. The Board follows the argumentation of the Appellant.

Closest Prior Art

5.1 Both the Opposition Division and the two parties argued inventive step starting from document D1 as the closest prior art. The Board agrees with this assessment. The document concerns, like the contested patent, cleaning compositions containing alkoxylate mixtures (column 3, lines 3 to 27). In particular, Examples I and II disclose alkoxylate mixtures suitable for use as detergents or cleaning agents. Contrary to the Appellant's assertion, the mixture disclosed in Example I is not exclusively suitable for cleaning oily metal surfaces. Rather, the cleaning of oil-stained rags is also described (""oil-stained rags"", column 13, line 50). Thus, Example I is equally suitable as a starting point for assessing inventive step as Example II. The mixture according to Example I contains 80 wt.% of the linear alkoxylate n-C10(EO)4 and 20 wt.% of Tergitol 15-S-9.

Distinguishing Feature

5.2 It was undisputed between the parties that the alkoxylate mixtures disclosed in document D1 contain alkoxylates of general formula (II) according to claim 1, namely alkoxylates with 12 to 24 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain and 3 to 15 ethylene oxide units (Tergitol 15-S-9 or Tergitol 15-S-7 in Examples I and II, as well as Tergitol 15-S-9 or Tergitol 13-S-9 in the entries of lines 3, 4, and 7 of the table in column 10; see the first note under Table I in column 9 of D1).

5.3 It was also undisputed that the alkoxylate mixtures according to claim 1 of the contested patent differ from those disclosed in document D1 in that the alkoxylate of general formula (I) contains alkoxylates A1 and A2, specifically in proportions of 85 to 96 wt.% and 4 to 15 wt.%, respectively.

5.4 In formula (I), the terminal group of the C10 alkoxylate is generically referred to as C5H11. In alkoxylate A1, the terminal group is specified as a linear residue n-C5H11-, while alkoxylate A2 has a branched residue at this position C2H5-CH(CH3)-CH2- and/or CH3-CH(CH3)-C2H4-. Therefore, alkoxylates A2 contain, in addition to the group C3H7-, an additional branching of the alkyl residue of the C10 alcoholates.

5.5 In contrast, the mixtures disclosed in document D1 contain alkoxylates that, like the compounds of formula (I) of the contested patent, have C10 alkyl groups. However, these compounds either have a linear alkyl chain (Examples I and II: n-C10(EO)4 and n-decanol(EO)4, as well as the entries of lines 3, 4, and 7 of the table in column 10: n-C10(EO)4), or they are branched, without the weight ratio of the isomers (A1/A2 in claim 1) being disclosed (entries of lines 4 and 7 of the table in column 10: Dobanol 91-4; see the second note under Table I in column 9 of D1). At least for Example I and the entries 3, 4, and 7 of the table in column 10, the proportion of components corresponding to formulas (I) and (II) falls within the scope of claim 1.

5.6 Thus, the difference between claim 1 of the contested patent and the disclosure of document D1 is that the mixture according to claim 1 of the contested patent contains alkoxylates of formula (I) which, although they have a C10 alkyl group like the aforementioned compositions from D1, are branched according to alkoxylates A1 and A2. They thus have alkyl groups corresponding to the formulas n-C5H11CH(C3H7)CH2- (A1), C2H5CH(CH3)CH2CH(C3H7)CH2- and/or CH3CH(CH3)C2H4CH(C3H7)CH2- (A2) (emphasis by the Board). Furthermore, the compounds containing these groups are claimed to be present in specific proportions in the mixture.

Technical Effect and Objective Technical Problem

5.7 There was also agreement between the parties that the mentioned distinguishing feature does not lead to unexpected technical effects, and that the solved objective technical problem can be seen as providing alternative alkoxylate mixtures to those in D1 that are suitable for use as detergents or cleaning agents. The Board agrees with the definition of the objective technical problem.

Solution to the Technical Problem

5.8 According to the claim, alkoxylate mixtures are proposed to solve this problem, wherein the alkoxylate of general formula (I) contains 85 to 96 wt.% of alkoxylates A1 and 4 to 15 wt.% of alkoxylates A2.

5.9 This problem is solved, as can be seen from the description of the contested patent. From the table on page 17 and from paragraph [0145], it can be inferred that the claimed alkoxylate mixtures are suitable for use as detergents.

Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

5.10 Disputed between the parties was to what extent the skilled person receives suggestions from the prior art to solve the technical problem posed - the provision of an alternative alkoxylate mixture to D1 - by replacing the alkoxylates (n-decanol(EO)4, n-C10(EO)4, and Dobanol 91-4) contained in the mixtures disclosed in document D1 with those that both correspond to the definition of alkoxylates A1 and A2 according to the present claim 1 and also exhibit their proportions in the mixture.

5.11 In the Board's opinion, this is the case for the following reasons:

5.11.1 Document D1 states that in the compositions disclosed therein, alkoxylates can be used that consist of a mixture of compounds of different chain lengths and degrees of alkoxylation (column 8, lines 29 to 39, as well as the notes to the table in column 9).

5.11.2 Document D1 already discloses alkoxylate mixtures that contain branched alkoxylates with C10 alkyl groups, particularly those that can be produced according to the OXO process (Dobanol 91 compounds, column 7, lines 6 to 19, as well as the second note to the table in column 9). Therefore, the skilled person, when searching for alternative mixtures, would use branched alkoxylates instead of the linear alkoxylate n-C10(EO)4, particularly those containing C10 alkyl groups that can be produced from alcohols made by the OXO process.

5.11.3 Document D2 discloses the use of alkoxylates for cleaning textile products (column 3, lines 6 to 8), as well as their production from 2-n-propyl-heptanol and 5 to 16 units of ethylene oxide (column 1, lines 17 to 41, as well as the last three entries of the table in column 1). The skilled person will recognize that these alkoxylates, which have a C10 alkyl residue, are fundamentally suitable as alternatives to those used in document D1 as components of the disclosed mixtures. From the table in column 1, they also learn that branched alkoxylates are advantageous compared to linear ones. Therefore, it can be assumed that the skilled person would consider using the alkoxylates disclosed in document D2 as possible components when searching for alternative alkoxylate mixtures.

5.11.4 Document D3 indicates that during the production of the 2-n-propyl-heptanol used in document D2 by ""oxo reaction"", alongside 80%-90% of this product, up to 20% of 2-propyl-4-methylhexanol is also produced (column 1, line 60 to column 2, line 16). According to claim 7 of document D3, no more than 15% of 2-propyl-4-methylhexanol (variant 1 of alkoxylate A2 according to claim 1 of the contested patent) is formed during an OXO reaction for the production of 2-propylheptanol (alkoxylate 1 according to claim 1 of the contested patent). The use of the alcohol produced according to document D3 in the synthesis of the alkoxylates according to document D2 thus directly leads to a distribution of isomers that corresponds to that of claim 1 (A1, A2) according to the contested patent.

5.11.5 Therefore, the skilled person, applying the production methods according to D3 and D2, will inevitably arrive at compounds that they would use as alternatives to the straight-chain (n-C10(EO)4) or branched (Dobanol 91-4) alkoxylates disclosed in D1, thereby obtaining alternative compositions for the specified purpose. Furthermore, the alkoxylates of the mixtures claimed in the contested patent are also produced from the corresponding alcohols (claim 3 and production examples).

5.12 The Appellant argued that according to column 6, lines 12 to 26 of document D1, linear, primary alkoxylates such as n-C10EO(6) are preferred. Therefore, the skilled person would not replace these with branched alkoxylates.

This argument is not convincing. The reference to the preferred use of n-C10EO(6) in the cited passage refers to the preferred use of these alcohol alkoxylates within the group of straight-chain, primary alcohols, but not to their general suitability or preference in the disclosed mixtures.

5.13 Thus, the skilled person is suggested the claimed alkoxylate mixture from the disclosure of document D1 to solve the posed problem. Therefore, the request does not meet the requirement of inventive step (Article 56 EPC) for this reason alone.

6. Since the present main request of the Respondent is not grantable for this reason, a discussion of the further grounds for opposition raised by the Appellant is unnecessary.

Auxiliary Requests

7. Claim 1 of the auxiliary requests 1 and 2 submitted by the Respondent is identical to claim 1 of the main request. The provision of the alkoxylate mixtures claimed therein is therefore also not based on an inventive step (Article 56 EPC). These requests are thus also not grantable.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The decision is annulled. 2.

I. The appeals of the patent holder and the opponent are directed against the decision of the opposition division to maintain the European patent

No. 2 912 149 in amended form based on the ninth auxiliary request.

II. With her statement of appeal, the patent holder submitted, among other things, the main request already presented in the first instance as well as auxiliary requests 1-11.

III. Claim 1 of the main request has the following wording:

""1. Use of a reaction product comprising a quaternized nitrogen compound, wherein the reaction product is obtainable by

reacting at least one hydrocarbon epoxide of the general formula I

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

wherein at least one of the residues R1 and R2 represents a straight-chain or branched, saturated or unsaturated long-chain hydrocarbon residue with 7 to 50 carbon atoms, and the other of the two residues may represent H or a short-chain hydrocarbon residue, selected from straight-chain or branched C1-C7 alkyl or C2-C7 alkenyl, optionally interrupted by one or more heteroatom groups, or optionally mono- or polysubstituted; and the residues R3 and R4 are the same or different and represent H or a short-chain hydrocarbon residue as defined above; with at least one tertiary amine of the general formula II

Claims 9 and 10 of the main request have the following wording:

""9. Use of a reaction product comprising a quaternized nitrogen compound or a part fraction thereof containing a quaternized nitrogen compound obtained from the reaction product by purification, as defined in one of claims 1 to 8 as a gasoline additive to reduce deposits in the intake system of a gasoline engine, such as in particular DISI and PFI (Port Fuel Injector) engines.""

""10. Use of a reaction product comprising a quaternized nitrogen compound or a part fraction thereof containing a quaternized nitrogen compound obtained from the reaction product by purification, as defined in one of claims 1 to 8 as a diesel fuel additive to reduce and/or prevent deposits in the injection systems, such as in particular the Internal Diesel Injector Deposits (IDID) and/or valve sticking in direct-injection diesel engines,

in particular in common rail injection systems.""

IV. In her statement of appeal, the opponent argued, among other things, that the invention was inadequately disclosed (Article 83 EPC). Furthermore, the main request submitted in the first instance exceeded the original disclosure content (Article 123(2) EPC), the subject matter of claim 1 was not novel under Article 54(3) EPC with respect to D5 (WO 2013/117616 A1) and not inventive under Article 56 EPC with respect to D3 (WO 2006/135881 A2) alone or in combination with D3 and D9 (WO 2010/101801 A1) or D1 (US 4 621 141), or with respect to D12 (US 2012/010112 A1) alone. Furthermore, claim 3 could not validly claim priority, so that its subject matter was not novel under Article 54(2) EPC with respect to D6 (US 2013/118062 A1). These objections also applied to the auxiliary requests.

V. After receiving the preliminary opinion of the board, the patent holder submitted a new main request on December 3, 2021, against which the opponent subsequently expressed objections regarding its admission and consideration.

VI. In a letter dated May 24, 2022, the opponent additionally argued that the subject matter of claim 3 of the first auxiliary request was not inventive starting from D6.

VII. An oral hearing took place before the board on July 6, 2022. During the hearing, the patent holder submitted auxiliary request 1C.

VIII. The final requests of the parties were as follows:

The patent holder requests the maintenance of the patent based on the main request or one of the auxiliary requests 1, 1C, or 2-11, thereby revoking and amending the contested decision.

The opponent requests the revocation of the patent with the revocation and amendment of the contested decision. Furthermore, she requests that the proceedings be suspended should the decision rely on the test reports D16 and D18 of the patent holder.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Admission and Consideration of the New Main Request

1.1 The new main request corresponds to the main request submitted with the statement of appeal, with ""alkyl"" and ""alkenyl groups"" removed from claim 1 in the list of optional substituents.

1.2 It was submitted on December 3, 2021, and thus after the notification of the summons to the oral proceedings. According to Article 13(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA) 2020, amendments to the appeal case submitted at this procedural stage are generally not taken into account unless the respective party demonstrates compelling reasons that exceptional circumstances justify the consideration of the amendment.

1.3 The new main request constitutes a change to the appeal case, as its subject matter has not been discussed in the previous proceedings. However, no exceptional circumstances justifying the admission of the request are apparent:

1.4 The patent proprietor argued that the request is a reaction to points 7.2-7.4 of the preliminary opinion, in which the Board stated that the explicit mention of alkyl and alkenyl groups in the list of optional substituents leads to claim 1 not fulfilling the requirements of Articles 84 and 123(3) EPC. In particular, given that the opposition division did not raise any objections in this regard or did not follow such objections, there was no need to submit the request before receiving the Board's preliminary opinion.

1.5 However, this argument is not convincing, as the aforementioned objections were raised by the opponent at least with the statement of appeal (point 3.1), so that the new main request could and should have been submitted with the response to the appeal. It is not in line with the new procedural rules for a patent proprietor to respond to objections only when these are raised by the Board. It cannot be considered surprising or even exceptional that a Board of Appeal deviates from the assessment of the opposition division in its preliminary opinion, as the purpose of the appeal procedure is precisely to review the contested decision. For these reasons alone, the request was not to be admitted into the proceedings.

1.6 It should be noted that the request prima facie would also not be patentable, as the subject matter of its claim 1 is broader than that of claim 1 of the first auxiliary request, which the Board had considered likely patentable in its preliminary opinion. The new main request includes optional keto groups as substituents of the amine (II), whereas the positive assessment of the first auxiliary request was at least partly based on the fact that such groups are not included there (see points 8.6.1 and 8.6.2 of the preliminary opinion). Thus, its positive assessment could not be directly transferred to the new main request, so that the request would also not be clearly patentable.

2. Auxiliary Request 1

2.1 Claim 1 corresponds to the main request submitted with the statement of appeal, with all but ""OH"" removed from the list of optional substituents in claim 1. The wording of dependent claims 3 and 5-7 remains unchanged compared to the wording of granted claims 3 and 5-7.

2.2 However, auxiliary request 1 is not patentable, as the subject matter of claim 3 does not involve an inventive step (Article 56 EPC). Furthermore, the subject matter of claims 5, 6, and 7 is not sufficiently disclosed (Article 83 EPC).

2.3 Priority

Claim 3 cannot claim priority, as the priority application EP12189538 does not disclose uses of compounds containing C1-C20 monocarboxylic acids, as claimed, but only the use of C1-C20 carboxylic acids, such as C1-C4 monocarboxylic acid (page 18, lines 8-10). The priority date of the claim is thus the filing date of October 23, 2013, which means that the document D6 published on May 16, 2013, constitutes prior art in the sense of Articles 54(2) and 56 EPC. This has not been contested by the patent proprietor in the appeal proceedings.

2.4 Consideration of the Attack under Article 56 EPC

The Board has concluded to consider the attack under Article 56 EPC against claim 3, as it was first raised in the submission of May 24, 2022, and a novelty objection based on D6 was raised both in the notice of opposition (point 8.2) and with the statement of appeal (point 3.4). The opponent is correct that under these circumstances, a specific objection under Article 56 EPC could not be formulated. While there are prior art documents relevant to the novelty of a claim, they do not at first glance qualify as the closest prior art, so that in such cases a late-raised attack under Article 56 EPC would unduly surprise the patent proprietor, but this is not the case with D6 due to its obvious technical proximity to the claimed subject matter. Furthermore, the patent proprietor was given the opportunity during the oral proceedings to respond to the attack and to address it by submitting auxiliary request 1c.

2.5 The invention relates to the use of quaternized ammonium salts of hydrocarbon epoxides as additives in direct-injection diesel engines.

2.5.1 D6 addresses at least a very similar task (title, summary, claims 1 and 3), so that D6 is suitable as a starting point for assessing inventive step.

2.5.2 D6 discloses the use of additives based on quaternized amines, which are produced by reacting tertiary amines (paragraph 0021) with a quaternizing agent, such as a hydrocarbyl-substituted epoxide in the presence of an acid (paragraphs 0023, 0027, 0028). These additives in D6 thus have the same basic structure as those according to claim 3, but D6 does not directly and unambiguously disclose the exact combination of the residues R1-R4 and Ra-Rc with the anion of a C1-C20 monocarboxylic acid.

In particular, the use according to example 3 (paragraph 0062) does not fall under the claim due to the length of the C18 substituent of the amine and the C4 substituent of the epoxide.

2.5.3 The contested patent aims to provide quaternized fuel additives that are easy to produce and have satisfactory additive properties (paragraph 0013). As stated above, the synthesis route according to the contested patent and D6 is similar, and improved additive properties of the additives according to the invention compared to D6 have not been presented or are otherwise apparent. Thus, the task can only be regarded as providing an alternative use.

2.5.4 As a solution to this task, claim 3 proposes to use a compound that has the residues R1-R4 and Ra-Rc defined in claim 1 as well as the acid anion defined in claim 3.

2.5.5 However, this solution is obvious, because starting from example 3 (see above) and tasked with providing an alternative use, it would be obvious for the skilled person to select from the alternatives disclosed in D6. For example, paragraph 0021 discloses numerous alternative amines, many of which have three C1-C7 substituents (for example, trimethylamine, triethylamine, tri-n-propylamine, dimethylethylamine, etc.), or which are cyclic amines according to claim 1 (for example, N-methylpiperidine). Furthermore, paragraph 0027 discloses that instead of the C4 residue (1,2-epoxyhexane) used in the example, a longer residue, such as a C48 residue, can also be used at the epoxide.

Thus, the skilled person would arrive at the subject matter of claim 1 by simple selection from alternatives already disclosed in D6. In this context, it should be emphasized again that the claimed combination of features does not produce a technical effect and is therefore arbitrary. The selection of such an arbitrary combination of features from the entire disclosure of D6, which does not exceed the effect disclosed for D6, is not based on an inventive step.

2.5.6 The patent proprietor argued that the teaching of D6 requires that the additives exhibit a thermogravimetric weight loss (TGA) of more than 50% (claim 1). However, since D6 does not contain a teaching on how this condition can be met, the skilled person would not have deviated from the teaching of the specific examples and thus would not have arrived at the claimed subject matter.

2.5.7 However, this argument does not convince the Board, as the skilled person would have no reason to assume that the use of materials mentioned in D6 in the context of the invention would lead to a TGA of more than 50% not being achievable. Rather, they would assume that the reactants mentioned in D6 in the context of the invention would also lead to the claimed products.

2.5.8 Thus, the first auxiliary request is not patentable (Article 56 EPC).

2.6 The first auxiliary request is also not patentable because at least parts of the subject matter of claims 5, 6, and 7 are not sufficiently disclosed:

2.6.1 According to claim 5, the amine of formula II may have three C24 residues, although according to claim 1, to which claim 5 refers back, the amine may have at most C7 residues. This deficiency initially presents a clarity issue, which cannot be objected to, as it already concerned the granted set of claims (G 03/14). A hydrocarbyl residue cannot simultaneously have up to 24 and at most 7 C-atoms, so this aspect of claim 5 cannot be disclosed.

2.6.2 A similar issue applies to the requirement of claims 6 and 7 that the epoxide of formula (I) may have a molecular weight of up to 20,000, as this is also incompatible with the C-atom upper limits defined in claim 1.

For these reasons as well, the first auxiliary request is not patentable (Article 83 EPC).

3. Auxiliary Request 1C

3.1 This request corresponds to auxiliary request 1, with claims 3 and 5-7 removed. Its non-admission was not requested. Furthermore, it constitutes a reaction to objections under Articles 56 and 83 EPC, which were raised for the first time during the oral proceedings. Since exceptional circumstances exist, the request was to be admitted and considered in the proceedings.

3.2 Article 123(2) EPC

Claim 1 meets the requirement of Article 123(2) EPC for the following reasons:

3.2.1 Claim 1 is based on originally filed claims 11 and 12. The explicitly mentioned use in claim 11 ""as a fuel or lubricant additive"" has been omitted. The claim is implicitly still limited to these uses, as it cannot be understood otherwise in a technically sensible manner.

3.2.2 Furthermore, the definitions of the terms ""long-chain"" and ""short-chain"" have been incorporated into the claim from the description (page 11, lines 20-21 and page 13, lines 1-5) to further define the epoxide (I).

The opponent has argued that the general definitions of the terms ""long-chain"" or ""short-chain hydrocarbyl"" on pages 11 and 13 cannot be read in conjunction with originally filed claim 11, as they would only apply if no contrary statements are made, which is the case for the terms ""long-"" and ""short-chain.""

However, this argument is not convincing, as the statement ""in particular C1-C4-alkyl"" on page 5, line 24 and page 8, line 22, to which the opponent referred, does not constitute a ""contrary"" statement to the definition on page 13, but merely defines a specific embodiment in this regard. The fact that the original application also discloses epoxides with such specific short-chain hydrocarbyls does not mean that the broader general definition of the term is no longer applicable to epoxides with short-chain hydrocarbyl residues.

The same applies to ""long-chain"" hydrocarbyls. The statement on page 7, embodiment 5 (also claim 6 as originally filed) does not constitute a ""contrary statement"" to the definition on page 11, lines 21-22, but rather defines a specific embodiment of long-chain hydrocarbyls in the sense of the definition on page 13.

3.2.3 The same applies to the restriction that the hydrocarbyl residues Ra-Rc of the amine (II) are also short-chain in the sense of the definition on page 13. This is disclosed on page 6, line 3 and page 9, line 1. These passages can also be read in conjunction with the definition on page 13, as no ""contrary statements"" are made that would exclude the applicability of the definition on page 13. Rather, the C1-C24 alkyl or C2-C24 alkenyl specifically disclosed on pages 6 and 8 are alternative specific embodiments of the alkyl or alkenyl residues disclosed as short-chain hydrocarbyl residues.

3.2.4 Finally, the optional OH substituents are disclosed on page 15, line 26.

3.2.5 The features incorporated into the claim are thus at least individually disclosed directly and unambiguously in the original documents.

3.2.6 The further objection of the opponent that the claimed subject matter is the result of a targeted multiple selection is also not convincing, as the relevant case law indicates that the result of such a selection from several lists only exceeds the original disclosure content if it involves lists of equivalent alternatives that also have a certain length.

Regarding the optional substituent ""-OH,"" there is no selection from a list of equivalent alternatives, as the compounds disclosed in the production examples either contain no substituents or OH groups, as in production examples 6 and 8.

Regarding the selection of short-chain substituents Ra-Rc on the amine (II), two equivalent alternatives to the ""short-chain hydrocarbyls"" are disclosed on page 6, lines 1-4 with C1-C24 alkyl or C2-C24 alkenyl, taking into account that their definition also includes C1-C7 alkyls and C2-C7 alkenyls, so that this is at least partly only a formal alternative that concerns the same matter. Furthermore, all residues Ra-Rc used in the production examples fall under the definition of short-chain hydrocarbyl residues according to page 13.

Finally, the opponent pointed out that the definition of the term ""long-chain"" on page 11, lines 29-31, provides further information on the molecular weight of the long-chain hydrocarbyl residues, which is not compatible with the aforementioned number of 7-50 C-atoms, so that a selection must be made between ""7-50 C-atoms"" and ""Mn of 85 - 20,000"" at the broadest definition level. However, this is also not a selection from a ""list"" of alternatives, as the two definitions overlap, with the definition aimed at molecular weight being broader than the definition aimed at the number of C-atoms, as the molecular weight of a saturated C7-C50 residue lies between 99 and 701. Thus, in principle, there was no selection between two alternative definitions, but rather the narrower definition was incorporated into the claim.

For these reasons, the subject matter of claim 1 does not exceed the original disclosure.

3.2.7 Regarding independent claims 5 and 6, the opponent pointed out that the references back to originally filed claims 13 and 14 were changed. However, from a technical perspective, it was obvious that these references back were incorrect and that in both cases a reference back to originally filed claim 11 was intended. Thus, these claims also do not exceed the original disclosure.

3.3 Article 83 EPC

It has not been shown that the invention is not executable across its entire breadth.

To execute the invention, a quaternized nitrogen compound according to claim 1 must be produced, and when used as an additive in direct-injection diesel (claims 1, 6) or gasoline engines (claim 5), fuel consumption and/or performance loss (claim 1) must be reduced or deposits must be reduced (claims 5 and 6).

In this context, it should be noted that not only claim 1 but also claim 6 is limited to uses in direct-injection diesel engines. This follows directly from the use of the definite article ""the"" (""in the injection systems (...) in direct-injection diesel engines""), making it clear that injection systems in general are not meant, as in that case the article would be absent.

The manufacturability of the compounds as such has not been questioned by the opponent. The objection of lack of sufficiency of disclosure is based solely on their assertion that it is not plausible that the effects claimed in the invention would be achieved for all claimed compounds.

However, this assertion is unproven, although according to case law, the burden of proof lies with the opponent. As the only piece of evidence, the opponent submitted experimental report D14, but D14 is fundamentally unsuitable to prove that the effects claimed in the invention and in the claims do not occur, as no experiments were conducted in direct-injection diesel or gasoline engines. In contrast, the contested patent shows at least one way in Table 2 of how the invention can be executed.

3.4 Novelty (Article 54(3) EPC)

3.4.1 The subject matter of claim 1 is novel over D5.

The compounds specifically listed on page 11, lines 4-19, such as 1-polyisobutyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, are not novelty-destroying, as they do not have OH groups. The opponent has also not contested that the inventive reaction products in the beta position to the quaternized nitrogen atom have an OH group formed by the reaction of the nitrogen with the epoxide, as shown in formula (IV) of the contested patent.

However, the opponent argued in this context that the OH group is simply not mentioned in the substance names, but it follows from the manufacturing method disclosed in lines 24-37 that it must be present.

This argument is not convincing, as this method is merely a ""typical"" synthesis route. Thus, it is not directly and unambiguously disclosed that the specifically mentioned compounds were obtained in this way and thus, contrary to the specifically disclosed names, would have additional OH groups. Furthermore, the aforementioned passage lacks information about the number of C-atoms of the polyisobutyl residue, i.e., the ""long-chain hydrocarbyl residue"" in the sense of the claim. While substituents falling under the claim are mentioned on page 7, lines 17-20, a selection must be made in this regard.

Regarding the manufacturing methods described on page 11, lines 24-37, several selection steps are necessary to arrive at an inventive compound: first, a C1-C7 alkylamine must be selected from the options C1-C13 alkylamine or polyisobutylamine, then polyisobutyl epoxide must be selected from the 5 disclosed epoxides, and finally, a polyisobutyl residue with 1-50 C-atoms must be selected from the preferred range of 30-250 C-atoms (page 7).

Thus, the subject matter of claim 1 is not clearly and unambiguously disclosed in D5 (Article 54(3) EPC).

3.4.2 The same applies to claims 5 and 6.

3.5 Inventive Step

The subject matter of claim 1 involves an inventive step.

3.5.1 The invention relates to the use of quaternized ammonium salts of hydrocarbon epoxides as additives in direct-injection diesel engines.

3.5.2 For both parties, D3 represents the closest prior art. This is agreed upon, as D3 addresses at least a very similar task (summary, page 1, lines 9-13 and page 5, lines 10-15), making D3 a suitable starting point for assessing inventive step.

3.5.3 Specifically, D3 discloses compounds of type (X), which are alkylated (quaternized) in a further reaction step at the amino group. As alkylation reagents, epoxides are disclosed, e.g., styrene oxide in example 1 (page 17).

The compound according to example 1 thus differs from the compounds mentioned in claim 1 by the length of the substituent R1 as well as by the length of the substituent Ra.

3.5.4 The contested patent aims to provide quaternized fuel additives that are easy to produce and have satisfactory additive properties (paragraph 0013). As stated above, the synthesis route according to the contested patent and D3 is very similar. Although the amine component (II) is produced in a multi-step synthesis according to D3, claim 1 is not limited to amines that are more readily accessible. Furthermore, improved additive properties of the additives according to the invention compared to D3 have neither been presented nor are they apparent, so that the task can only be regarded as providing an alternative use.

3.5.5 As a solution to this task, claim 3 proposes to use a compound that has the residues R1-R4 and Ra-Rc defined in claim 1.

3.5.6 However, this solution is not obvious, because while substituting styrene oxide with an epoxide with a chain length in the claimed range may be considered obvious, as D3 discloses corresponding epoxides as alternatives (page 12, line 14), it is not obvious to arrive at an amino substitution according to the claim, as the teaching of D3 is incompatible with the claimed residues Ra, as D3 teaches that the nitrogen substituent is formed using a long-chain substituted acylating agent (page 5, line 29), as used in example 1. The acylation also necessarily leads to the formation of oxo groups on the substituent, which claim 1 excludes. Furthermore, D3 does not disclose acylated and short-chain substituted alternative amines, and there is no reason apparent why the skilled person should deviate from this core teaching of D3.

Thus, starting from D3 alone, the subject matter of claim 1 is not obvious.

3.5.7 The opponent has combined the teaching of D3 with that of D9, but the skilled person would not have consulted this document to solve the task, as D9 is not directed to fuel additives like D3, but to lubricant additives. Given the task of finding alternative substances specifically for use as fuel additives in direct-injection diesel engines, it is not obvious to refer to a document dealing with lubricant additives.

The opponent's argument that the skilled person would have considered D9 because it cites D3 in paragraph 0008 is not convincing, as this paragraph merely describes that D3 discloses similar substances and how they are produced. It cannot be concluded that the reactants disclosed in D9 would also be suitable for producing fuel additives.

Even if the skilled person had consulted D9 in search of alternative amines for quaternization, they would have selected such amines as those disclosed in paragraph 0091, such as amines 14, 31-33, in light of the teaching of D3 to use long-chain amines, and thus would not have arrived at the claimed subject matter.

3.5.8 The skilled person would also not have referred to D1, as this document is directed to improvements in the filterability of diesel fuels, thus addressing a subject matter completely different from D3. Furthermore, D1 also discloses long-chain amines (claim 1), which are preferred according to the teaching of D3. Even considering the teaching of D1, the skilled person would not have arrived at the subject matter of claim 1.

3.5.9 In the written proceedings, the opponent also raised an attack based on D12. This is also not convincing, as the core of the invention of D12 is to carry out the quaternization reaction under acid-free conditions (title). It is not obvious to deviate from this core teaching. Furthermore, the manufacturing process according to D12 also leads to a substituent with oxo groups on the quaternized nitrogen, which claim 1 excludes. Thus, the skilled person would not have arrived at the subject matter of claim 1 in an obvious manner starting from D12.

3.5.10 Also in the written proceedings, it was argued that claim 1 is not inventive because there is no technical effect across the breadth of the claim. This attack is also not convincing, as the task is not based on a particular technical effect, see 3.5.4.

3.6 The same applies to claims 5 and 6.

4. Suspension of the Proceedings

The opponent requested to suspend the present proceedings in light of the pending case G 2/21, which they believe is prejudicial, should the decision rely on the experimental reports D16 and D18. Since this is not the case, there was no reason to suspend the proceedings.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2.

D7-D9:   |Tabulated compositions, tests for cleaning effect and skin compatibility, submitted on November 12, 2018, in the context of the opposition proceedings|

IV. In the contested decision, the opposition division concluded that the skin and hand cleaning agents defined in claim 1 of the patent in its granted form did not involve an inventive step, starting from D3 as the closest prior art. In particular, no improvements attributable to the distinguishing feature, the addition of the hydrophilic polyol ester as an emollient (feature a) of the claim), were demonstrated based on D3. The test results submitted in D7-D9 did not substantiate such an improvement. One of the polyol esters used in the patent was disclosed in D5 as a skin-friendly and skin-conditioning substance for use in skin cleaning agents. The claimed skin cleaning agents were therefore suggested to the skilled person from the prior art, Article 56 EPC. The same applies to the auxiliary requests.

V. In her statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the appellant contested this assessment and argued essentially as follows:

D7-D9 indeed demonstrated improved properties of the claimed compositions regarding cleaning effect and skin compatibility compared to those of D3. Although there was no direct comparison, it could be concluded from the results obtained in D7-D9 through extrapolation to such improvements.

According to D3, a high proportion of plant oils is used to ensure the skin compatibility of the cleaning agents. A skilled person would have had no reason to look for other emollients; the use of the products described in D5 was not suggested. Inventive step would therefore also be present even if an improvement over D3 could not be recognized in a direct comparison.

VI. In her response to the appeal and in the further proceedings, the respondent defended the decision of the opposition division. No improvements had been shown over D3 as the closest prior art. The technical problem to be solved was therefore merely to provide alternative coarse hand cleaning agents to D3. The addition of the polyol esters disclosed in D5 was not inventive, as they were described there precisely for the intended purpose, namely as skin-friendly emollients. It should also be noted that the claim of the contested patent does not exclude the presence of plant oils. Therefore, it is not about replacing these oils, but solely about the addition of the component described in D5. To further substantiate the objection, document D11 was submitted.

VII. On April 29, 2022, a summons to oral proceedings was issued for January 31, 2023. On September 23, 2022, the board issued a communication under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020. In this communication, it was stated that document D11 would likely not be admitted into the proceedings under Articles 12(2) and 12(6) RPBA 2020. Inventive step starting from D3 had to be discussed in the hearing.

VIII. The oral proceedings took place on January 31, 2023, during which all parties presented their final arguments on the question of inventive step.

IX. The requests of the parties were as follows:

The appellant (patent holder) requested that the decision of the opposition division be overturned and that the patent be maintained in the granted form, alternatively maintained in amended form according to auxiliary requests 1-3 submitted in the opposition proceedings, as well as the non-admission of document D11 into the proceedings.

The respondent (opponent) requested that the appeal be dismissed.

X. At the end of the oral proceedings, the decision was announced.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

2.1 The patent concerns skin and hand cleaning agents, particularly for coarse cleaning, which are used in industrial settings to remove stubborn dirt. The use of such coarse cleaning agents leads to defatting and drying of the skin due to the destruction of the skin's hydro-lipid mantle with frequent use. Therefore, the general aim in developing such cleaning agents is to minimize the aforementioned drying and defatting issues while maintaining cleaning efficacy. This is elaborated in paragraphs [0001] to [0004] of the patent.

2.2 Closest Prior Art

The closest prior art is undisputedly D3. D3 addresses the same problem as the contested patent, namely the drying and defatting issues associated with the frequent use of coarse hand cleaners, see page 1 lines 3-18 and 35-38.

D3 proposes to solve this problem by incorporating 10-30 wt.% of one or more plant oils into the cleaning agents, in excess of certain surfactants present in the composition, see page 1 lines 41-57 and page 1 line 67 to page 2 line 2. Data on skin compatibility testing of such compositions are listed in Table 1, indicating that these are more skin-compatible compared to conventional cleaning agents without the addition of plant oils.

2.3 Distinguishing Feature

The distinguishing feature of the claimed compositions compared to those of D3 is the presence of component (a), which is at least 0.1 wt.% of at least one polyol ester as a hydrophilic emollient with an HLB value of >=10.

This was undisputed between the parties. In particular, the parties also agreed that the plant oils used in D3 are not excluded from claim 1 of the patent, as they fall under the claimed component (h).

2.4 Technical Effect of the Distinguishing Feature

The parties disagreed on whether the addition of polyol esters achieves a technical effect. In the contested decision, this question was denied by the opposition division.

2.4.1 The appellant argues that the comparative data presented as documents D7-D9 show an improvement both in terms of cleaning efficacy and skin-friendliness of the claimed compositions compared to those from D3.

The chamber cannot agree with this. The compositions C1 and C5 tested in D8 do not contain any plant oil. The effect of a polyol ester on cleaning efficacy is examined there. However, the polyol ester is added to a composition that is neither disclosed in D3 nor falls under its teaching. With such an arrangement, no effect of the claimed compositions compared to those of D3 can be demonstrated. Although the appellant argued that the results of D8 could be extrapolated to oil-containing compositions, it has failed to provide any evidence for this.

The results of D9 also do not allow for demonstrating an improvement in skin-friendliness of the claimed compositions compared to those of D3. Although a reference composition T is used here that contains 20 wt.% rapeseed oil, the comparative inventive composition Tmod contains a polyol ester according to feature (a), but no rapeseed oil. Since, as stated above and undisputed, the distinguishing feature consists not in the replacement but in the addition of the polyol ester, such an experimental arrangement cannot demonstrate an improvement attributable to the distinguishing feature.

The opposition division is therefore to be supported in its conclusion that the claimed improved cleaning efficacy or the claimed improved skin-friendliness of the claimed compositions compared to those of D3 is not demonstrated.

2.4.2 However, this does not mean, as assumed by the opposition division and argued by the respondent, that the addition of the polyol ester, as defined in feature (a) of the claim, is entirely devoid of any technical effect.

Both from the data of the patent itself and from D8 and D9, it is evident that the claimed compositions containing a polyol ester but no plant oils show at least equivalent properties regarding skin compatibility. Such compositions include, for example, the composition C examined in the patent and the compositions C1 or Tmod examined in D7-D9.

The addition of the hydrophilic polyol esters according to feature (a) of claim 1 thus allows for the omission of the plant oils that D3 describes as essential.

This effect is already described in the patent both in the general part of the description in paragraph [0035] and with reference to the results achieved in paragraph [0060]. It is evident that the omission of larger amounts of hydrophobic plant oils is advantageous; after all, lipophilic oils compete in the surfactant-containing cleaning solution with the typically lipophilic dirt that is to be removed.

2.5 Problem and Solution

Therefore, starting from D3, the objective technical problem can be formulated as providing skin and hand cleaning agents that achieve comparable cleaning efficacy and skin-friendliness even without the presence of the plant oils required in D3.

This is achieved by the claimed skin and hand cleaning agents, which are distinguished from D3 by the presence of the polyol esters defined in feature (a).

2.6 Obviousness of the Solution

2.6.1 From the prior art, it was not suggested to the skilled person to use polyol esters as emollients starting from D3 in order to achieve satisfactory cleaning efficacy and skin-friendliness without the addition of 10-30 wt.% plant oils. The reasons for this are elaborated below.

2.6.2 According to D3, the presence of 10-30 wt.% plant oils in a specific ratio of surfactants is necessary to achieve satisfactory skin-friendliness, see page 1 lines 41-57 and page 1 line 67 to page 2 line 2. The presence of other hydrophilic emollients is neither explicitly mentioned nor suggested in D3.

2.6.3 The respondent referred to D5 here. D5 is a product brochure for TEGOSOFT® PC31, a hydrophilic emollient that falls under feature (a) of claim 1 and is also used in the example formulations of the patent. In particular, the respondent pointed out that this product is described as skin-conditioning and skin-friendly, thus possessing exactly the properties sought from D3. It is also described that it interacts synergistically with existing thickeners. Given the high proportion of thickeners in D3, which the skilled person would seek to reduce, this is another indication to use this product.

2.6.4 With regard to the technical problem to be solved, the reference to D5 is already irrelevant, as the skilled person cannot derive from D5 that the use of the polyol ester described there would render the presence of other emollients, such as the plant oils used in D3, unnecessary.

Furthermore, D5 does not mention coarse cleaners. Additionally, the application examples shown in D5 are a body wash or a watery facial cleansing foam. This does not correspond to the application described in D3. The example formulations are also aqueous or contain only small amounts of plant oils. A skilled person, having D3's cleaning agents in mind, would therefore have little reason to add the components described in D5 to the coarse cleaning agents described in D3.

The reference to the thickening properties of the product in D5 does not change this. D3 does not describe that the 5% proportion of thickeners used there is unusual or disadvantageous. A skilled person would not have attributed any particular significance to such properties based on D3.

2.6.5 The respondent has argued, citing the reasoning of the opposition division, that a skilled person would not have needed any particular motivation to add commercially available cosmetic additives, such as those from D5, to the compositions of D3.

However, it must be countered that this is not about adding any arbitrary components, such as emollients, to the compositions of D3 that do not alter the teaching of D3. The selection of the polyol esters described in D5, on the contrary, results in the possibility of omitting the plant oils described as essential in D3. In this respect, the selection of the polyols from D5 from the multitude of cosmetic additives available on the market leads to overcoming the limitations described in D3. There is no indication of this in either D3 or D5.

2.7 As a fundamental objection, the respondent has argued that the assessment of inventive step conducted in the manner described above is inadmissible. Claim 1 of the patent does not exclude the presence of the plant oils described in D3. The possibility of omitting the plant oils, considered to be an inventive contribution, therefore finds no correspondence in the technical features of the patent claim.

The chamber does not find this argument convincing.

The possibility of omitting the plant oils contrary to the teaching of D3 is a result of the presence of component (a). In the context of the problem-solution approach, the result to be achieved is part of the problem formulation and therefore does not need to be specified in the claim. Otherwise, the problem formulation would ultimately preempt elements of the claimed solution, see case law, 10th edition 2022, I.D.4.2.

The essential feature of the invention starting from D3 is the presence of the polyol esters (a). This feature surprisingly allows for overriding the teaching of D3, as described in paragraph [0035] of the patent. No further limitation of the claim is necessary.

2.8 D11

In her response to the appeal, the respondent submitted document D11 and referred to it in her arguments regarding inventive step. The chamber indicated in its preliminary opinion in its communication under Article 15(1) VOBK 2020 that the admission of this document into the appeal proceedings under Article 12(2) and 12(6) RPBA 2020 was unlikely. In the oral proceedings, the respondent did not refer to this document anymore. Therefore, a decision on its non-admission, as requested by the appellant, is unnecessary.

2.9 In summary, the chamber concludes that the composition defined in independent claim 1 of the granted patent is based on inventive step. The auxiliary requests of the appellant can be disregarded.

3. Since no ground for opposition presented stands against the maintenance of the patent, the opposition can be dismissed in accordance with Article 103(2) EPC. The patent remains in the granted form.

VIII. During the oral proceedings, the respondent withdrew the main request and made auxiliary request IB the new main request. The final requests of the parties were as follows:

The appellant requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the European patent.

The respondent requested the maintenance of the patent in amended form, based on auxiliary request 1B, submitted with the letter dated September 22, 2021.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Auxiliary Request IB (New Main Request)

1.1 Claim 1 of this request has the following wording:

""1. Pearlescent pigments comprising a largely transparent flake-shaped synthetic substrate with a density rhoS and at least one optically effective coating with a density rhoM,

characterized in that

the substrate has an average size d50 in a range of 2.0 mym to 8.0 mym, an average height hS in a range of 40 nm to 110 nm, and the total lead content of the pearlescent pigments is < 10 ppm,

an Fe2O3 content of 62.5-87.4 wt.% at an average Fe2O3 layer thickness of over 55 to 65 nm.""

1.2 Admission

1.2.1 The new main request was submitted as Auxiliary Request IB after the response to the appeal. Its admission is therefore governed by Article 13(1) RPBA 2020.

1.2.2 The Board has exercised its discretion to admit the request into the appeal proceedings.

Auxiliary Request IB is based on Auxiliary Request I already submitted in the opposition proceedings or on Auxiliary Request I submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal and includes additional amendments that address the objections raised by the appellant for the first time after the statement of grounds of appeal. The request also does not give rise to new objections.

1.2.3 In the opposition proceedings, the patent proprietor had submitted Auxiliary Request I, which, however, was not discussed on the merits due to the opposition division's decision to reject the opposition. With the response to the appeal, the respondent submitted, among other things, Auxiliary Request I, which corresponded to the first-instance Auxiliary Request I except for an insignificant editorial change in Claim 1. This auxiliary request was thus not late. The respondent then promptly submitted Auxiliary Request IB, which is based on Auxiliary Request I, to address the objections raised by the appellant against Auxiliary Request I under Articles 123(2) and 84 EPC. These objections were raised by the appellant for the first time after their statement of grounds of appeal, so the submission of the new auxiliary request at this stage of the appeal proceedings is not objectionable.

1.2.4 Furthermore, the request evidently addresses the objections under Articles 84 and 123(2) EPC. Accordingly, the appellant has not raised these or corresponding objections against the amended Auxiliary Request IB. It is therefore neither apparent nor argued that the amendments in Auxiliary Request IB would give rise to new objections.

1.3 Article 123(2) EPC

The subject matter claimed in the request finds a basis in the original application and therefore complies with Article 123(2) EPC. Claim 1 is based on originally filed Claims 1, 3, 4, and 6 as well as on the bridging passage over description pages 18 and 19. Claims 2-5 correspond to originally filed Claims 2, 5, and 8-10.

1.4 Article 83 EPC

The invention is executable. It is neither apparent nor argued, let alone proven, that pearlescent pigments according to Claim 1 cannot be produced.

It is correct that the contested patent does not teach any specific measures to be taken to obtain pigments with the claimed low lead content, but the appellant has not convincingly argued that, apart from the obvious step for the skilled person of selecting suitable lead-free or low-lead starting materials, further teaching would be required to produce the claimed pigments.

The objection of lack of enablement over the entire claimed range is closely intertwined with the novelty objection based on D5, as the appellant essentially argues that the pigments produced according to Example 3 of D5 would either have to have a lead content of less than 10 ppm (and thus be novelty-destroying) or that they would have a lead content of more than 10 ppm, which would then mean that the invention is not executable, as there is no explanation as to why Example 3 from D5 does not lead to a lead content of less than 10 ppm, unlike the inventive Example 1b of the contested patent.

However, this argument is not convincing, as D5 is not novelty-destroying because the document does not disclose the lead content of the pigments either implicitly or explicitly. This non-disclosure of a lead content of less than 10 ppm cannot be equated with the disclosure of a lead content of more than 10 ppm. Thus, there is also no contradiction between Example 3 of D5 and Example 1b of the contested patent.

This applies equally to the process, use, and coating agent according to Claims 4-6.

1.5 Novelty (Article 54(3) EPC)

The subject matter of Claim 1 is novel over D5, as this document does not disclose pigments with lead contents of less than 10 ppm. This applies equally to Claims 2-6.

1.5.1 It is undisputed that D5 does not contain an explicit disclosure of a lead content. An implicit disclosure also does not clearly and directly arise from D5.

1.5.2 The objection that D5 is novelty-destroying in light of the disclosure of D6 and D7 is not convincing, as even if the documents could be read together for the novelty assessment, D6 only discloses on page 406, first paragraph, a lead content of less than 20 ppm, but not the claimed range of less than 10 ppm. D7 also does not disclose the claimed range.

1.5.3 The appellant has raised another novelty objection based on D5 in conjunction with D11, D11a, D11b, D11c, D11b, D11a-1, D11d-1, and D16. However, the Board has exercised its discretion not to admit these documents into the appeal proceedings.

1.5.4 D11, D11a, D11b, D11c, and D11d were already submitted at first instance but were not admitted into the proceedings by the opposition division.

According to Article 12(6), first sentence, RPBA 2020, the Board generally only admits such documents if the non-admission decision was erroneous or the circumstances of the appeal case justify admission.

However, no such error of discretion is present, as the division applied the correct criterion in assessing the prima facie relevance of the documents and justified its conclusion in a comprehensible manner. The division pointed out that the documents are republished and further that only D11d provides a statement on lead content, which, however, relates to silver-coated glass pigments not used in D5. A consideration of the documents as a whole does not establish prima facie relevance. The discretionary decision of the opposition division not to admit the documents is therefore not to be criticized. Furthermore, it is also not apparent that special circumstances would justify the admission of the documents.

For these reasons, the Board did not admit these documents into the appeal proceedings according to Article 12(4), (6) RPBA 2020.

1.5.5 D11a-1 and D11d-1 were submitted for the first time with the statement of grounds of appeal, and D16 thereafter.

According to Article 12(6), second sentence, RPBA 2020, the Board generally does not admit new evidence if it could have been presented at first instance, unless the circumstances of the appeal case justify admission.

However, there is no apparent reason why the documents were not already submitted in the first-instance proceedings, and no special circumstances are either apparent or argued. Moreover, the documents are unsuitable for addressing the question to be clarified, namely the lead content of the pigments according to Example 3 from D5 (Article 12(4) RPBA 2020), as they disclose no lead contents except for D11d-1, and the republished data sheet D11d-1 relates to silver-coated glass substrates not used in D5.

For these reasons, the Board did not admit these documents into the appeal proceedings according to Article 12(4), (6) RPBA 2020.

1.6 Inventive Step

The subject matter of Claim 1 involves an inventive step. The invention relates to pearlescent pigments, among other uses in cosmetics.

1.6.1 D2 also discloses pearlescent pigments made from metal oxide-coated synthetic substrates for cosmetic applications (Claims 1 and 4) and thus represents a suitable starting point for assessing inventive step.

1.6.2 The respondent has requested that the attack based on D2 against Auxiliary Request IB not be admitted due to insufficient substantiation. However, since the attack is not convincing on the merits, see below, there is no need to decide on the admission of this request.

1.6.3 D2 discloses pigments based on substrates made of synthetic mica with an average particle diameter of 3-10 mym with a standard deviation of less than 1.7 mym and a thickness of less than 0.2 mym. It is undisputed that D2 does not disclose either the lead content of the pigments or their titanium dioxide content or the thickness of the titanium dioxide layer.

1.6.4 The appellant is correct that no evidence has been provided for a technical interaction of these two distinguishing features. In the absence of a synergistic effect, the distinguishing features can therefore be considered separately in the assessment of inventive step.

1.6.5 With regard to the differing lead content, a partial objective can be formulated as providing pigments with as low toxicity as possible.

1.6.6 To solve this objective, the contested patent proposes pigments with a lead content of less than 10 ppm. However, this solution is obvious, as it is part of the general technical knowledge, which is evidenced, for example, by D6, that lead is toxic and therefore a low lead content is particularly desirable in cosmetics. In this respect, it would be obvious for the skilled person to keep the lead content as low as possible in the pigments of D2, which are also intended for cosmetic applications, in order to achieve as low toxicity as possible. Such a further development of the pigments according to D2 is therefore not based on an inventive step.

1.6.7 D12, D12a, D12b, and D13 were submitted at first instance to demonstrate that a lead content in the claimed range is obvious, but were not admitted by the opposition division. Since the Board already reaches this conclusion without considering these documents, see above, there is no need to decide on their admission.

1.6.8 Regarding the TiO2 content or layer thickness, the appellant is correct that the partial objective is merely to provide further pearlescent pigments.

1.6.9 However, the solution proposed by Claim 1, namely pearlescent pigments with one of the specific combinations of titanium dioxide content and thickness, is not obvious, as the appellant has not been able to show that these features are known from the prior art. While they referred to page 4, lines 1-2 of D1 or paragraph 0013 of D4, these each disclose only a range for the layer thickness but no TiO2 content. The appellant has stated that the TiO2 layer thickness tends to correlate with the TiO2 content in the pigment, but the TiO2 content also depends on the substrate proportion and thus on the substrate thickness, as well as on the presence or absence of other layers, as disclosed, for example, in paragraph 0013 of D4. Thus, the presence of a layer thickness in the claimed range does not necessarily imply a titanium dioxide content in the claimed range. No other convincing reasons have been presented that would have led the skilled person to provide such contents. Therefore, the subject matter of Claim 1 is also not obvious when considering D1 or D4.

1.6.10 This applies equally to the subject matter of Claims 2-6.

1.6.11 D15 and D15a were submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal to demonstrate that no technical effect is shown in the contested patent because the pigment SunShine Super White, which is used as a comparative material in the contested patent, is not representative of D2. However, since the above argument does not rely on a technical effect, there is no need to decide on the admission of these documents.

1.6.12 Essentially the same arguments apply if D3 or D1 is taken as the closest prior art, as the distinguishing features are the same in both cases as with D2. Here too, it has not been shown that it is obvious to arrive at a pearlescent pigment that has a layer thickness and a titanium dioxide content in one of the claimed ranges. D1 also only discloses glass substrates (Claim 1), and it has not been convincingly argued why the skilled person would deviate from this and use synthetic mica.

1.7 Admission of the Attack of Lack of Inventive Step Based on D5

For the first time with the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant argued that the subject matter of granted Claim 6 and thus of Claim 1 of the main request could not claim the priority of document D14, so that for this subject matter D5 represents the full prior art in the sense of Article 54(2) EPC and could therefore also be invoked under Article 56 EPC. The priority-establishing application D14 was submitted to demonstrate the invalidity of the priority.

The Board did not admit this new argument into the appeal proceedings because it should have been made at first instance (Article 12(6) RPBA 2020). The objection relates to the subject matter of a granted claim, and D5 has also been in the proceedings from the beginning.

The appellant has argued that at least the novelty of granted Claim 6 has already been attacked based on D5 with the notice of opposition. Aside from the fact that the notice of opposition is contradictory in this respect, see paragraphs 15 and 22, this does not change the fact that the attack under Article 56 EPC is a new argument that has been made for the first time in the appeal proceedings.

The appellant further argued that D5 and D14 are applications of the patent proprietor, so that they could not be surprised by the objection, but the crucial point is less that the objection may surprise the patent proprietor, but rather that the opposition division could not decide on the objection due to the late submission. Admission would therefore contradict the primary aim of the appeal proceedings, which is to judicially review the contested decision (Article 12(2) RPBA 2020).","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2.

IV. The appeal of the opponent (hereinafter ""Appellant"") is directed against the decision of the opposition division to reject the opposition.

V. In the contested decision, the opposition division stated that the composition according to claim 1 should be interpreted as any composition containing EPA and DHA in any form. Furthermore, the claimed administration period should be understood as meaning that the patients should not receive the composition earlier than 48 to 24 hours before the cancer treatment. Moreover, the claimed subject matter is executable and involves an inventive step starting from document D8 as the closest prior art.

VI. In a communication pursuant to Article 15 (1) RPBA, the Board communicated its preliminary assessment regarding the interpretation of claim 1 to the parties.

VII. The oral proceedings took place on May 5, 2023, in the presence of all parties and were held as a video conference. At the end of the proceedings, the decision was announced.

VIII. The relevant arguments of the Appellant for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) Admission of the Appellant's objection under Article 100 (b) EPC regarding the plausibility of the claimed prevention of side effects caused by chemotherapy or radiotherapy (see page 17, paragraph 1 of the appeal brief)

This objection was already part of the opposition proceedings, albeit in a different presentation. For instance, page 11, paragraph 2 of the notice of opposition addresses the lack of executability of all claimed medical indications. Furthermore, this paragraph specifically discusses the lack of executability of the claimed prevention of side effects caused by chemotherapy or radiotherapy in connection with claim 2 of the patent as granted.

Moreover, this objection represents a direct response to the contested decision. In point 11.6.4 of this decision, the opposition division failed to consider the prevention of side effects caused by chemotherapy or radiotherapy when formulating the objective technical problem. This shows that the opposition division regarded the prevention of these side effects (hereinafter ""claimed prevention"") as a task separate from the reduction of these side effects. For this reason, it was necessary to present the objection under Article 100 (b) EPC regarding the plausibility of the claimed prevention separately in the appeal proceedings.

b) Admission of the Appellant's argument based on document D14 in the discussion of the inventive step of claim 1 of the main request

This presentation is not late. Page 23, paragraph 2 of the appeal brief already stated that the claimed administration period is a purely arbitrary selection from a multitude of possible solutions and therefore cannot be inventive. Due to this overarching reason, it was not necessary to explicitly refer to document D14 in the appeal brief.

c) Interpretation of claim 1 - technical significance of the feature ""combination of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)""

The opposition division wrongly interpreted this feature in light of the description of the patent. According to the principle developed by the Boards of Appeal, such an interpretation is only justified in the case of unclear or ambiguous terms. However, in the present case, it is sufficiently known to a person skilled in the technical field of the patent, a pharmacological chemist or pharmacologist, that the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid mentioned in claim 1 are polyunsaturated fatty acids, i.e., organic substances with the functional group COOH. In contrast, the salts and esters of these acids are referred to as eicosapentaenoates and docosahexaenoates. Consequently, it is unequivocally clear to the skilled person that the terms ""eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)"" and ""docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)"" in the claims refer exclusively to the free acids.

d) Interpretation of claim 1 - technical significance of the feature ""wherein the composition is to be administered parenterally to the patient only 48 to 24 hours before the start of a cycle of chemotherapy or radiotherapy""

For the informed skilled person, the wording ""wherein the composition is to be administered parenterally to the patient only 48 to 24 hours before the start of a cycle of chemotherapy or radiotherapy"" in this grammatical construction is not unambiguous. On the one hand, this wording could mean that the administration of the claimed composition must only occur within the stated time frame, i.e., not earlier than 48 to 24 hours before the start of a cycle of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. On the other hand, the chosen wording could also be interpreted to mean that claim 1 does not prohibit an additional administration of this composition earlier than 48 to 24 hours before the start of a cycle of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Given this ambiguity, an interpretation of claim 1 in light of the description and drawings of the patent is necessary. From paragraph [0083] and figure 3 of the patent, it is evident that a parenteral administration of EPA and DHA must occur 48 to 24 hours before the start of a cycle of chemotherapy or radiotherapy but can also occur additionally beforehand. Accordingly, claim 1 should be interpreted to allow for further parenteral administration of the claimed composition before the start of the claimed administration period.

e) Executability of the claimed invention

Contrary to the assessment of the opposition division, the patent does not meet the requirement of executability for two reasons.

Firstly, the patent does not plausibly demonstrate the claimed therapeutic effects. In vivo examples 5 and 8 of the patent contain only general statements that the alleged indications are achieved by a composition called Omegaven®. In contrast, examples 6 and 7 of the patent did not test combinations of EPA and DHA. Furthermore, the experiments described in all these examples are insufficiently specified. Finally, the results presented in figures 4A and 4B of the patent are overall very questionable considering the fact that

i) the error bars shown in these figures indicate a strong dispersion of the measured data;

ii) the survival rates of untreated cancer cells in figures 4A and 4B of the patent and in figure 1 of document D12 are fundamentally different, although they should be identical,

iii) the experimental results of figure 4A show that the survival rate of untreated cancer cells irradiated with 2 Gy is lower than the survival rate of cancer cells pre-treated with 20 µM DHA and also irradiated with 2 Gy.

Secondly, a lack of executability of the claimed invention arises from the fact that EPA and DHA in the form of their free acids are toxic to healthy body cells after parenteral administration, as evidenced by documents D1 and D3 to D7. Consequently, a parenteral administration of these acids would not reduce or prevent the side effects caused by chemotherapy or radiotherapy but rather exacerbate them. In this context, the skilled person would need guidance that allows them to identify a claimed composition containing EPA and DHA in the form of their free acids that improves the efficacy of chemotherapy or radiotherapy after parenteral administration and furthermore reduces or prevents the side effects caused by this therapy. Nevertheless, neither the patent nor the prior art provides such guidance, so that the skilled person would have to undertake an extensive research program to execute the claimed subject matter across the entire scope. This constitutes an unreasonable burden.

f) Inventive step

The claimed administration period constitutes the only difference from the closest prior art, document D8. This distinguishing feature cannot be assigned a technical effect. Accordingly, the objective technical problem should be seen as providing an alternative therapy to improve the effect of radiation and chemotherapy while simultaneously reducing side effects. The solution proposed in claim 1 to this problem is suggested by document D8 itself.

In particular, this document already discloses the concept of pre-treatment to reduce the side effects caused by chemotherapy or radiotherapy (see summary, paragraphs [0052] to [0054] and claims 5 and 8). Furthermore, the pre-treatment period disclosed in this document already includes the claimed administration period. Consequently, the latter is an arbitrary selection, as confirmed by the patent itself in paragraph [0083] and the originally filed application documents on page 16, paragraph 2.

Moreover, the opposition division wrongly affirmed the plausibility of the effect allegedly shown for Omegaven® in the patent across the entire breadth of claim 1 in its decision. On the one hand, table I on page 12 of document D8 states that the proportion of EPA in the composition must be at least 5.7 g per 100 ml, raising serious doubts that the claimed technical effects could be achieved with the claimed amount of 1 g EPA per 100 ml composition. On the other hand, it is known that the amount of EPA and DHA encompassed by claim 1 of a total of 14 g per 100 ml composition is toxic, and administering too large an amount of EPA and DHA leads to harmful oversaturation.

V. The relevant arguments of the Respondent for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) Admission of the Appellant's objection under Article 100 (b) EPC regarding the plausibility of the claimed prevention of side effects caused by chemotherapy or radiotherapy

Contrary to the Appellant's view, this objection was not part of the opposition proceedings but was raised for the first time in the appeal brief. Accordingly, this objection should not be admitted into the proceedings as a late submission.

b) Admission of the argumentation based on document D14 in the discussion of the inventive step of claim 1 of the main request

This factual presentation should not be admitted into the proceedings as late. It was first presented during the oral proceedings before the Board. Nevertheless, document D14 was already mentioned in the contested decision, so the Appellant could and should have addressed this point in the appeal brief.

c) Interpretation of claim 1 - technical significance of the feature ""combination of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)""

The term ""omega-3 fatty acids"" does not have a clearly defined technical meaning in the technical field of the present invention. This arises from both the description of the patent itself and the prior art, for example, documents D8 and D9. Consequently, the interpretation of the feature ""combination of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)"" as held by the opposition division is not to be criticized.

d) Interpretation of claim 1 - technical significance of the feature ""wherein the composition is to be administered parenterally to the patient only 48 to 24 hours before the start of a cycle of chemotherapy or radiotherapy""

The opposition division's assessment that this feature should be understood as meaning that patients should not receive a composition according to claim 1 earlier than 48 to 24 hours before the start of a cycle of chemotherapy or radiotherapy is correct.

e) Executability of the claimed invention

According to examples 5 to 8 of the patent, the claimed technical effects are sufficiently substantiated and are also confirmed by the experimental data of documents D10 and D12. In contrast, the burden of proof lies with the Appellant, who has not provided facts or data that seriously call into question the suitability of the claimed compositions for the claimed medical uses. The objection of the Appellant based on documents D1 and D3 to D7 is also unfounded, as none of these documents provide evidence of the alleged toxicity of EPA and DHA in the form of their free acids to healthy body cells.

f) Inventive step

The claimed subject matter differs from document D8 inter alia in that the claimed composition is to be administered only 48 to 24 hours before the start of a cycle of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. This difference entails significantly greater flexibility of the claimed therapy. Accordingly, the objective technical problem should be formulated as providing an improved therapy for the claimed use.

Even if the objective technical problem consisted merely in providing an alternative therapy for the claimed use, the proposed solution to this problem according to claim 1 is nevertheless not suggested by document D8. Document D8 instructs to start administering the fish oil-containing compositions at least one week, preferably 2 weeks, before the actual treatment (see paragraph [0099]). There is no indication that a lead time of 48 to 24 hours could also be considered sufficient.

Moreover, paragraph [0083] of the patent discloses the claimed administration period as particularly preferred, so that the arbitrary selection claimed by the Appellant would not apply.

VI. The relevant requests of the Appellant and the Respondent for the present decision are as follows.

The Appellant requested that the contested decision be overturned and the patent be revoked in its entirety.

The Respondent requested as the main request that the appeal be dismissed and the patent be maintained as granted.

Additionally, it requested that the Appellant's objection under Article 100 (b) EPC regarding the plausibility of the claimed prevention of side effects caused by chemotherapy or radiotherapy not be admitted into the appeal proceedings due to late submission.

Furthermore, it requested that the Appellant's argumentation based on document D14 in the discussion of the inventive step of claim 1 of the main request not be admitted into the appeal proceedings.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

Procedural Questions

2. Admission of the appellant's objection under Article 100 b) EPC regarding the plausibility of the claimed prevention of side effects caused by chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

2.1 The Board agrees with the respondent that this objection was raised for the first time in the statement of grounds of appeal. The reasons are as follows.

2.1.1 The passage cited by the appellant in this context on page 11, paragraph 2 of the notice of opposition states:

""This lack of plausibility is by no means overcome with any of the dependent claims 2 - 6. These are merely concerned with an enumeration of specific side effects to be prevented/reduced (claim 2), cancers to be treated (claim 3) and chemotherapies (claims 4 and 5) or radiotherapies (claim 6) the efficacy of which is to be improved. In the absence of any solid experimental data, as detailed above, these proliferations amount to nothing more than desiderata.""

2.1.2 It is undisputed that this paragraph mentions the prevention and reduction of side effects according to claim 2 as separate medical indications.

2.1.3 However, argumentatively, this paragraph does not distinguish between these two indications but merely refers to a previously raised objection in the notice of opposition regarding lack of plausibility (""This lack of plausibility [..]""). As stated by the appellant, the latter concerns all medical indications encompassed by claim 1 (see notice of opposition, page 9, second paragraph to page 11, first paragraph).

2.1.4 Thus, the argumentation presented on page 11, paragraph 2 of the notice of opposition constitutes a blanket attack under Article 100 b) EPC regarding the plausibility of all medical indications of claim 1 of the patent in the granted version.

2.1.5 In contrast, the arguments presented in the statement of grounds of appeal are substantively tailored to the medical indication of preventing side effects caused by chemotherapy or radiotherapy encompassed by claim 1. The appellant refers on page 17, paragraph 1 of their statement of grounds of appeal to the definitions of the term ""prevention"" listed in the Duden and in the patent and argues on this basis that the patent does not make the claimed prevention of side effects caused by chemotherapy or radiotherapy plausible.

2.1.6 Such an argumentation line is not found on page 11, paragraph 2 of the notice of opposition.

2.1.7 It follows that the objection raised by the appellant under Article 100 b) EPC is not merely a different representation or further development of the previous attack raised in the opposition proceedings under Article 100 b) EPC, but an additional and thus modified submission in the sense of Article 12 (4), first sentence, RPBA 2020.

2.2 The admission of such a submission is at the discretion of the Board (Article 12 (4), second sentence, RPBA 2020). According to Article 12 (6), second sentence, RPBA 2020, the Board does not admit objections that could have been raised in the proceedings leading to the contested decision unless the circumstances of the appeal case justify their admission.

2.3 In the present case, such circumstances are not apparent. The objection raised in the statement of grounds of appeal under Article 100 (b) EPC regarding the plausibility of the claimed prevention is directed against claim 1 of the patent in the granted version and could therefore have and must have been raised in the opposition proceedings. Accordingly, this objection does not constitute a direct response to point 11.6.4 of the contested decision, contrary to the appellant's assertion. The Board has therefore decided, in exercising its discretion under Article 12 (4), second sentence, RPBA 2020, not to admit this objection into the appeal proceedings (Article 12 (6), second sentence, RPBA 2020).

3. Admission of the appellant's argumentation based on document D14 in the discussion of the inventive step of claim 1 of the main request.

3.1 In the oral proceedings, the appellant argued, referring to specific passages of document D14, that the selection of the claimed administration period is based on general technical knowledge in the field of pharmacokinetics of parenterally administered fatty acids.

3.2 Such a presentation is not found in the passage cited by the appellant in this context on page 23, paragraph 2 of the statement of grounds of appeal. As the respondent correctly pointed out, this passage merely contains the blanket statement that the claimed administration period is a purely arbitrary selection from a multitude of possible solutions.

3.3 Consequently, the argumentation line based on document D14 presented by the appellant constitutes a new line of attack presented for the first time in the oral proceedings and thus a change in their appeal submissions in the sense of Article 13 (2) RPBA 2020.

3.4 However, the appellant has not asserted any exceptional circumstances in the sense of Article 13 (2) RPBA 2020 to justify the admission of this change.

3.5 The Board has therefore decided, in exercising its discretion under Article 13 (2) RPBA 2020, not to admit the argumentation line based on document D14 into the appeal proceedings.

Main Request (Patent in the Granted Version)

4. Interpretation of Claim 1

4.1 According to established case law, a person skilled in the art reads a patent claim with the willingness to understand it in a technically sensible manner. It is equally undisputed in case law that the terms used in a patent claim are to be given their normal meaning in the relevant technical field. However, it is disputed in case law whether and to what extent the description may be referred to when interpreting a patent claim. According to one opinion in case law, this is only considered when the wording of the relevant patent claim is ambiguous. According to a second opinion in case law, Article 69 EPC is applicable to the interpretation of claims, so that the interpretation must always be made in light of the description (see e.g. T 367/20, points 1.3.3 to 1.3.6 of the reasons; T 1473/19, points 3.1 to 3.15 of the reasons).

4.2 In the present case, the Board does not need to take a position on this question. The Board has concluded that some features of claim 1 of the main request are ambiguous for the skilled person and for this reason, referring to the description is permissible and necessary in any case. Other features of claim 1, regarding which the question of the correct interpretation has also been raised, are amenable to a clear interpretation, which is in turn confirmed by the description, so that the question of whether the description should be consulted can remain unanswered.

The former applies to the following features of claim 1:

a) ""Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)""

The latter applies to the following feature of claim 1:

b) ""wherein the composition is to be administered to the patient only 48 to 24 hours before the start of a cycle of chemotherapy or radiotherapy""

Regarding a) - Technical Meaning of the Feature ""Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)""

4.3 The respondent has argued that the terms ""eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)"" and ""docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)"" do not have a clearly defined technical meaning in the technical field of the present invention.

4.4 To support their statement, the respondent referred to the prior published patent documents D8 and D9. These documents are undisputedly in the same technical field as the patent.

4.4.1 Document D8 describes the use of fatty acids to minimize side effects of chemotherapies and radiotherapies and to improve the efficacy of these therapies (see paragraphs [0004], [0010]). According to claim 1 of this document, the fatty acids are derived from concentrated fish oil and contain omega-3 fatty acids in an amount of at least 50% based on the total volume, with EPA making up at least 30% of these omega-3 fatty acids and DHA making up at least 10% of these omega-3 fatty acids.

4.4.2 Document D9 is also directed to the use of fatty acids for the treatment and prevention of side effects caused by chemotherapy (see claim 1). According to claim 2, these fatty acids include EPA and DHA.

4.5 Thus, in claim 1 of document D8, in claim 2 of document D9, and in claim 1 of the patent, the terms ""EPA"" and ""DHA"" are used equally.

4.6 However, the descriptions of documents D8 and D9 indicate that the terms EPA and DHA used in claim 1 or claim 2 are not necessarily to be understood as EPA and DHA in the form of their free acids.

4.6.1 For instance, document D8 mentions in paragraph [0049] that the invention may be a physical mixture of a concentrated fish oil rich in omega-3 fatty acids. It is well known and not disputed by any of the parties that omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil are not present as acids but as triglycerides (see point 11.4.2 of the contested decision).

4.6.2 Document D9 discloses in the paragraph spanning pages 5 and 6 that the fatty acids according to the invention can be administered, among other forms, as free fatty acids, esters (e.g., triglycerides), and salts. This statement is consistent with the examples C and D of the invention. For example, example 8 teaches that the fatty acids according to the invention can be not only the free acids themselves but also triglycerides or other esters. Examples C and D describe the medical treatment of cancer patients with a lithium salt of gamma-linolenic acid or with a triglyceride of eicosapentaenoic acid.

4.7 The appellant argued that documents D8 and D9 reveal the terms ""EPA"" and ""DHA"" in a specific context. Document D8 uses the terms EPA and DHA in connection with fish oil-containing preparations. Document D9, in turn, states that the designations ""EPA"" and ""DHA"" include free fatty acids, triglycerides, and other esters. Claim 1 of the patent, however, only names the terms ""EPA"" and ""DHA."" As can be seen from any chemical encyclopedia, EPA and DHA are unambiguous chemical designations for organic compounds with the functional group COOH, characterized by the following structural formulas:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

4.8 This argument does not convince the Board. There is no question that these structural formulas depict EPA and DHA in the form of their free acids and that this is general technical knowledge. Nevertheless, claim 1 does not encompass these structural formulas and does not otherwise define the terms ""eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)"" and ""docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)"" in more detail.

4.9 In summary, it can therefore be stated that the terms ""eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)"" and ""docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)"" used in claim 1 are ambiguous in the technical field of the claimed invention.

4.10 Accordingly, the description of the patent must be consulted for the interpretation of these terms. Relevant in this context are prima facie paragraphs [0033] and [0034], which assign the meaning of free acids to the terms ""eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)"" and ""docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)."" However, upon further reading of the description, the skilled person would find that the aforementioned terms are also used in connection with triglycerides. Paragraph [0131] teaches that the emulsion Omegaven®, which according to paragraph [0095] is the most preferred embodiment of the claimed subject matter, is a highly purified fish oil that contains, among other things, ""eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)"" and ""docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).""

4.11 As stated above in point 4.6.1, it is known to the skilled person that fish oil contains EPA and DHA not as free acids but in the form of triglycerides. Accordingly, they would derive from the above passages of the description that the terms ""eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)"" and ""docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)"" in claim 1 are not to be understood exclusively as directed to the free acids of EPA and DHA, but also encompass EPA or DHA in the form of derivatives - such as triglyceride esters.

4.12 Furthermore, they would find that this interpretation is consistent with the teachings of documents D8 and D9.

4.13 Consequently, the skilled person would understand the claimed feature ""eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)"" as not limited to the free acids.

Regarding b) - Technical Meaning of the Claimed Feature ""wherein the composition is to be administered to the patient only 48 to 24 hours before the start of a cycle of chemotherapy or radiotherapy""

4.14 The Board has no doubts that the adverb ""only"" in the context of this disputed feature is to be understood clearly as ""not earlier than,"" and thus claim 1 excludes any further parenteral administration of the claimed composition before the stated period of 48 to 24 hours before the start of a cycle of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Accordingly, there is no need to interpret this feature in light of the description and drawings of the patent.

4.15 Even if the description were to be consulted for this purpose, it would confirm the interpretation of the adverb ""only"" made by the Board. In paragraph [0083] of the patent, the administration period of 48 to 24 hours before the start of a cycle of chemotherapy or radiotherapy is disclosed as particularly preferred compared to longer administration periods of 96 to 24 hours or 72 to 24 hours before the start of such a cycle. It is clear from this that the stated administration period of 48 to 24 hours before the start of a cycle of chemotherapy or radiotherapy excludes earlier administration of the composition.

5. Executability of the Claimed Invention (Article 100(b) EPC)

5.1 According to the established case law of the Boards of Appeal, a successful objection of insufficient disclosure requires serious and verifiable doubts. The burden of proof for establishing insufficient disclosure in inter partes proceedings initially lies with the opponent, who must demonstrate that, upon weighing the probabilities, a skilled reader of the patent would not be able to carry out the invention based on their general technical knowledge. If the opponent meets this burden of proof, the patent proprietor, who attempts to refute these convincingly substantiated facts with counterarguments, bears the burden of proof for this (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 10th edition, 2022, II.C.9).

5.2 In the present case, the facts and arguments presented by the appellant are not suitable to raise justified doubts about the executability of the claimed invention. The reasons are as follows.

Objection of lack of plausibility of the claimed therapeutic effects

5.3 Claim 1 is formulated as a purpose-limited product claim according to Article 54 (5) EPC. According to the established case law of the Boards of Appeal, the achievement of the claimed therapeutic effect is regarded as a functional technical feature of such a claim. To meet the requirement of sufficient disclosure, the therapeutic efficacy of the composition for the claimed therapeutic indication must be made plausible.

5.4 According to the appellant, the patent does not meet this requirement. They argued that the results presented in examples 5 and 8 of the patent (see paragraphs [0139] and [0143] as well as paragraphs [0161] and [0163]) are merely blanket, unqualified statements. These provide only a random picture and cannot thus serve as evidence for a scientifically relevant technical effect. Furthermore, the experiments described in examples 5 to 8 of the patent are inadequately specified due to the lack of indication of sample sizes.

5.5 However, the Board notes that examples 5 and 8 of the patent (i.e., examples 5 and 8 of the application) report in detail on in vivo studies investigating the influence of a claimed, intravenously administered fish oil emulsion containing EPA and DHA in the form of triglyceride esters (Omegaven®) on the efficacy and side effects of chemotherapy (example 5) or radiotherapy (example 8) in a mouse model of human colorectal cancer. According to paragraphs [0139], [0143], [0161], and [0163] of the patent, it is shown that the animals treated with Omegaven® exhibit a lower mean tumor volume and less pronounced chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-induced side effects than a control group treated with an intravenous soybean oil emulsion (Lipovenös®).

5.6 Furthermore, the patent or the application describes in examples 6 and 7 cell culture experiments in which various carcinoma cell lines are initially cultured for two days in a medium containing 0 µM, 20 µM, 50 µM, or 100 µM DHA or EPA and then irradiated with a single radiation dose of 0 Gy (control), 2 Gy, 4 Gy, and 6 Gy. Subsequently, the surviving cell fraction is determined in relation to the untreated controls. Figures 4A and 4B show that all EPA and DHA concentrations examined in example 6, except for 20 µM DHA, enhance the cancer cell-killing effect of the respective radiation dose applied.

5.7 The Board agrees with the appellant that the experimental results of examples 5 and 8 are not supported by experimental data and that the sample sizes are not specified. Nevertheless, these facts alone do not suffice to raise doubts regarding the suitability of the claimed compositions for the claimed medical indications without further justification.

5.8 The other criticisms of the appellant regarding the disclosure content of examples 6 and 7 and the figures 4A and 4B of the patent or the application (see above in point VIII.e)) are also unconvincing. The reasons are as follows.

5.8.1 The appellant argued, among other things, that it is unclear in what form EPA and DHA were tested in these examples. At the same time, they referred in the oral proceedings to figures 4A and 4B as evidence for a cytotoxic effect of EPA and DHA in the form of their free acids. In this respect, this argument is not coherent.

5.8.2 However, the appellant's statement that EPA and DHA were tested individually in examples 6 and 7 is correct. Nevertheless, the Board sees no reason to question the transferability of the data shown in figures 4A and 4B to combinations of EPA and DHA in the absence of a substantiated presentation by the appellant.

5.8.3 Regarding the experimental results presented in figures 4A and 4B of the patent (see above in point VIII.e)i) and iii)), the Board does not dispute the significance of the depicted error bars nor the lower cytotoxicity of cancer cells pretreated with 20 µM DHA and irradiated with 2 Gy compared to untreated cells also irradiated with 2 Gy. However, this does not change the fact that a clear trend towards an EPA- or DHA-induced improvement of the cytotoxic effect of radiotherapy is evident when considering these figures as a whole.

5.8.4 Concerning the different survival rates of the untreated cells in figures 4A and 4B of the patent or in figure 1 of document D12 (see above in point VIII.e)ii)), the respondent convincingly demonstrated in the oral proceedings that these differences are due to the fact that the tested cells, while belonging to the same cell line, are not exactly identical.

5.9 For the above reasons, the Board concludes that the objection of lack of plausibility of the claimed therapeutic effects is not justified.

Objection of lack of executability based on the argument that EPA and DHA in the form of their free acids are toxic to healthy body cells.

5.10 Referring to documents D1 and D3 to D5, the appellant argued that the parenteral administration of EPA and DHA in the form of their free acids is toxic to healthy body cells.

5.11 However, these documents are not suitable to support this assertion. The reasons are as follows.

Document D1

5.11.1 To support their argument, the appellant referred to the paragraph spanning the left and right columns of page 1961.

5.11.2 This paragraph deals generally with limits for free fatty acids in connection with injectable fat emulsions (see heading) and cites soybean oil-based fat emulsions as an example.

5.11.3 Furthermore, this paragraph states that the pharmacopoeial limit for free fatty acids of <= 0.07 mEq/g largely relates to changes in the stability of the triglycerides present in the fat emulsions but also stems from some concerns regarding systemic toxicity. For instance, in dogs, systemic anomalies in blood and liver occurred after parenteral administration of free fatty acids derived from hydrolyzed lecithin. Additionally, intravenous infusion of free fatty acids in rabbits led to pulmonary edema and respiratory damage (see page 1961, column 1, penultimate line to column 2, line 3).

5.11.4 However, this paragraph does not disclose either EPA or DHA but merely refers to ""free fatty acids."" This term encompasses a variety of structurally different fatty acids. For example, the soybean oil mentioned in document D1 contains the quantitatively most important long-chain fatty acids linoleic acid (omega-6 fatty acid), oleic acid (monounsaturated fatty acid), palmitic acid (saturated fatty acid), linolenic acid (omega-3 fatty acid), and stearic acid (saturated fatty acid).

5.11.5 In this context, it cannot be derived from the paragraph spanning columns 1 and 2 on page 1961 of document D1 that the described systemic toxicity also applies to EPA and DHA. Consequently, this paragraph is not suitable to substantiate the appellant's claim of the toxic effect of EPA and DHA in the form of their free acids.

Documents D3 to D5

5.11.6 These documents are also not relevant. Documents D3 and D5 (see headings) deal with the cytotoxic effect of fatty acids on cancer cells. Document D4 (see summary) concerns the cytotoxicity of other fatty acids (oleic acid, palmitic acid).

5.12 In the oral proceedings, the appellant additionally referred to documents D6 and D7 as support for the alleged toxic effect of EPA and DHA in the form of their free acids, without providing specific references. Accordingly, this presentation must be disregarded due to lack of substantiation.

5.13 In summary, it can therefore be stated that in the absence of evidence for the alleged cytotoxicity of EPA and DHA in the form of their free acids towards healthy body cells, the appellant's presentation in this regard cannot raise serious doubts about the executability of the claimed invention.

5.14 Accordingly, the Board concludes that the ground for opposition under Article 100 b) EPC does not preclude the maintenance of the patent in the granted version.

6. Inventive Step (Article 100 a) EPC in conjunction with Article 56 EPC)

Closest Prior Art

6.1 In the appeal proceedings, the appellant based their argumentation on document D8 as the closest prior art. The Board sees no reason to deviate from this.

6.2 Document D8 relates to the use of fish oil-containing dietary supplements to minimize the side effects of chemotherapies and radiotherapies and to improve the efficacy of these therapies (see paragraphs [0004], [0049]). According to claim 1 of this document, the fish oil contains EPA in a minimum amount of 30% of the total volume and DHA in a minimum amount of 10% of the total volume. The administration of the fish oil-containing dietary supplement preferably begins 14 to 5 days before cancer therapy and may be continued during the therapy (see claim 8 of document D8). The dietary supplement can be administered enterally or parenterally (see claim 12 of document D8).

Difference(s) from Document D8

6.3 It is undisputed that the subject matter of claim 1 differs from document D8 at least in that the claimed composition is to be administered only 48 to 24 hours before the start of a cycle of chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

Objective Technical Problem and Solution

6.4 In favor of the appellant, the Board assumes that starting from document D8, the objective technical problem is to provide an alternative therapy to improve the efficacy of radiation and chemotherapy while simultaneously reducing side effects.

6.5 As a solution to this problem, a therapy according to claim 1 is proposed.

6.6 The Board has no reason to doubt that this problem is solved across the entire breadth of claim 1. The argument presented in this context by the appellant, that the effect allegedly shown for Omegaven® in the patent is not plausible across the entire breadth of claim 1 in light of table I of document D8 and general technical knowledge (see above in point VIII.f, last paragraph), is not convincing. As the heading of table I of document D8 clearly indicates, this table relates exclusively to enteral preparations. Furthermore, the appellant has not provided evidence for the claimed toxicity and oversaturation after parenteral administration of large amounts of EPA and DHA.

Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

6.7 The Board is convinced that document D8 does not suggest the solution proposed in claim 1.

6.8 The concept of pre-treating a cancer patient with EPA- and DHA-containing compositions to minimize side effects in chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to improve the efficacy of these therapies is already known from document D8 (see above in point 6.2). According to claim 8 of this document, the administration of such agents preferably begins 14 to 5 days before cancer therapy and may be continued during the therapy. Moreover, document D8 provides in paragraphs [0099] and [0164] (see lines 1 to 6 with identical content) the guidance to start the administration of the dietary supplement at least 1 week, preferably 2 weeks, before the start of the actual treatment and to continue this administration throughout the entire treatment duration. According to the first two lines of paragraphs [0099] and [0164], this guidance applies generally to all dietary supplements described as inventive in document D8. This includes both enterally and parenterally administered compositions (see claim 12 of document D8, which refers back to claim 8).

6.9 In light of this teaching, the Board agrees with the appellant that the administration periods proposed in document D8 encompass the claimed administration period.

6.10 However, the conclusion drawn by the appellant that the latter is an arbitrary selection from the administration period disclosed in document D8 is not shared by the Board. From the guidance mentioned above in point 6.8 of document D8, the skilled person would derive that the parenteral administration of the EPA- and DHA-containing dietary supplement must begin at least 5 days before the start of the actual cancer therapy (""pre-treatment"") in order to reduce the side effects of chemotherapies and radiotherapies and to improve the efficacy of these therapies. In other words, document D8 teaches that a pre-treatment duration of at least 5 days is required for these therapeutic effects to occur.

6.11 Based on this teaching, the skilled person would expect that shortening the pre-treatment duration to a maximum of 48 hours before the start of the actual cancer therapy would lead to a loss of these therapeutic effects. Accordingly, they would not consider such a shortening as a solution to the problem posed and thus would not arrive at the claimed subject matter in an obvious manner.

6.12 For completeness, the Board points out that the passage cited by the appellant in paragraph [0083] of the patent or on page 16, paragraph 2 of the application cannot support the appellant's claim of arbitrary selection, as it does not belong to the prior art in the sense of Article 54 (2) EPC.

Conclusion on the Inventive Step of the Main Request

6.13 In light of the above considerations, the Board concludes that the ground for opposition under Article 100 a) EPC in conjunction with Article 56 EPC does not preclude the maintenance of the patent in the granted version.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",opposition rejected,opposition rejected,appeal dismissed,B.

V. By letter dated October 16, 2020, the opponent withdrew their opposition.

VI. By letter dated March 19, 2021, Zentiva k.s. announced its accession to the proceedings (Article 105 EPC). The acceding party will subsequently be referred to as Opponent 9.

By letter dated August 31, 2021, the appellant responded to the accession. They submitted auxiliary requests 1 to 14 and document (72) once again.

VII. An oral hearing took place on March 7, 2022, in the absence of opponents 2, 3, and 8 (opponents 2, 3, and 8). They had informed by letters dated February 28, 2022, and October 5, 2021, and February 17, 2022, that they would not attend the oral hearing.

VIII. The arguments presented by the appellant in the written proceedings as well as during the oral hearing, insofar as they are relevant to this decision, can be summarized as follows:

Main Request - Unallowable Extension

The synergistic effect of the claimed triple combination is part of the overall disclosure of the application as originally filed. This can already be inferred from the heading of Table 1. The passage on page 23, starting from line 16, also reveals the general conclusion that this combination achieves a synergistic effect, as clarified by the wording ""the three components enhance each other's effects."" This is confirmed by the statement on page 24, lines 2 to 6. Here it is disclosed that the combination of the three compounds leads to a highly significant reduction in thrombus weight, and thus the triple combination significantly improves antithrombotic therapy. The word ""therefore"" clearly establishes the connection to the preceding discussion of the synergistic effect, and the conclusion drawn is presented independently of the experimental circumstances, whether specific active substances or doses. The occurrence of synergy depends solely on the substances involved in a combination and their properties. The three claimed active substances represent the preferred ones. Also relevant is the disclosure on page 2, lines 20 to 26. Here it is clearly pointed out that the triple combination is superior to both the individual compounds and all possible double combinations. This representation of synergy corresponds to the understanding of synergy according to the ""Highest Single Agent Approach,"" thus being a disclosure of synergy without connection to subtherapeutic doses. Furthermore, the term ""potent"" in the phrase ""potent synergistic antithrombotic effect"" on page 17, line 15, conveys a classification within the concept of ""potency,"" which captures the amount of active substance relative to an effect of a certain magnitude as a measure. This means that low doses of factor Xa inhibitors lead to a highly effective synergistic antithrombotic combination. Therefore, the technical feature ""synergistic antithrombotic effect"" is not an intermediate generalization.

Auxiliary Request 1 - Clarity

While it is correct that the term ""therapeutic dose"" and thus also the term ""subtherapeutic dose"" depends on the indication, this does not lead to a lack of clarity in claim 1 of auxiliary request 1. This follows from the fact that claims relating to a first medical indication, i.e., claims in which achieving the (indeterminate) therapeutic effect is a feature of the claim, are not considered unclear despite the implied dose. Since, therefore, an (implied) therapeutic dose is clear regardless of the medical indication, this must also apply to subtherapeutic doses.

Document (72) - Admission

Since document (72) was submitted in response to the accession, there is no legal basis to consider this document as not being part of the proceedings.

Auxiliary Request 2 - Inventive Step

The next state of the art is document (8). However, if one starts from document (2), which already discloses a synergistic combination of 5-Chloro-N-({(5S)-2-oxo-3-[4-(3-oxo-4-morpholinyl)phenyl]-1,3-oxazolidin-5-yl}methyl)-2-thiophene carboxamide (Rivaroxaban) and Clopidogrel and considers the effects shown in document (4), the objective technical problem is to provide an improved antithrombotic therapy with acceptable bleeding risk or without excessive bleeding risk. However, it was by no means obvious for the skilled person to combine document (2) with document (7) or document (8). Considering the bleeding risk, which always represents the downside of this type of therapy (see document (72)), and considering the close intertwining of mechanistic aspects (see documents (25) and (33)), the skilled person would not have had a reasonable expectation of success. At most, ""hope for success"" can be acknowledged. On the one hand, there is no incentive to develop a triple combination starting from document (2), and on the other hand, the skilled person would have had serious concerns regarding the bleeding risk. The (increased) bleeding risk is the main side effect of any treatment with antithrombotic effect and decisive for whether a treatment is suitable for use in patients. Considering the concerns of the skilled person, there can be no reasonable expectation of success without a well-founded prior assessment of the bleeding risk. Document (2) does not allow such an assessment even for the double combination, as only data on thrombus reduction is disclosed. Document (7), concerning a clinical Phase I study, can also contribute nothing here, as the experimental setup was chosen to keep the processes of platelet aggregation and coagulation separate. Document (7) also only refers to bleeding duration, which cannot be equated with bleeding risk. Document (8) refers in the last sentence of the first paragraph of the summary to the specific context underlying this document. An extrapolation of the effects to triple combinations is not possible. A combination of documents (2) and (8) requires a retrospective consideration.

Auxiliary Requests 3 to 14 - Inventive Step

No further arguments regarding the presence of an inventive step are presented for the subject matter of auxiliary requests 3 to 14.

IX. The arguments relevant to this decision, presented by the opponents in the written proceedings as well as during the oral hearing, and insofar as they are relevant to this decision, can be summarized as follows:

Main Request - Unallowable Extension

The application as originally filed does not contain a general disclosure of synergy. Synergy is only disclosed at two specific points, particularly regarding the amount of Rivaroxaban. The question of unallowable extension concerns the disclosure of synergy in the application as filed. Therefore, it is irrelevant what document (10) reveals about the determination of synergy in various experimental approaches. However, different experimental approaches lead to different results. Synergy is an over-additive phenomenon; terms that merely describe an improvement in effect do not disclose it.

Auxiliary Request 1 - Clarity

The term ""in subtherapeutically effective dose"" in a product claim without specifying a therapeutic indication is not clear, as the therapeutic dose depends on the indication. This is also the fundamental difference regarding a claim that relates to a first medical indication, as this implicitly restricts to an effective dose or does not explicitly define any dose.

Document (72) - Admission

Document (72) was submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal. However, there was no reason for this submission in the opposition proceedings. Even if one considers the resubmission of this document in response to the accession, the document would not be admitted, as no new facts were presented in the accession statement.

Auxiliary Request 2 - Inventive Step

Document (2) is the next state of the art. Document (4) is not suitable to demonstrate an effect based on the addition of acetylsalicylic acid. The technical problem is therefore either an alternative combination for the treatment of thrombosis or an improved combination for the same treatment. Document (2) already discloses the possibility of combining more than two active substances (paragraph [0011]). There is no indication in the literature that the bleeding risk would deter the skilled person from further combinations. Document (72) is merely an expert opinion that is not supported by literature citations. The solution to the technical problem is obvious, as document (8) already discloses the combination of acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel with improved effect and without further bleeding risk. Document (7) also describes that there are no concerns regarding bleeding tendency.

Auxiliary Requests 3 to 14 - Inventive Step

The previously presented arguments also apply mutatis mutandis to subject matters that include the feature that ""the combination is administered in a total amount of 0.001 to 10 mg/kg per 24 hours."" No advantageous effect for this feature has been demonstrated. Animal models are also already known from the state of the art, and the use of a known method to determine the antithrombotic effect does not contribute to inventive step.

X. The appellant (patent holder) requests the annulment of the contested decision, the rejection of the opposition, and the maintenance of the patent in the granted version (main request), or, alternatively, the maintenance of the patent in the scope of one of auxiliary requests 1 to 14, submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal.

Opponents 1, 2, 4, and 6 to 8 request that the appeal be dismissed. Opponent 9 requests that the patent be revoked.

Opponent 3 has not made any requests in the appeal proceedings.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. The intervention is admissible. This was not disputed.

3. Absence in Oral Proceedings

According to Rule 115(2) EPC, the oral proceedings may be conducted in the absence of duly summoned parties. In accordance with Article 15(3) RPBA, the written submissions of respondents 2 and 5 are taken into account. Respondent 3 did not make any submissions in the appeal proceedings.

4. Admission of Document (72) and Auxiliary Requests

4.1 Document (72) was submitted with the statement of appeal and again with the statement on the intervention within the time limit set by the Board. According to the appellant, this document does not require separate admission because it was submitted in response to the intervention of the third party and is thus (automatically) part of the proceedings. To support this view, the appellant referred, among other things, to decision T 2034/19. In the present proceedings, it is not procedurally relevant whether the Board follows T 2034/19. However, it is noted that new documents or requests submitted in response to an intervention under Article 105 EPC within the time limit set by the Board in opposition appeal proceedings can generally only be considered without further ado if they represent a reaction to a substantive presentation of the intervenor that goes beyond the content of the arguments, objections, factual assertions, and evidence already in the proceedings. In the present case, the Board has concluded that the submission of document D72 by the appellant meets these requirements, but this does not require separate justification due to the outcome of the proceedings.

4.2 In light of the outcome of the appeal proceedings, questions concerning the admission of the auxiliary requests are not decisive. The auxiliary requests are considered to be pending in the proceedings.

5. Main Request - Impermissible Extension

Synergy or synergistic effect is mentioned in the application as filed only at two points, on the one hand on page 17, in a passage that includes lines 13 to 22, and on the other hand on pages 23 and 24, in connection with the data of Table 1.

The passage on page 17 explicitly associates the synergistic antithrombotic effect with a ""low-dose FXa inhibitor, such as Rivaroxaban (Example 44)."" The last sentence of this paragraph also refers to low doses, namely those that do not show any antithrombotic effect when used alone. This passage therefore explicitly reveals a synergistic antithrombotic effect solely for low-dose Rivaroxaban. The wording of this passage does not imply a disclosure of synergy for Rivaroxaban at any dosage. The qualification of the synergistic effect as ""potent"" does not change this.

The second passage of particular interest concerns Table 1 and the following paragraph. The heading for Table 1 reads: ""Table 1: Synergistic antithrombotic effect of the combination of an oxazolidinone of formula (I) with acetylsalicylic acid and an ADP receptor antagonist."" However, this heading does not constitute a standalone and thus potentially general disclosure, but rather information that directly relates to the data contained in Table 1. This data concerns Rivaroxaban in a (single) dosage that shows no effect. Following the tabular representation, there is a paragraph discussing the content of Table 1, as is clearly indicated by the introductory wording, ""As shown in Table 1."" Here, the combination of Rivaroxaban with acetylsalicylic acid and an ADP receptor blocker, such as Clopidogrel, is attributed a synergistic effect, and this occurrence of a synergistic effect is emphasized by a subsequent explanation (""i.e., the three components enhance each other's effects""). However, it is explicitly pointed out that Rivaroxaban in single dosage is ineffective (page 23, line 18 to page 24, line 2). The following sentences undoubtedly belong to the previously discussed disclosure, as they are contextually linked by the terms ""on the other hand"" or ""therefore"" (page 24, lines 2 to 6). A wording that directly refers to experimental data is, of course, to be read in light of the facts underlying the experimental setup. Since Table 1 refers to specific doses that do not achieve an effect when used alone, there is also no disclosure of synergy for Rivaroxaban at any dosage.

Since synergy is generally characterized as an over-additive phenomenon, more general terms, such as ""interesting,"" ""better suited,"" ""improved,"" or ""significant,"" cannot describe such a phenomenon. Furthermore, wording that does not explicitly refer to synergy cannot implicitly disclose it if no indication is given in the relevant passage. Thus, the passage on page 2, lines 20 to 26, does not connect the term ""better suited"" with a test system suitable for determining synergy (such as the ""Highest Single Agent Approach"" cited by the appellant, see document (10), page 2, left column, from the heading ""Effect-Based Strategy""). The terms used on page 2 are therefore to be understood in their usual meaning. However, this interpretation does not reveal any synergy.

The disclosure of the occurrence of synergy in the application as filed is thus limited to combinations that contain low-dose Rivaroxaban. There is no passage in the application as filed that suggests that this observed synergy for specific dosing regimens also manifests itself when administering the triple combination of these active substances at any dosage. The appellant's argument that the occurrence of synergy depends solely on the substances involved in a combination and their properties does not change the disclosure in the application, which, as elaborated, describes synergy only in the context of specific dosages.

Consequently, a synergistic antithrombotic effect is not directly and unambiguously disclosed for any dosage of Rivaroxaban in the application as originally filed.

The subject matter of claim 1 of the main request therefore extends beyond the content of the application as originally filed (Article 100(c) EPC).

6. Auxiliary Request 1 - Clarity

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 is a product claim. It does not contain any limitation in the sense of Article 54(4) or (5) EPC. The term ""subtherapeutic"" functionally defines a dose at which no therapeutic efficacy occurs. However, due to the functional definition, this dose is only accessible if the therapeutic treatment is also defined. This is not the case in claim 1. It is therefore unclear how the term ""subtherapeutic"" quantitatively restricts the claimed dose of Rivaroxaban in claim 1.

A direct comparison of a product claim with a purpose-limited compound claim that defines a first medical indication is not possible. While the product claim in the present case defines the combination of active substances, one of which is functionally restricted in its amount in an indefinite manner (due to the absence of the medical indication), a purpose-limited claim implies the amount to be used through that very purpose in the form of a medical indication. Consequently, the presence of a technical feature that defines the ""purpose"" fundamentally changes the situation.

The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 is therefore not clearly defined (Article 84 EPC).

7. Auxiliary Request 2 - Inventive Step

7.1 The contested patent relates to a combination of Rivaroxaban, an oxazolidinone that acts as a selective inhibitor of coagulation factor Xa and as an anticoagulant, with acetylsalicylic acid and Clopidogrel for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of thromboembolic diseases (paragraphs [0001], [0002], [0005], and [0007] to [0009]).

7.2 For determining the closest prior art in the assessment of inventive step, it is initially irrelevant whether a specific disclosure is closer or further away from the claimed subject matter. The fact that the problem-solution approach focuses on a ""closest prior art"" serves merely to avoid having to consider a multitude of potential starting points in every case. It is to be assumed that a specific subject matter must be recognized as inventive if it is considered inventive starting from this ""closest prior art."" With respect to Article 56 EPC, a claimed invention can only be regarded as based on an inventive step if it does not arise in an obvious manner from the prior art, i.e., from any prior art in the sense of Article 56, second sentence, EPC.

Any document, especially if it concerns the prophylaxis and/or treatment of thromboembolic diseases, can therefore serve as a starting point for consideration. It may be necessary to carry out the problem-solution approach starting from several documents.

The contested decision analyzes documents (2) and (8) as possible closest prior art. The reasoning regarding the absence of an inventive step is based on document (2) as the closest prior art. This approach in the decision underlying the appeal is therefore reviewed by the Board in the following.

7.3 Document (2) discloses a combination of oxazolidinones of formula (I) with other active substances and the use of this combination for the prophylaxis or treatment of thromboembolic diseases (paragraph [0001]), particularly for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of reocclusions and restenoses after coronary interventions such as angioplasty or aortocoronary bypass (claim 9). In paragraph [0233], it is described that the oxazolidinones of formula (I) can be administered in addition to inhibitors of platelet aggregation, such as aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, or antagonists of the fibrinogen receptor, with the simultaneous inhibition of coagulation and platelet aggregation leading to an improved antithrombotic effect. This is subsequently taken up in paragraph [0267], which points to a synergistic effect of Rivaroxaban and Clopidogrel, with both active substances being used at a dose that is ineffective when administered alone (Table 2).

The difference between the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 and the disclosure of document (2) is therefore the mandatory presence of acetylsalicylic acid.

7.4 The technical effect associated with the addition of acetylsalicylic acid is regarded in favor of the appellant as an improved antithrombotic therapy. It is also assumed in favor of the appellant that the triple combination of Rivaroxaban, acetylsalicylic acid, and Clopidogrel has an acceptable bleeding risk.

The technical problem to be solved is therefore seen as providing a combination with improved antithrombotic effect in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of reocclusions and restenoses after coronary interventions such as angioplasty or aortocoronary bypass.

In the present case, the Board assumes in the assessment of inventive step that the specific application, namely the therapeutic treatment, takes place effectively and safely. It is therefore not necessary to explicitly address side effects that could significantly impair safety. Safety in the form of an acceptable bleeding risk is treated in the present case as an implicit feature of the treatment.

The problem is considered to be solved.

7.5 The question now arises whether the skilled person would have considered the addition of acetylsalicylic acid to solve the above-formulated technical problem. In particular, it must be considered whether the skilled person would have selected this active substance and whether they would have had safety concerns.

To achieve an improvement in antithrombotic effect, the skilled person would undoubtedly have considered the addition of an active substance known for this use. They would therefore have considered the addition of acetylsalicylic acid, which is disclosed in document (8) in combination with Clopidogrel for use as an antithrombotic agent in cardiological indications.

Naturally, the skilled person would have kept the bleeding risk in mind. Document (8) provides some reassurance here by stating that no excessive increase in bleeding complications is observed with the combined administration of Clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (summary, last sentence of the first paragraph). It remains for the skilled person to assess whether the situation regarding the bleeding risk could change concerning the triple combination. However, no warning of any kind can be inferred from document (8).

Document (7) is titled: ""Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacodynamics, and Pharmacokinetics of Rivaroxaban - an Oral, Direct Factor Xa Inhibitor - Are not Affected by Aspirin."" It states that aspirin does not influence the effect of Rivaroxaban. Furthermore, Rivaroxaban does not influence the effects of acetylsalicylic acid, nor the bleeding time (summary). In the discussion, it is noted that bleeding times vary greatly among different patients. However, since the addition of Rivaroxaban to acetylsalicylic acid does not affect platelet aggregation, this indicates no increase in bleeding risk (page 988, left column, first paragraph). The appellant has argued that the experimental setup of document (7) does not allow for such a conclusion. However, since this document explicitly, see title, investigates the influence of acetylsalicylic acid on Rivaroxaban, the skilled person would have at least inferred from this document that no mutual influence on bleeding risk at a mechanistic level is necessarily to be expected.

7.6 The skilled person would thus have had the expectation that the addition of acetylsalicylic acid to the combination of Rivaroxaban and Clopidogrel would increase the antithrombotic efficacy and, on the other hand, would not have had safety concerns, particularly regarding the bleeding risk, that would oppose such a triple combination.

Consequently, they would have added another antithrombotic agent, specifically acetylsalicylic acid, to the combination of document (2) and thus arrived at the claimed subject matter.

7.7 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 is not inventive (Article 56 EPC).

7.8 Further Arguments

7.8.1 The appellant argued that the skilled person would have been aware that the mechanistic action of Rivaroxaban as a factor Xa inhibitor is closely related to platelet aggregation, which is influenced by Clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid. Due to this mechanistic interplay, predictions regarding the bleeding risk would not be possible.

Direct factor Xa inhibitors, such as Rivaroxaban, influence the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin (see document (25), Figure 2). Thrombin influences platelet aggregation (see document (33), Figure 1). The Board agrees with the appellant to the extent that all three active substances of the claimed triple combination influence coagulation and thus the bleeding risk. However, this does not lead to the direct conclusion that combining one or more active substances that exert their effect in the context of coagulation necessarily results in an unacceptable bleeding risk. In the present case, there is no indication of such an unacceptable bleeding risk. On the contrary, documents (8) and (7) assess the bleeding risk for the respective examined dual combinations positively.

7.8.2 Furthermore, the appellant stated that document (7), being a clinical phase I study, does not allow conclusions regarding efficacy and safety. Neither are patients, particularly older patients with pre-existing conditions, treated, nor is chronic treatment addressed.

As belonging to a clinical phase I study, the results of document (7) cannot guarantee absolute safety; however, they can certainly provide an indication of drug combinations with acceptable side effects. The assessment of side effects or safety is an important reason for conducting clinical phase I studies. The fact that older patients and/or those with pre-existing conditions are not treated in a clinical phase I study does not change the generally known purpose of such a study, nor its assessment by the skilled person. The skilled person would therefore have taken the teachings of document (7) into account.

7.8.3 The appellant argued that the skilled person would not have had a reasonable expectation of success. A ""hope for success"" would be maximally present. However, this is not sufficient to consider a modification of the closest prior art.

In principle, it can be assumed that a skilled person who adds another active substance with the desired effect expects an additive effect. The documents cited by the parties do not raise any concerns; rather, they spread optimism regarding the bleeding risk of combinations of platelet aggregation inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors. Since the bleeding risk, as can be seen from document (72), is one of the most important safety aspects in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of thromboembolic diseases, the skilled person would therefore have indeed demonstrated a reasonable expectation of success.

8. Auxiliary Requests 3 to 14

8.1 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 is limited to the prophylaxis of reocclusions and restenoses after coronary interventions such as angioplasty or aortocoronary bypass. This limitation does not change the reasoning given in point 7, as the closest prior art already includes the use for prophylaxis.

8.2 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 4 concerns low-dose Rivaroxaban in a triple combination administered in a total amount of 0.001 to 10 mg/kg per 24 hours for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of thromboembolic diseases.

The closest prior art already concerns thromboembolic diseases, and the reasoning presented in point 7 therefore applies mutatis mutandis, whereby the technical problem is to be broadened to the treatment/prophylaxis of thromboembolic diseases in general. A demonstrated effect for a subtherapeutic dose undoubtedly raises the expectation that the administration of ""low-dose"" active substance will also lead to a treatment success. Regarding the total amount of the triple combination, it is added that this has not been associated with an unexpected effect, does not seem unusual (see contested decision, page 33, second paragraph), and it is otherwise part of the routine tasks of the skilled person to determine the correct dosage through routine trials.

8.3 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 5 is restricted compared to auxiliary request 4 to the more specific medical indication of claim 1 of auxiliary request 2, which is further restricted to prophylaxis in claim 1 of auxiliary request 6. Therefore, the statements made in points 8.2 and 8.1 apply accordingly.

8.4 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 7 differs from claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 by omitting the term ""in subtherapeutically effective dose."" The omission of this feature does not prompt a change in the reasoning given in point 7, which also applies unchanged to auxiliary request 7, since a reasoning that concerns a specific dose naturally also applies to the use of the active substance without restriction to a specific dose.

8.5 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 8 corresponds to the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 7, limited to prophylaxis. Therefore, the statements made in points 8.4 and 8.1 apply accordingly.

8.6 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 9 concerns the triple combination of Rivaroxaban, acetylsalicylic acid, and Clopidogrel, whereby the synergistic antithrombotic effect is demonstrable in a specific animal model.

The manner in which synergy is demonstrable does not influence the essential technical features relevant for inventive step in the present case, namely the presence of a combination of Rivaroxaban, acetylsalicylic acid, and Clopidogrel with a synergistic antithrombotic effect, which, as already stated in point 7, is not inventive. Regarding the absence of the term ""in subtherapeutically effective dose,"" reference is made to point 8.4.

8.7 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 10 differs from claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 by omitting the term ""in subtherapeutically effective dose."" Furthermore, it is defined that the synergistic antithrombotic effect is demonstrable in a specific animal model.

The manner in which synergy is demonstrable does not influence the essential technical features relevant for inventive step in the present case, namely the presence of a combination of Rivaroxaban, acetylsalicylic acid, and Clopidogrel with a synergistic antithrombotic effect, which, as already stated in point 7, is not inventive. The omission of the feature ""in subtherapeutically effective dose"" also does not lead to any change in the reasoning given in point 7, see point 8.4.

8.8 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 11 is limited, compared to auxiliary request 10, to the prophylaxis of reocclusions and restenoses after coronary interventions such as angioplasty or aortocoronary bypass. This limitation does not change the reasoning given in points 7 and 8.7, as the closest prior art already concerns the use for prophylaxis.

8.9 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 12 corresponds to the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 9, whereby the dose of Rivaroxaban is defined as subtherapeutic. The reasoning given in points 7 and 8.6 applies to this auxiliary request.

8.10 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 13 corresponds to the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 2, whereby the synergistic antithrombotic effect is demonstrable in a specific animal model. The manner in which synergy is demonstrable does not influence the essential technical features relevant for inventive step in the present case, namely the presence of a combination of Rivaroxaban, acetylsalicylic acid, and Clopidogrel with a synergistic antithrombotic effect, which, as already stated in point 7, is not inventive.

8.11 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 14 differs from the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 13 by limiting it to the prophylaxis of reocclusions and restenoses after coronary interventions such as angioplasty or aortocoronary bypass. This limitation does not change the reasoning given in points 7 and 8.10, as the closest prior art already concerns the use for prophylaxis.

8.12 As can be seen from points 8.1 to 8.11, the respective claims 1 of auxiliary requests 3 to 14 do not contain features that could confer inventive step.

The subject matter of the respective claims 1 of auxiliary requests 3 to 14 is not inventive (Article 56 EPC).","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,"Generics [UK] Ltd, Abdi Ibrahim Ilac Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi, Denk Pharma GmbH & Co.

III. In the contested decision, the opposition division concluded that the claimed method for the purification of process gases containing carbon dioxide is sufficiently disclosed (Article 83 EPC). Furthermore, novelty (Article 54 EPC) and inventive step (Article 56 EPC) are given with respect to documents D1, D8, and D9.

IV. The appellant contested the conclusions of the opposition division on all three points. They requested the revocation of the patent. In this context, they requested that the auxiliary requests of the appellant not be admitted into the proceedings.

V. The respondent defended the decision of the opposition division. They requested that the appeal be dismissed. Alternatively, they requested that the patent be maintained in amended form, based on three auxiliary requests submitted during the oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal.

VI. The oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal took place on September 22, 2022. The Board issued a procedural order on June 13, 2022, under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020 with a preliminary assessment of the factual and legal situation. At the end of the oral proceedings, the decision was announced.

VII. The independent claim of the version of the patent maintained by the opposition division reads as follows:

""Method for the purification of carbon dioxide-containing process gases from the production of vinyl acetate by reacting ethylene with acetic acid and oxygen in heterogeneously catalyzed, continuous gas phase processes, characterized in that carbon dioxide-containing process gases are brought into contact with one or more washing solutions for the removal of carbon dioxide, wherein one or more washing solutions are alkaline media and

are included,

provided that the weight ratio of the oxides of metals of group I to the oxides of metals of group II is 1:1 to 2:1.""

The independent claim of the first auxiliary request contains limitations regarding the process operation and reads as follows (changes compared to the main request are underlined):

""Method for the purification of carbon dioxide-containing process gases from the production of vinyl acetate by reacting ethylene with acetic acid and oxygen in heterogeneously catalyzed, continuous gas phase processes, characterized in that carbon dioxide-containing process gases are brought into contact with one or more washing solutions located in a CO2 absorber for the removal of carbon dioxide, wherein one or more washing solutions are alkaline media and

The independent claim of the third auxiliary request combines the changes of the first and second auxiliary requests.

VIII. Regarding the decisive question of inventive step starting from D1, the parties essentially presented the following:

According to the appellant, the claimed method is suggested to the skilled person starting from D1. The distinguishing feature compared to D1 is only seen in the selection of the claimed weight ratios of vanadates and borates. Such a selection, however, is obvious unless it is associated with a surprising effect. None of the other cited documents would deter the skilled person from choosing a weight ratio as claimed.

The respondent, on the other hand, argued that the opposition division rightly recognized that the claimed method was not suggested starting from D1. D1 does not primarily deal with the composition of the absorption solutions used, but with a pressure swing process for CO2 absorption. Furthermore, the weight ratios of vanadates and borates defined in the claim are not suggested by D1. D9 would also advise the skilled person against using vanadates and borates in the claimed ratio.

IX. The arguments of the parties are detailed in the reasons for the decision.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

Version of the patent maintained by the opposition division

2.1 Closest prior art

2.1.1 The independent claim of the maintained version of the patent relates to a method for purifying CO2-containing process gases from the production of vinyl acetate. At least a portion of the process gases is brought into contact with alkaline washing solutions that contain certain vanadates and borates in a weight ratio of 1:1 to 2:1.

In the contested decision, inventive step was assessed based on both D8 and D1.

2.1.2 The Board considers D1 to be the document that represents the closest prior art. D1, like the contested patent, deals with the removal of CO2 from the circulating gas of a vinyl acetate synthesis plant, see for example ""summary of the invention"" on page 6, lines 20ff. In contrast to D8/D9, a specific method is described here that the skilled person can take as a starting point.

The respondent has disputed that D1 is suitable as a starting point for assessing inventive step. While D1 also addresses the issue of energy optimization in a method for purifying CO2-containing process gases from the production of vinyl acetate, it does not focus on the chemical composition of the washing solutions, but rather on the process management. In particular, a pressure swing method for CO2 absorption is described.

However, the Board believes that this rather concerns the question of whether the claimed method was obvious starting from D1. The suitability of D1 as a starting point is not called into question. Whether other documents, such as D8, would be more suitable as a starting point remains open, since, as will be elaborated, the claimed method was already suggested to the skilled person starting from D1.

2.2 Differences of the claimed method compared to D1

2.2.1 D1 describes, as mentioned above, the removal of CO2 from the circulating gas of a vinyl acetate synthesis plant. An alkaline potassium carbonate solution is used as a washing solution for CO2 absorption, which contains certain vanadates and borates as activators.

According to the general disclosure on page 7 of D1, this alkaline potassium carbonate solution contains between 3 and 30%, preferably 5-25% boric acid (corresponding to the claimed potassium borate, KBO2, in the present aqueous potassium carbonate solution) and between 0.1 and 20%, preferably 0.5 to 15% potassium metavanadate KVO3. Overall, the solution is supposed to have an activator content between 1 to 30%, see page 6, lines 32 to page 7, line 3.

In the examples of D1, vanadates are not used in the same or higher weight proportions as borates, as claimed here, but in lower proportions. In example 2, the weight ratio is 1:2.5. In the other examples, the excess of borates is even higher.

2.2.2 Therefore, the difference of the claimed method compared to the method known from D1 is that here the weight ratio of the oxides of metals of group I (vanadates) to the oxides of metals of group II (borates) is 1:1 to 2:1, as defined in the claim. This ratio is not specifically disclosed in D1.

In other words, vanadates are to be used here in the same ratio or in excess compared to the borates, whereas in the examples of D1, borates are used in excess.

2.3 Objective technical problem and its solution

2.3.1 The patent sets out in paragraph [0009] the objective of making the separation of CO2 from the process gases of vinyl acetate production more energy-efficient. D1 addresses the same problem, see for example page 6, first paragraph.

2.3.2 The pressure swing method used in D1 for this purpose is not part of the present claim, but it is also not excluded from it. The energy efficiency of the claimed method is justified in the patent by the addition of vanadates and borates to the alkaline washing solution, see paragraph [0010] and Table 1 in paragraph [0038]. The use of such washing solutions leads to improved CO2 absorption compared to solutions that contain neither borates nor vanadates.

2.3.3 However, the use of alkaline washing solutions to which vanadates and borates are added in energy-optimized methods for the separation of CO2 from the process gases of vinyl acetate production is already described in D1. A surprising additional effect that would be caused by the distinguishing feature compared to D1, i.e., the use of vanadates in excess, was neither claimed nor substantiated by the patent holder. There are no comparative data in the proceedings. Therefore, an increased energy efficiency of the claimed method compared to D1 cannot be used as a basis for establishing the objective technical problem.

2.3.4 The objective technical problem to be solved starting from D1 was therefore to find an alternative energy-efficient method for the separation of CO2 from the process gases of vinyl acetate production.

2.3.5 The claimed method, which is characterized by the use of vanadates in excess, solves this problem. This was undisputed.

2.4 Obviousness of the solution

2.4.1 Example 2 of D1, which is suitable as the closest example for the considerations of the skilled person, uses a ratio of vanadates to borates of 0.4:1.

However, according to the general description of D1, vanadate (as KVO3) can be present in the alkaline washing solution in weight proportions of 0.1-20% and borate (as boric acid) in weight proportions of 3 to 30%. The claimed ratio of vanadates to borates of 1:1 to 2:1 falls within the teaching of D1. Thus, a skilled person would have known from D1 that the claimed method is suitable for solving the technical problem. The appellant's assertion that the claimed method lacks inventive step starting from D1 is therefore correct.

The respondent has presented several counterarguments, which, however, cannot convince.

2.4.2 The respondent pointed out that the examples of D1 use borates in excess. The general ranges in the description also indicate this direction, as the limits of the ranges are set higher for borates than for vanadates. Furthermore, the general part of the description does not disclose any combination of the two activators, but only individual range specifications. A skilled person would therefore have drawn the conclusion from D1 that borates should be used in excess. In any case, he would have had no reason to use vanadates in excess.

It may be that such a reading of D1 suggests a tendency to use borates in excess. However, it is not the case that D1 advises against using borates in the same ratio or in deficit. The weight ratios of the two activators defined in the claim ultimately fall within the ranges specified in D1. This ratio is not given any further significance in D1, so that a skilled person would have considered the quantities specified there as suitable for carrying out the method. This is particularly true since the preceding paragraph to the general range specifications on page 6, lines 26-30, states that the composition of the washing solution can vary widely depending on other process parameters or the apparatus used. That the use of borates and vanadates is generally disclosed in combination in D1 is undeniable in light of the above-cited range specifications and the use of such combinations in all examples.

As long as the use of the claimed ratio between vanadates and borates is not associated with unexpected effects, the arguments of the respondent are irrelevant. There is no need for a specific motivation to work according to the claim; in the search for an alternative, the skilled person can certainly derive from D1 that he can change the composition of the washing solution within the specified ranges and that a method according to the claim solves the technical problem posed.

2.4.3 The respondent argued that D1 focuses on the apparatus or process optimization of CO2 absorption. Therefore, a skilled person would have had no reason to consider a change in the composition of the washing solution in the search for alternative energy-efficient methods, as no connection between the washing solution and energy efficiency is mentioned in D1.

This argument cannot be convincing. First, as already mentioned above, an increased energy efficiency compared to the washing solutions of the examples from D1 is not substantiated; this effect is therefore not part of the problem to be solved. Furthermore, a skilled person must only make a change in the composition of the washing solution compared to the examples of D1, but within their general teaching. It has been stated above that no inventive step is required for this.

Moreover, the pressure swing method described in D1 is included in the present claims, so that there is no difference starting from D1. It is therefore not the case that a method is claimed here that requires a change in the washing solution instead of the pressure swing method. Whether it would have been obvious for the skilled person to forgo the pressure swing method in search of alternatives starting from D1 does not need to be discussed.

2.4.4 The respondent also referred to documents D8 and D9. D8 and D9 would advise against the use of vanadates in excess.

D8 is a review article concerning the Benfield process for the removal of acidic gases, particularly CO2, from process gases of various synthesis processes using absorption in potassium carbonate solutions. The production of vinyl acetate is mentioned on page 36 as a possible such process. In the right column on page 37, a patented activator system described in D9 is referenced, which is said to have been used in various plants for the production of ethylene oxide or vinyl acetate.

D9 describes these activator systems, which contain mixtures of vanadates and borates. In particular, D9 describes in column 4, lines 12ff., that the ratio of KBO2 equivalents to V2O5 equivalents should be higher than 1.5:1. The respondent has also extracted from the tables of the examples of D9 why the use of the weight ratios described in D9, which do not fall under the present claims, is described as advantageous.

The appellant, in turn, has submitted calculations showing that the equivalent ratio disclosed in D9 of at least 1.5:1, when converted to the weight ratios used in the present claim, at least encompasses the use of equal amounts of vanadates and borates. She has also pointed to document D4, which comments on the results of D9 in column 1. In particular, it is stated there that surprisingly, contrary to the teaching of D9, increasing the vanadium content in the activator compositions described there leads to an improvement in CO2 absorption. Even if D4 does not explicitly refer to exhaust gases from vinyl acetate syntheses, the results of D9 are thereby refuted.

The Board does not consider a technical prejudice against the use of the claimed weight ratios to be substantiated in the context of documents D8/D9 and D4. The statement in D4 that other ratios than those in D9, in particular those according to the claim, could also be used, shows that there was no general prejudice. This is not changed by the fact that D4 does not explicitly refer to exhaust gases from vinyl acetate syntheses. On the one hand, this is equally true for D9, and on the other hand, D4 directly discusses the results of D9. A reference to the production of vinyl acetate made through D8 must therefore also apply to D4.

2.4.5 Overall, it can therefore be concluded that the skilled person operates within the teaching of D1 with the claimed method. There was no technical prejudice against the use of the claimed weight ratio of vanadates and borates. Since the use of these activator mixtures does not involve any unexpected effect compared to the mixtures used in the examples of D1, the claimed method does not go beyond the variations mentioned in D1 within its general teaching. No inventive contribution is required for this.

Auxiliary Request 2

2.5 In the independent claim of the second auxiliary request, some vanadates and borates have been removed compared to the main request. Specifically, NaVO3 and KV2O5 are mentioned as vanadates, and KBO2, K2B2O4, Na2B2O7, and K2B2O7 are mentioned as borates.

2.5.1 The respondent argued that the vanadates NaVO3 and KV2O5 defined in the claim are not described in D1. There, KVO3 is used.

2.5.2 However, the Board is convinced that this does not remedy the lack of inventive step existing for the main request.

NaVO3 and KVO3 can be used analogously in the washing solution. This is known to the skilled person and is explicitly stated in D9, see column 3, lines 34 to column 4, line 11.

2.5.3 Therefore, the method defined in claim 1 of the second auxiliary request also lacks inventive step starting from D1.

2.5.4 The appellant had already contested the admissibility of this request into the proceedings. Since the request is not grantable anyway, it does not need to be discussed further.

3. Admissibility of Auxiliary Requests 1 and 3 into the Appeal Proceedings.

3.1 Auxiliary Requests 1 and 3 were submitted during the oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal. They are based on the auxiliary requests 2 and 3 submitted with the response to the appeal. Claim 1 of these auxiliary requests was amended during the oral proceedings by deleting a feature from the part added regarding the main request, as follows:

wherein the sump of the CO2 absorber is fed to a CO2 desorber and the washing solution generated at the sump of the CO2 desorber is [deleted: at least partially] removed and returned to the CO2 absorber in the region of the head.

3.2 For the admissibility of amendments to the appeal submissions after receipt of the summons to the oral proceedings, i.e., also during the oral proceedings, the relevant Article 13(2) RPBA 2020 requires the demonstration of compelling reasons for the existence of exceptional circumstances.

3.3 In this context, the respondent argued that the deletion of ""at least partially"" from the claims submitted with the response to the appeal was due to an objection first raised by the appellant during the oral proceedings. According to this objection, the above-quoted feature added regarding the main request is already described in D1.

This is not convincing, as a corresponding novelty objection was at least already made in the appellant's submission of August 3, 2021, i.e., over a year before the date of the oral proceedings, in response to the submission of the auxiliary requests, see points 6.7 and 6.8 there.

3.4 The respondent further argued that the amendment would prima facie eliminate the objection of lack of inventive step made against D1. This is a criterion that should at least be examined under Article 13(1) RPBA 2020 and should also be applied analogously in the present case.

This is equally unconvincing. It would first need to be examined whether the deletion of the feature ""at least partially"" restricts the claimed method to the extent that a complete removal of the washing solution from the sump of the CO2 desorber is now required (Article 84 EPC) and, if so, whether such a method requiring complete removal was originally disclosed (Article 123(2) EPC). Both were disputed by the appellant during the oral proceedings. This alone shows that the request is not prima facie grantable, regardless of the extent to which this criterion may apply here.

3.5 Therefore, the auxiliary requests 1 and 3 submitted during the oral proceedings will not be admitted into the proceedings.

4. In summary, the patent in the form maintained by the opposition division does not meet the requirement of inventive step under Article 56 EPC. The same applies to auxiliary request 2. Auxiliary requests 1 and 3 are not admitted into the proceedings.

The patent is therefore to be revoked in accordance with Article 101(3)(b) EPC.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2.

I. The present decision concerns the appeal of the patent holder (appellant) against the interim decision of the opposition division (challenged decision), which found that European Patent No. 2 635 592 (patent in dispute) meets the requirements of the EPC in its amended form.

By letter dated April 28, 2022, the opponent withdrew their appeal and opposition. Consequently, they are no longer involved in the proceedings regarding the substantive issues. Therefore, they will be referred to as the former opponent.

II. The following documents from the proceedings before the opposition division are relevant to the present decision.

III. In preparation for the oral proceedings scheduled at the request of the appellant, the board issued a communication pursuant to Article 15 (1) RPBA 2020.

IV. By letter dated July 7, 2022, the appellant submitted, among other things, auxiliary request 1. This consists of a corresponding set of claims and a description adapted accordingly.

V. The oral proceedings before the board took place on July 21, 2022, in the presence of the appellant. The appellant made the auxiliary request 1 submitted by letter dated July 7, 2022, their main request and withdrew all other requests. At the end of the oral proceedings, the chairman announced the decision's operative part.

VI. Summaries of the relevant objections raised by the former opponent for the present decision can be found in the reasons for the decision.

According to the appellant, the method of claim 1 of the main request differs from those of D3, D10, and D12 in that it is based not only on one but on two basic transesterification steps. Furthermore, the objections raised by the former opponent against the granted claim 1 are not relevant for the main request.

VII. The appellant requested the annulment of the challenged decision and the maintenance of the patent in dispute in amended form based on claims 1 - 16 of the main request, submitted as auxiliary request 1 with the letter dated July 7, 2022, and the description submitted with the same letter.","Reasons for the Decision

Main Request

1. The claim set of the main request consists of 16 claims. These are divided into two groups of claims, namely

a) the independent method claim 1 and the dependent claims 2, 3, and 6 to 16

b) the independent method claim 4 and the dependent claims 5 and 6 to 16.

The claims of group b) are word-for-word identical to the claims that the opposition division found to be allowable in the contested decision. Therefore, the claims of group b) are not subject to review by the Board in the present case, where the patent proprietor is the sole appellant and thus the prohibition of reformatio in peius applies (G 9/92, No. 1 of the decision formula). It does not contradict this that the patent claim set of the main request includes, in addition to the claims found allowable by the opposition division in group b), the further claims of group a) (T 1626/11, No. 1.1 of the reasons for the decision and cited decisions therein).

Thus, the Board can only review the claims of group a), i.e., claims 1 to 3 and claims 6 to 16, insofar as they refer back to claims 1 to 3.

2. Claim 1 of the main request has the following wording (with changes marked compared to granted claim 1):

""Method for obtaining phytosterols and/or tocopherols from residues of a distillation of esters of vegetable oils [deleted: , preferably from distillation residues from a transesterification of vegetable oils, in particular from the vegetable oil-based fatty acid methyl ester production for the field of biodiesel (FAME)],

characterized by

a two-stage basic transesterification with an intermediate separation of glycerin phase,

wherein

- in a first basic transesterification stage, a reaction of partial glycerides contained in the distillation residues is carried out;

- glycerin phase is separated from a reaction mixture resulting directly from the first basic transesterification stage;

and

- in a second basic transesterification stage, a reaction of sterol esters contained in the reaction mixture is carried out

wherein the method is carried out as a two-stage base-catalyzed transesterification of a fatty acid methyl ester distillation residue from biodiesel production with an intermediate separation of glycerin phase generated during the transesterification to complete the glyceride conversion in the second reaction stage, without methanol or catalyst being removed by flashing, distilling, or washing.""

The method according to claim 1 of the main request thus comprises two basic transesterification stages and an intermediate separation of glycerin phase. The addition ""wherein the method ... removed"" (see the ten bolded lines at the end of the claim) clarifies that neither methanol nor catalyst is removed by flashing, distilling, or washing in the method.

3. Amendments and Clarity (Articles 123 (2), (3) and 84 EPC)

The Board has satisfied itself that claims 1 to 3 and claims 6 to 16, insofar as they refer back to claims 1 to 3, meet the requirements of Articles 123 (2), (3) and 84 EPC.

4. With the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant initially pursued the patent in its granted form as the main request. Furthermore, it submitted, among other things, auxiliary request 3.

The former opponent raised objections against granted claim 1 only regarding lack of novelty and lack of inventive step. It further stated that these objections would apply mutatis mutandis to claim 1 of auxiliary request 3.

Claim 1 of the aforementioned auxiliary request 3 is word-for-word identical to claim 1 of the now pending main request. The objections raised against granted claim 1 can therefore also be understood as directed against claim 1 of the now pending main request.

5. Novelty (Article 54 EPC)

5.1 The novelty objections of the former opponent against granted claim 1 were based on D1 to D3, D10, and D12.

Similar to the contested patent, these documents also relate to a method for obtaining phytosterols and/or tocopherols.

5.2 In contrast to the two basic transesterification stages provided for in claim 1 of the main request, the methods of D3 (claim 1; example 1), D10 (claim 1; example 1), and D12 (claim 1; example 1) involve at least in the first step an esterification of free fatty acids still present in the starting material with an alcohol. Such esterification can only occur under (possibly Lewis) acidic conditions. Contrary to claim 1 of the main request, the first stage in these documents is therefore not carried out under basic conditions.

5.3 The methods of D1 (claim 1; examples 1 and 2) and D2 (claim 1; example 6) proceed through two basic transesterification stages. Between the two transesterification stages, a significant amount of lower alcohol, namely methanol, is distilled off. However, the removal of methanol in the method is explicitly excluded in claim 1 of the main request, see above.

5.4 Thus, the subject matter of claim 1 and the dependent claims 2, 3, and 6 to 16, insofar as these claims refer back to claims 1-3, is novel.

6. Inventive Step

6.1 The objection of the former opponent against granted claim 1 was based on D1 as the closest prior art.

As mentioned above, the method of D1 proceeds through two basic transesterification stages, between which a significant amount of lower alcohol, namely methanol, is distilled off. Only after the distillation of methanol is a separation of glycerin carried out.

6.2 In light of the fact that granted claim 1 does not include the above addition (see point 2) and thus does not per se exclude the removal of methanol by distillation, the former opponent argued that the novelty of granted claim 1 over D1 could only be acknowledged if the interpretation of the claim advocated by the appellant were correct. According to this interpretation, further process steps between the first basic transesterification stage and the separation of the glycerin phase, such as the distillation of methanol described in D1, are excluded. However, assuming the correctness of this interpretation, a method would still fall within the subject matter of granted claim 1 in which glycerin phase is first separated and only then methanol is distilled off. Such a method would differ from that of D1 only in that the steps of separating the glycerin phase and distilling off methanol are reversed. A mere reversal of process steps cannot establish inventive step. Claim 1 thus does not encompass inventive embodiments.

6.3 As explained above, the removal of methanol in the method of claim 1 of the main request is excluded. Therefore, the embodiments considered non-inventive by the former opponent (directed to a separation of glycerin phase followed by a distillation of methanol) are no longer encompassed by claim 1 of the main request. The objection raised against granted claim 1 can therefore no longer apply to claim 1 of the main request.

6.4 Thus, the subject matter of claim 1 and the dependent claims 2, 3, and 6 to 16, insofar as these claims refer back to claims 1-3, also involves an inventive step. The main request is allowable.

7. The Board has verified that the description submitted with the letter dated July 7, 2022, has been adapted to the claims of the main request and meets the requirements of the EPC.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2.

I. The appellant (patent holder) has filed an appeal against the revocation of European Patent 2 394 617 by the decision of the opposition division.

The appellant requested the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the contested patent in the granted version (main request), alternatively the maintenance of the contested patent in amended form based on the claims of auxiliary requests 1 to 3, submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal. Additionally, a refund of the appeal fee was requested.

II. The respondent (opponent) requested that the appeal be dismissed as inadmissible, alternatively to reject the appeal. Furthermore, it requested that auxiliary requests 2 and 3 not be admitted into the proceedings and that the appellant be ordered to bear the costs incurred by the respondent in the course of the appeal proceedings.

III. The parties were summoned to an oral hearing. In a communication to prepare for the hearing, the parties were informed of the preliminary opinion of the board. The board stated inter alia that

- the appeal is admissible,

- it sees no reason for a cost distribution in favor of the opponent,

- it does not recognize any procedural error by the opposition division and sees no reason for a refund of the appeal fee,

- the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request and auxiliary request 1 does not appear to be novel,

- it intends not to admit auxiliary requests 2 and 3 into the proceedings.

IV. Subsequently, the appellant announced in a letter dated March 10, 2022, that it would not participate in the oral hearing and withdrew its request for an oral hearing.

V. In a letter dated March 28, 2022, the respondent withdrew the requests to

dismiss the appeal as inadmissible, and

order the appellant to bear the costs incurred in the course of the appeal proceedings.

VI. The oral hearing was then canceled, and the decision could be made in writing.

VII. The following document is relevant to the present decision:

D3 US 2010/0049326 Al

VIII. The wording of the main request is as follows:

""1. Layered biomatrix (1) made of a carrier material, comprising proteins formed from regularly geometrically shaped, uniformly arranged pieces (2), which are separably connected to each other by continuous, through-going perforations (3) extending over the surface of the layered biomatrix, and which can be varied in size, shape, and/or design by separating one or more segments of variable size and shape, formed from at least one of the regularly shaped pieces (2), along the perforations (3).""

IX. The wording of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 differs from the wording of the main request in that the carrier material comprises collagen (instead of proteins in general).

X. The wording of claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 differs from the wording of auxiliary request 1 in that the carrier material ""predominantly"" comprises collagen.

XI. The wording of claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 is as follows:

""Layered biomatrix (1) made of a carrier material, predominantly comprising collagen, formed from regularly geometrically shaped, uniformly arranged pieces (2), which are separably connected to each other by continuous, through-going perforations (3) extending over the surface from one point of the outer edge of the biomatrix to another point of the outer edge of the layered biomatrix opposite to it, and which can be varied in size, shape, and/or design by separating one or more segments of variable size and shape, formed from at least one of the regularly shaped pieces (2), along the perforations (3).""

XII. The arguments of the appellant can be summarized as follows:

Refund of the appeal fee

The appeal fee should be refunded in full.

The preliminary opinion of the opposition division was legally arbitrary as it did not conduct any substantive examination.

The opposition division changed its opinion regarding the relevance of D3 between the ""first"" proceedings, which ended with the annulment of the decision (T 807/17), and the subsequent ""second"" part of the opposition proceedings, without justification. In the ""first"" proceedings, it had held that D3 did not clearly disclose all features of claim 1. In the ""second"" proceedings, however, it considered D3 to be detrimental to novelty in its preliminary opinion, without indicating where the individual features are disclosed in D3. This does not constitute a substantive examination. First, the opposition division should have examined whether the objection based on D3 was to be considered late. Furthermore, it did not take the arguments of the patent holder into account in any way. This approach is to be regarded as arbitrary and violated the legal hearing rights of the appellant and the principle of legal certainty.

The decision of the opposition division does not meet the reasoning requirements of Rule 111 EPC.

Given the arbitrary and contradictory conduct of the opposition division, the appellant did not present any further arguments in response to its preliminary opinion or participate in the oral hearing.

Main request - Novelty

The subject matter of claim 1 is novel. The prior art D3 does not disclose an organic biomatrix.

The pieces in Figure 3 of D3 are not uniformly arranged, and the perforations disclosed in D3 are not continuous and end before the center.

Auxiliary request 1 - Novelty

The subject matter of claim 1 is novel. Collagen has not been used in the biomatrix. Collagen is only mentioned as an additive in paragraph [0072] of D3 and thus does not constitute the support material.

XIII. The arguments of the respondent can be summarized as follows:

Refund of the appeal fee

A violation of the appellant's right to be heard cannot occur through the preliminary opinion of the opposition division, see Rule 116 EPC (""With the summons, the European Patent Office points out the questions it considers to be deserving of discussion for the decision to be made""). Regarding the consideration of D3 by the opposition division, it should be noted that corresponding objections based on D3 regarding lack of novelty or lack of inventive step had already been raised in the notice of opposition.

Main request - Novelty

D3 discloses in paragraph [0072] that collagen, a protein, can be added to the carrier material, thereby disclosing the feature ""carrier material comprising proteins.""

The subject matter of claim 1 is therefore not novel.

Auxiliary request 1 - Novelty

D3 discloses in paragraph [0072] that collagen can be added to the carrier material. Thus, the added feature ""collagen"" is also known from D3.

The subject matter of claim 1 is therefore not novel.

Admissibility of auxiliary requests 2 and 3

It is not apparent, nor has it been argued, why these requests were not submitted in the first instance or for what reasons these requests are only being made at this time.

The admission of auxiliary requests 2 and 3 would disadvantage the opponent, as it would deprive them of the opportunity for a first-instance decision. The fact that the appellant did not submit these requests in the first instance and also did not participate in the oral hearing are procedural decisions that should not be to the detriment of the opponent.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Procedural Errors and Refund of the Appeal Fee

1.1 According to the appellant, the opposition division acted arbitrarily by considering document D3 for the first time in its communication preparing for the oral proceedings as detrimental to novelty, after a decision of the opposition division had already been overturned in a previous appeal procedure, although it had previously held a different view. Furthermore, it did not take into account the arguments of the patent proprietor nor conducted a substantive examination, thereby violating the appellant's right to be heard and failing to meet the requirements for reasoning under Rule 111 EPC.

1.2 This assertion is not convincing for the following reasons. Firstly, it should be noted that the opposition division is not bound by an opinion it expressed in a previous communication. In opposition proceedings, arguments from the parties are typically further developed in correspondence with respect to the provisional views of the opposition division. This can naturally lead to prior art, such as in the provisional case of D3, being subject to different technical assessments. The fact that the novelty objection based on D3 was subject to reevaluation does not in itself indicate arbitrary conduct by the opposition division. Moreover, a reevaluation of this objection by the opposition division would have been possible even after a discussion during the oral proceedings. A binding effect of the opposition division's provisional opinion would render an oral hearing unnecessary. Such an understanding of the opposition procedure does not align with the concept of a bilateral procedure. It should also be noted in relation to the appellant's assertion that a corresponding objection was already included in the notice of opposition, so no admissibility examination needed to be conducted.

1.3 Regarding the objection that the opposition division did not conduct a substantive examination concerning the novelty objection based on D3, the board notes the following: In the opposition proceedings, it was merely disputed that collagens in D3 are an additive, while the biomatrix defined in claim 1 consists of proteins. Furthermore, it was questioned whether the ""wedges"" disclosed in D3 correspond to the ""regularly geometrically shaped, uniformly arranged segments that are separably connected by continuous perforations extending across the surface of the layered biomatrix"" defined in claim 1 (see page 2 of the letter dated June 28, 2019).

The discussion did not concern any further features of claim 1, and thus the provisional opinion of the opposition division did not need to address any additional features of the claim. These features were also addressed in the provisional opinion of the opposition division (see point 8.1.1.2 of the summons dated July 18, 2019).

If the opposition division has no concerns regarding other features and there are no differing arguments from the parties, there is no reason for further elaboration. Therefore, there is neither a lack of substantive examination nor a deficiency in reasoning. In response to the communication from the opposition division, in which it set out its provisional view, no further substantive comments were made; rather, the appellant withdrew their request for an oral hearing in a letter dated August 8, 2019, and requested a written decision. Since the appellant apparently disagreed with the provisional view of the opposition division, it would have been their responsibility to present their position in writing or during the oral proceedings. As there were no further substantive comments, the opposition division could rely on and confirm its provisional view in its reasoning for the decision. Thus, there is neither a deficiency in reasoning nor can arbitrary conduct by the opposition division be seen. Since the opposition division sufficiently considered the appellant's submissions when drafting the decision, the board believes that there is also no violation of the right to be heard.

1.4 Regarding the cited decision T 278/00, it should be noted that it concerned an inadequate reasoning. However, as stated above, the opposition division sufficiently reasoned both its provisional view and its decision. The cited decision is therefore not relevant. For completeness, the board points out that the arguments of the patent proprietor are reproduced in point 2.1.2 of the reasons for the decision and addressed in point 2.1.3 of the decision.

1.5 Since there is no procedural error at first instance, the conditions for a refund of the appeal fee under Rule 103(1)(a) EPC are not met.

2. Main Request - Novelty

2.1.1 D3 discloses all features of claim 1.

2.1.2 The appellant argued that the prior art D3 does not disclose an organic biomatrix. A biomatrix is a 100% natural, laboratory-tested, industrial absorbent that is non-toxic and non-leaching and is biologically degradable in its natural state. The inherent capillary action creates a strong wicking effect.

Furthermore, D3 uses bone material, the majority of which consists of inorganic substances. The salts calcium fluoride, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, calcium chloride, and magnesium phosphate provide stability and strength to the bone. In summary, the scaffold in D3 consists of inorganic material. The protein in D3 may be ""between this"" supporting material. The scaffold (biomatrix) in claim 1, however, consists of proteins.

2.1.3 These arguments do not convince the board. Claim 1 does not define an absorbent nor a capillary action.

Paragraph [0053] (see last sentence) of D3 states, ""The bone particles may be obtained from cortical, cancellous and/or corticocancellous bone which may be of autogenous, allogenic, transgenic, and/or xenogenic origin,"" meaning that the bone particles have a biological origin. The implant in D3 is therefore to be regarded as a biomatrix.

Even if this were not the case, the addition of materials of ""biological origin"" (see paragraph [0063]) as well as ""collagen sponges"" supports the existence of an organic matrix. Thus, D3 discloses a biomatrix.

It is noted at this point that paragraph [0038] of the contested patent defines a biomatrix as a layer formed from a ""substantially biocompatible"" carrier material. The layer does not necessarily have to be made exclusively from materials of biological origin.

2.2 The appellant also argued that the segments in D3 are not uniformly arranged. However, the board finds that the segments 38 in D3, Figure 3, are of equal size and evenly distributed in a radial direction, and thus are uniformly arranged.

2.3 The appellant further argued that the perforations disclosed in D3 are not continuous and end before the center. Thus, D3 does not disclose that a separation occurs along the perforations. D3 also does not disclose that size and shape are variable.

In the board's opinion, the skilled person clearly derives from the non-continuous contour line of the brittle segment 39 that these correspond to tear lines. Furthermore, paragraph [0044] of D3 describes how the segments 38 can be removed if a smaller cone is desired, for which continuous perforations are needed. Ultimately, the brittle ring-shaped segment 39 must be broken to reduce the radius of the cone. Thus, D3 also discloses that the size and shape of the cone are variable.

2.4 The subject matter of claim 1 therefore does not meet the novelty requirement under Article 54 (1) and (2) EPC. The main request is therefore not allowable.

3. Auxiliary Request 1 - Novelty

3.1 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 differs from that of the main request in that the carrier material comprises collagen (instead of proteins in general).

3.2 The appellant argued that collagen is not used in the biomatrix. Collagen is only mentioned as an additive in paragraph [0072] of D3 and thus does not constitute the supporting material.

The board does not agree with this view. In paragraph [0072] of D3, it is provided that collagen can be added to the carrier material. However, such a combination of bone material with collagen is not excluded by the wording of claim 1. If collagen is added to the bone material that corresponds to the carrier material defined in claim 1, then a combination of both is created. This combination forms a carrier material that includes collagen, as defined in claim 1.

3.3 D3 thus discloses the added feature. Since all features of claim 1 are known from D3, the novelty requirement under Article 54 (1) and (2) EPC is not fulfilled. The auxiliary request 1 of the appellant is therefore not allowable.

4. Admission of Auxiliary Requests 2 and 3

4.1 According to Article 12 (2) RPBA 2020, the primary objective of the appeal procedure is to review the contested decision. The appeal submissions should therefore be directed to those requests that underlie the contested decision. Under Article 12 (6) sentence 2 RPBA 2020, the board does not admit requests, facts, objections, or evidence that should have been presented in the proceedings leading to the contested decision, unless the circumstances of the appeal case justify their admission.

4.2 With their statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant submitted new auxiliary requests 2 and 3, which have no counterpart in the opposition proceedings.

4.3 In assessing whether corresponding requests should have been made in the context of the opposition proceedings, it should be considered that the appellant did not provide any further substantive arguments in response to the provisional opinion of the opposition division; rather, they withdrew their request for an oral hearing and requested a prompt written decision.

4.4 As the board already indicated in point 5.2 of its provisional opinion, the appellant thus made the decision to waive the opportunity to further exercise their right to be heard in the first-instance proceedings. In this regard, the patent proprietor argued that it was unreasonable for them to make further efforts given the arbitrary conduct of the opposition division. The board has set out its contrary view in point 1 above. Furthermore, it should be noted that an appeal procedure does not simply provide an alternative route for the negotiation and decision of an opposition, and the parties are not free to shift their case to the second instance, thereby forcing the board either to make a first judgment on the critical issues or to remit the matter back to the opposition division. Granting the appellant this freedom would be contrary to a proper and efficient procedure. It was therefore the responsibility of the appellant to submit corresponding requests in response to the provisional opinion of the opposition division, i.e., in the first-instance proceedings.

4.5 The board has therefore exercised its discretion under Article 12 (6) sentence 2 RPBA 2020 not to admit auxiliary requests 2 and 3 into the appeal proceedings.

5. Since there is no request in the proceedings that meets the requirements of the EPC or on the basis of which the patent could be maintained, the appeal is unsuccessful and must be dismissed.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,Paul Hartmann AG,Paul Hartmann AG Paul-Hartmann-Strasse 12 89522 Heidenheim / DE,DREISS Patentanwälte PartG mbB Postfach 10 37 62 70032 Stuttgart / DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. European Patent No. 1 622 587 (hereinafter: the Patent) was granted with fifteen claims. These related to a solid pharmaceutical preparation containing water-soluble salts of levothyroxine and/or liothyronine as active ingredients, whose water activity measured at room temperature is set to values below 0.4 and above 0.1.

II. Two opposers filed oppositions against the grant of the patent. The grounds for opposition included lack of novelty and lack of inventive step, insufficient disclosure, and impermissible extension.

In appeal proceedings T 793/13, the decision of the opposition division dated November 26, 2012, to revoke the patent due to insufficient disclosure was overturned, and the matter was remitted for further decision based on auxiliary request 1 dated June 14, 2013.

III. The appeal of the patent proprietor is directed against the further decision of the opposition division announced on October 21, 2019, to revoke the patent. The decision concerned auxiliary requests 1-5, which were submitted with the letter dated June 14, 2013.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 read:

""Solid pharmaceutical preparation containing water-soluble salts of levothyroxine and/or liothyronine as active ingredient and excipients, characterized in that the water activity of the pharmaceutical preparation measured at room temperature is set to values of 0.1 to 0.3.""

Auxiliary request 2 contained the following independent method claim 7:

""Method for producing a pharmaceutical preparation according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that a carrier of mannitol is coated or sprayed with an alcoholic solution of the active ingredient, whereupon the alcoholic solvent is evaporated until a water factor of below 0.3 and above 0.1 is achieved and is subsequently tableted.""

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 corresponded to claim 1 of auxiliary request 1, with the additional definition that the values of water activity are measured at room temperature of 25°C.

Auxiliary request 4 contained the same independent method claim 7 as auxiliary request 2.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 5 corresponded to claim 1 of auxiliary request 1, with the following feature added:

""and characterized in that the preparation is in the form of tablets and is packaged in a container with low or no water vapor permeability.""

V. The opposition division reached the following conclusions:

a) The subject matter of auxiliary request 1 was novel over documents D1, D2, D5, O8, O9, O11, O14, and O15, in which water activity was not mentioned.

The prior uses of the marketed products ""Euthyrox 100"" and ""L-Thyrox 100"" did not anticipate the novelty of the subject matter of the claim, as a corresponding water activity had not been convincingly demonstrated for these products.

b) Documents D5 and O11 were both suitable as the closest prior art.

The subject matter of auxiliary request 1 differed from the levothyroxine compositions of D5 and O11 by the definition of water activity. The problem to be solved was to provide further levothyroxine compositions.

The claimed solution by setting the water activity to values of 0.1 to 0.3 was obvious to the skilled person. Document D5 already described minimizing water content to ensure the stability of the compositions. The skilled person therefore had reason to minimize the influence of water and thus also of water activity accordingly.

c) Auxiliary requests 2 and 4 contained method claims that, according to the decision in appeal proceedings T 793/13, could not be admitted.

Auxiliary request 3 was not admitted.

d) The additional definition of packaging with low water vapor permeability according to claim 1 of auxiliary request 5 did not involve an inventive step, as such packaging for tablets was evident from document D5 and general expert knowledge.

VI. With the statement of grounds of appeal dated June 29, 2020, the appellant maintained its requests from the opposition proceedings, with the former auxiliary request 5 being advanced as auxiliary request 2. Furthermore, it requested the acceleration of the appeal proceedings.

VII. With the summons dated December 16, 2020, the Board invited the parties to an oral hearing.

In its communication pursuant to Article 15 (1) RPBA 2020 dated February 3, 2021, the Board agreed to the acceleration of the appeal proceedings according to Article 10 (3) RPBA 2020. The present requests of the appellant were designated as main request and auxiliary requests 1-4. The Board shared, among other things, its preliminary assessment that the appellant's argument regarding a particular advantage of the claimed range for water activity seems to rely on verifiable experimental data, which the respondents merely questioned without experimental verification.

VIII. Opponent 1 submitted the following evidence with its submission dated September 30, 2021:

El-O9: Test report ""Stability Study with Tablets containing Levothyroxine""

Opponent 2 submitted the following evidence with its submission dated October 27, 2021:

O22: Test report Dr. Björn Buchholz dated October 25, 2021

O23: Test report Tanja Führmann dated October 22, 2021

and with its submission dated November 26, 2021 the following evidence:

O24: Test report Tanja Führmann dated November 24, 2021.

IX. The oral hearing was held on November 30, 2021, as a video conference.

X. The relevant arguments of the appellant for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) Objections of lack of novelty regarding the granulate described in example 1 of document D2 or in relation to document D2 in light of document E1-08 should not be admitted according to Article 13 (2) RPBA 2020, as this argument was first presented during the oral hearing in the appeal proceedings by the respondents.

b) Document D2 relates to the provision of stable levothyroxine preparations, but this document does not describe the water activity of the pharmaceutical preparations defined in claim 1 of the main request. The respondents have not provided the necessary evidence that this feature is implicitly derived from example 1 of document D2. As explained in decision T 793/93, a strict standard applies for the proof of implicit disclosure according to the established case law of the Boards of Appeal. The alleged reworking of example 1 of document D2 according to document D4 is, however, questionable and thus unsuitable as evidence. Information on the water activity of the 100 myg tablets produced according to example 1 of document D2 is missing in document D4. Furthermore, regarding documents E1-01, E1-02, and E1-07, it is questionable whether the batches of Euthyrox 100 granulate or Euthyrox 25 and 200 tablets examined according to document D4 were produced according to the specifications of example 1 of document D2. It should be noted that document D2 does not provide any reason to ensure a low water activity of the tablets to be produced after obtaining the granulate, and according to document E1-07, the water activity is not given special consideration even in the production of Euthyrox 100 tablets. In contrast, document P-D2 shows that Euthyrox 100 tablets produced and blister-packed only in April 2011 exhibited a water activity of 0.47 when examined in August 2011. The low water activities of Euthyrox granulates and tablets produced therefrom reported in document E1-08 are not convincing in this context.

c) The test reports E1-09 and O22 to O24 submitted shortly before the oral hearing should not be admitted in the appeal proceedings. No compelling reasons have been shown that extraordinary circumstances exist.

d) Document D2 does not describe the provision of tablets whose water activity is set to values of 0.1 to 0.3 in a packaging with low or no water vapor permeability. Document D2 does not imply any impairment of stability due to the water activity of the preparation. Although documents D5 and O11 mention a moisture sensitivity of levothyroxine-containing preparations, these documents explain that drying has no significant impact on the stability of the preparations and that stability rather depends on the choice of excipients. Document O8 even warns against overdrying below the water content of the stable pentahydrate of levothyroxine. Furthermore, document O11 indicates that this pentahydrate loses up to 2 moles of water precisely in the range of relative humidity from 30 to 10%. The special stability of levothyroxine-containing preparations with a water activity of 0.1 to 0.3 as indicated in the patent and in document P-D13 is, in contrast, surprising for the skilled person. The water vapor protective packaging ensures this stability. The claimed subject matter was therefore not obvious to the skilled person as a solution to the problem of providing an alternative levothyroxine-containing preparation, let alone as a solution to the problem of providing a particularly stable levothyroxine-containing preparation.

e) The feature defined in claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 regarding the setting of water activity at room temperature of 25°C measured to values of 0.1 to 0.3 is not derivable from document D2.

XI. The relevant arguments of the respondents can be summarized as follows:

a) The objections of lack of novelty based on the granulate described in example 1 of document D2 and based on document D2 in connection with document E1-08 were already raised in the response to the appeal of respondent-opponent 1 and date back to their submission of April 18, 2012, in the opposition proceedings. In contrast, the appellant presented its arguments regarding novelty entirely for the first time during the hearing.

b) Document D2 describes in example 1 the provision of levothyroxine-containing granulates and tablets that correspond to the pharmaceutical preparations according to claim 1 of the main request. The relevant water activity of the preparations known from document D2 is derived from document D4, which shows corresponding values for the water activity of Euthyrox 100 granulates as well as Euthyrox 25 and 200 tablets. Furthermore, document E1-08 also suggests the corresponding water activity of the preparations produced according to document D2.

c) The submission of the test reports E1-09 and O22 to O24 was prompted by the Board's communication of February 3, 2021, as this communication provided the first reason for the submission of further experimental trials.

d) Based on the tablets produced according to document D2 in example 1, it would have been obvious for the skilled person to place these tablets in a packaging with low or no water vapor permeability. This is a common protective measure in the provision of tablets according to document D21. Packaging immediately after the production of the tablets was indicated for the skilled person precisely because of the moisture sensitivity of levothyroxine-containing preparations known from documents D5 and D11.

e) Auxiliary requests 2 and 4, which contain both product claims and method claims, were rightly rejected as inadmissible.

The additional definition of the exact temperature of 25°C in claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 does not represent a difference compared to the preparations described in example 1 of document D2.

XII. The appellant requested that the contested decision be overturned and that the patent be maintained on the basis of auxiliary request 1 dated June 14, 2013, which was presented as the main request in the appeal proceedings.

In the alternative, the appellant requested the maintenance of the patent on the basis of one of auxiliary requests 5 or 2-4 dated June 14, 2013, which were presented as auxiliary requests 1-4 in the appeal proceedings.

The appellant requested that the test reports E1-09 and O22 to O24 submitted by the respondents not be admitted into the appeal proceedings.

XIII. The respondents requested the dismissal of the appeal.

Respondent-opponent 1 further requested the admission of test report E1-09.

Respondent-opponent 2 further requested the admission of test reports O22 to O24.","Reasons for the Decision

Admission of Documents E1-09 and O22 to O24

1. Documents E1-09 and O22 to O24 were submitted by the respondents after the summons to the oral proceedings on December 16, 2020. These documents are experimental reports intended to demonstrate that the claimed range for the values of water activity is not associated with a particular stability.

2. The Board sees no convincing reasons that extraordinary circumstances exist which would justify the consideration of these documents. The justification put forward by the respondents that the late submission of the experimental reports E1-09 and O22 to O24 was due to the communication from the Board dated February 3, 2021, is not persuasive. In this communication, the Board merely pointed out, in accordance with Article 15(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA), points present in the appeal proceedings that seemed particularly relevant for the decision to be made and provided its preliminary assessment. Therefore, the Board does not admit documents E1-09 and O22 to O24 into the appeal proceedings in accordance with Article 13(2) RPBA.

Main Request (submitted as Auxiliary Request 1 on June 14, 2013)

3. Novelty

3.1 Claim 1 of the main request relates to a solid pharmaceutical preparation containing water-soluble salts of levothyroxine and/or liothyronine as active ingredients, and whose water activity, measured at room temperature, is set to values of 0.1 to 0.3 (see Section III above).

Thus, in the Board's view, the definition according to claim 1 of the main request also encompasses such solid pharmaceutical preparations that are in the form of granules.

3.2 Document D2 describes in Example 1 (see pages 5-6) the provision of granules containing sodium levothyroxine and tablets made therefrom. According to the example, a suspension of sodium levothyroxine and a gelatin solution is prepared at 45 to 50°C. This suspension is sprayed as a granulating liquid in a fluidized bed granulator with a spray pressure between 3 and 5 bar and a temperature between 40 and 50°C onto a powder consisting of corn starch and lactose, while the temperature at the inlet is maintained at approximately 70°C and at the outlet between 20-40°C. The granulate is dried after spraying until an outlet temperature of approximately 40°C is reached. Subsequently, the granulate is sieved, mixed with sieved croscarmellose sodium and magnesium stearate for 10 minutes, and then compressed into tablets.

In the Board's view, both the granules and the tablets of Example 1 of Document D2 are solid pharmaceutical preparations containing levothyroxine salts. However, Document D2 does not explicitly describe the claimed values of water activity of the produced granules and tablets. For the question of novelty of the claimed subject matter, it is therefore crucial whether the claimed values of water activity, although not explicitly stated, can be clearly and directly derived from the manufacturing process of the preparations described in Document D2.

3.3 Document D4 reports for the water activity measured at 25°C of batches of Euthyrox 100 granules produced in January 2010 values between 0.149 and 0.181, and for batches of Euthyrox 25 and 200 tablets values of 0.215 and 0.219 (see D4, page 2, Section 2).

According to Document D4 (see page 1, Section 1 and page 3, Section 5), the examined granules and tablets were produced according to the method of Example 1 of Document D2. In this context, Document D4 lists process steps A to E (see page 1, Section 1) that correspond to the method of Example 1 of Document D2. The description of the manufacturing process for Euthyrox tablets, as reported in Document D4, is consistent with the manufacturing process described in Document E1-03, which, according to Document E1-02, is used for the production of Euthyrox 100 mcg tablets.

Document E1-08 also describes values of water activity of Euthyrox granules and the 100 mcg tablets made therefrom (see E1-08, pages 2-3, Table 1). According to Document E1-08, the examined granules and tablets were produced according to the method described in Document E1-03, with the final drying temperature for the granules produced according to Document E1-08 being 38°C (see E1-08, page 1, Section 1). The reported values of water activity of the relevant Euthyrox granules and tablets in Document D4 range from 0.17 to 0.21, thus aligning with the values mentioned in Document E1-08, which range from 0.17 to 0.19.

3.4 Document D3 indicates that when using a fluidized bed granulator, as described for the method of Example 1 of Document D2, the drying temperature at the outlet is crucial for the relative humidity of the exhaust air and thus also for the water activity of the dried granulate (see D3, pages 291-292, especially Figure 4/24). As described above in Section 3.3, Documents D4 and E1-08 show that granules produced similarly to those in Example 1 of Document D2, and particularly dried to similar temperatures at the outlet of the fluidized bed granulator, exhibit water activity values that fall within the claimed range of 0.1 to 0.3.

Furthermore, Documents D4 and E1-08 demonstrate that subsequent processing after obtaining the dried granulate, where the granulate is sieved as in Example 1 of Document D2, mixed with sieved croscarmellose sodium and magnesium stearate for 10 minutes, and then compressed into tablets, results in tablets with water activity values within the range of 0.1 to 0.3.

Thus, in the Board's view, Documents D4 and E1-08 provide convincing evidence that the method of Example 1 from Document D2 clearly and directly leads to granules and tablets that exhibit water activity values within the claimed range.

3.5 The objections regarding lack of novelty based on the granulate described in Example 1 of Document D2 and based on Document D2 in conjunction with Document E1-08 were already raised in the response to the appeal by Respondent 1. Furthermore, this argument traces back to the submission of Respondent 1 dated April 18, 2012, in the opposition proceedings. Therefore, this argument is part of the appeal proceedings in accordance with Articles 12(1) to 12(3) RPBA 2020.

3.6 According to the established case law of the Boards of Appeal, a document of the prior art anticipates a claimed subject matter if it can be derived directly and unambiguously from the document, including features that are implicitly encompassed by the content for the skilled person (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 9th edition 2019, I.C.4.3). In this regard, the appellant has also argued that a strict standard should be applied for proving an alleged implicit disclosure, as explicitly confirmed in the case of T 793/93.

In the present case, however, the Board sees no legitimate doubts that the claimed values of water activity of the preparations necessarily arise from the method of Example 1 from Document D2. The arguments put forward by the appellant in this regard are not convincing for the following reasons.

3.6.1 Document D4 does not contain any information on the water activity of 100 mcg tablets produced according to Example 1 of Document D2.

However, Document D4 reports corresponding values of water activity for Euthyrox 100 granules and Euthyrox 25 and 200 tablets. Moreover, Document E1-08 provides corresponding values for similarly produced granules and 100 mcg levothyroxine tablets. There is therefore no doubt that 100 mcg tablets would exhibit the same ranges of values as the 25 mcg and 200 mcg tablets produced using the same preparation method.

3.6.2 According to Document D4, the described manufacturing process for the examined preparations has been used unchanged for the production of Euthyrox preparations since 1999. In contrast, as the appellant pointed out, Document E1-02 dated July 7, 2000, contains amendments regarding the production of Euthyrox 100 mcg tablets approved on March 1, 2000, according to Document E1-01.

However, the changes indicated in Document E1-02 only concern the switch to plant-derived magnesium stearate and in-process control specifications. These changes do not deviate from the description of the production of the granules and tablets in Document D4 and therefore cannot call into question the information in Document D4.

3.6.3 Document E1-07, the manufacturing protocol for Euthyrox 100 tablets of batch 26618 dated December 5, 2001, does not, in the Board's view, cast doubt on the information in Document D4.

Although Document E1-07 mentions a target value or target range of 32 (25-40)°C for the drying temperature (see E1-07, page 13) and points out the lack of determination of the water value contrary to the manufacturing instructions (see E1-07, page 31), Document E1-07 shows an actual drying temperature of 39°C and does not indicate any deviation from the description of the preparation of the formulations in Document D4.

3.6.4 Document D2 does not mention any particular sensitivity of levothyroxine to moisture, and the manufacturing protocol of Document E1-07 does not contain any instruction to ensure a low water activity of the Euthyrox tablets to be produced.

The description of the manufacturing process in Documents D4 and E1-08 also does not require any special measures in this regard, except that the granulate is subsequently processed into tablets after drying, just as described for the method of Example 1 in Document D2. In the Board's view, Documents D4 and E1-08 thus confirm that the tablet production according to Example 1 of Document D2 leads to preparations with corresponding values of water activity without special precautions. The mere possibility that the tablet production according to Document D2 could still be carried out under special humidity conditions leading to differing values appears to the Board to be far-fetched without corresponding evidence and thus does not raise legitimate doubts about the information in Documents D4 and E1-08.

3.6.5 According to Document P-D2, Euthyrox 100 tablets of batch 132469, produced in April 2011 and blister-packed, exhibited a water activity of 0.47 in August 2011.

However, these are tablets that were examined 4 months after production. The indicated values of water activity cannot therefore necessarily be extrapolated to values of freshly produced tablets according to Example 1 from Document D2. Furthermore, according to Document E1-08 dated April 16, 2012, tablets of the same batch stored in glass containers show water activity values that, while exceeding those of the newly produced tablets examined, are significantly lower than the values of Document P-D2. Thus, the results from Document P-D2 also do not call into question the information in Documents D4 and E1-08.

3.7 For the above reasons, the Board concludes that claim 1 of the main request does not meet the requirement of novelty.

Auxiliary Request 1 (submitted as Auxiliary Request 5 on June 14, 2013)

4. Inventive Step

4.1 Claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 1 additionally defines that the preparation is in the form of tablets and is packaged in a container with low or no water vapor permeability compared to claim 1 of the main request.

The defined packaging distinguishes the claimed subject matter from Example 1 of Document D2, which does not mention any corresponding packaging of the described tablets.

4.2 The appellant can be agreed with that the packaging is intended to contribute to maintaining the water activity set to values of 0.1 to 0.3 and thus to the stability of the tablets.

The objective problem with respect to Document D2 as the closest prior art is thus seen in ensuring the stability of the tablets of Example 1 of Document D2.

4.3 In this context, the Board notes that Document D2 does not describe any special measures against the influence of ambient humidity after the drying of the granulate and the subsequent pressing of the tablets. As indicated in Document O21 (page 596, left column), a packaging that is as water- and water vapor-tight as possible is a common protective measure for tablets. This measure was particularly indicated for levothyroxine tablets, such as those of Example 1 of Document D2, because according to Documents D5 and O11, levothyroxine is moisture-sensitive in pharmaceutical preparations (see D5, page 1, lines 17-20; see O11, page 95, lines 11-14 and page 137, lines 16-17). The subject matter of claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 1 was therefore obvious to the skilled person as a solution to the problem of ensuring the stability of tablets produced according to Example 1 of Document D2.

4.4 The appellant's argument that Documents D5 and O11 do not lead the skilled person to the claimed subject matter because, according to these documents, the drying of levothyroxine-containing preparations does not have a significant impact on the stability of the preparations is not convincing. The appellant refers to studies reported in Documents D5 and O11 on the storage stability of levothyroxine-containing preparations. According to Documents D5 and O11, the storage stability is not significantly influenced by the presence of drying agents (see D5, page 17 and pages 18-20, Tables 2-4; see O11, page 95, lines 18-22). However, storage in the presence of drying agents to investigate the stability of the tablets, partly even at 75% relative humidity, does not, in the Board's view, represent a drying process.

4.5 Document O8 warns against overdrying below the water content of the stable pentahydrate of levothyroxine (see O8, page 9, lines 13-16 and page 10, lines 23-26). Document O11 also points out that levothyroxine loses up to 2 moles of water in the relative humidity range of 30 to 10% (see O11, page 89, lines 10-12). Thus, in the Board's view, Documents O8 and O11 highlight the importance of a packaging that is as water vapor-tight as possible for tablets produced according to Example 1 of Document D2.

4.6 As explained above in Sections 3.1 to 3.7, tablets produced according to Example 1 of Document D2 exhibit water activity corresponding to the claimed values. Starting from Document D2 as the closest prior art, the particular stability of the claimed preparation, which the appellant claims is associated with the claimed values of water activity, therefore does not contribute to an inventive step, in the Board's view.

4.7 For the above reasons, the Board concludes that claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 1 does not meet the requirement of inventive step.

Auxiliary Requests 2 and 4 (submitted as Auxiliary Requests 2 and 4 on June 14, 2013)

5. Process Claim 7 of both Auxiliary Requests 2 and 4 is identical to Process Claim 7 of the main request of the appellant in the previous appeal proceedings T 793/13. In that case, the Board decided not to admit the main request due to this process claim (see Reasons for the Decision, Sections 1.1 to 1.12).

The opposition division rightly did not admit Auxiliary Requests 2 and 4 into the opposition proceedings in accordance with Article 111(2) EPC after the referral of the matter for further decision.

Auxiliary Request 3 (submitted as Auxiliary Request 3 on June 14, 2013)

6. Claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 3 merely additionally defines that the values of water activity are values measured at room temperature of 25°C compared to claim 1 of the main request.

As explained above in Section 3.3, the Board is of the opinion that the preparation of claim 1 of the main request is not novel, as Documents D4 and E1-08 indicate that solid pharmaceutical preparations with corresponding values of water activity already arise from the previously described production of levothyroxine-containing granules and tablets in Example 1 of Document D2. According to Documents D4 and E1-08, these values of water activity were measured at 25°C (see D4, page 2, Section 2; see E1-08, page 2, Section 2.3). Accordingly, the Board concludes that the subject matter of claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 3 also does not meet the requirement of novelty.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,"Merck Patent GmbH, Hexal AG",Merck Patent GmbH Frankfurter Strasse 250 64293 Darmstadt / DE,"Féaux de Lacroix, Stefan Patentanwälte Isenbruck Bösl Hörschler PartG mbB Eastsite One Seckenheimer Landstrasse 4 68163 Mannheim / DE",Hexal AG Industriestrasse 25 83607 Holzkirchen / DE,"Hoffmann Eitle, et al, et al Patent- und Rechtsanwälte PartmbB Arabellastraße 30 81925 München / DE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. European Patent No. EP 2 403 947 (hereinafter ""the Patent"") is based on European Patent Application No. 09 808 976.6, which was filed as international patent application PCT/DE2009/001623 (hereinafter ""the application as originally filed"").

II. An opposition was filed against the grant of the Patent, requesting revocation in its entirety. The ground for opposition included, among others, impermissible extension (Article 100(c) EPC).

III. The Opposition Division decided, among other things, that the claims of Auxiliary Request 1 were impermissibly extended (Article 123(2) EPC), but that the Patent in the form of Auxiliary Request 2 and the invention it relates to meet the requirements of the EPC.

IV. Both the Patent Proprietor and the Opponent filed an appeal against this interim decision of the Opposition Division.

V. With the statement of grounds of appeal, the Patent Proprietor submitted claim sets of a main request and fourteen auxiliary requests, with the claim sets of the main request and Auxiliary Request 1 being identical to those of the underlying Auxiliary Requests 1 and 2 of the contested decision.

VI. In the statement of grounds of appeal, the Opponent raised objections under Article 123(2) EPC against the claims of the underlying Auxiliary Request 2 (identical to Auxiliary Request 1 submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal of the Patent Proprietor).

VII. In her response to the Opponent's statement of grounds of appeal, the Patent Proprietor presented arguments, among other things, that the subject matter of Claim 18 of Auxiliary Request 1 as submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal does not violate Article 123(2) EPC. The Patent Proprietor announced that she would address the further auxiliary requests, as necessary, during the oral proceedings.

VIII. In her response to the Patent Proprietor's statement of grounds of appeal, the Opponent presented arguments, among other things, that Auxiliary Requests 1 to 14, as submitted with the Patent Proprietor's statement of grounds of appeal, should not be admitted into the proceedings.

IX. Upon request, the Board scheduled an oral hearing. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the Board explained its preliminary assessment regarding the evaluation of the substantive requests of the parties under Article 123(2) EPC and the admission of Auxiliary Requests 1 to 14 into the proceedings.

X. By letter dated October 21, 2022, the Patent Proprietor submitted the claim set submitted as Auxiliary Request 7 with the statement of grounds of appeal as a new Auxiliary Request 2 and a new claim set as Auxiliary Request 3. All other auxiliary requests submitted in the appeal were maintained. The Patent Proprietor announced that she would not rely on these requests during the oral proceedings and presented arguments that the respective subject matter of Claim 1 of Auxiliary Requests 2 and 3 does not violate Article 123(2) EPC.

XI. By letter dated October 28, 2022, the Opponent presented arguments regarding impermissible extension of Claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 2, as submitted by the Patent Proprietor with the letter of October 21, 2022, as well as regarding the admission of Auxiliary Requests 1 to 14.

XII. During the oral proceedings, the Patent Proprietor withdrew her appeal and thus also the main request submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal. Consequently, the request submitted as Auxiliary Request 1 with the statement of grounds of appeal was treated as the main request, and the remaining auxiliary requests were renumbered accordingly. The Patent Proprietor further obtained the status of Respondent, while the Opponent remained the sole Appellant.

Claim 18 of the main request (submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal of the Patent Proprietor as Auxiliary Request 1 and identical to Auxiliary Request 2 of the contested decision) reads as follows:

""18. Recombinant strain of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, characterized in that this recombinant strain comprises a genomically integrated expression cassette composed of the lactose-inducible LAC4 promoter, a foreign gene coding for an immunogenic protein, the TEF1 transcription terminator, and the LAC4 gene coding for the enzyme β-galactosidase under the control of the GAL80 promoter of K. lactis (KlGAL80-P), wherein the targeted integration of foreign genes occurs at the LAC4 locus of the yeast genome without the introduction of additional DNA sequences, and the expression of foreign genes is induced in a dose-dependent manner by lactose or galactose or is constitutively activated after switching off the regulatory gene KlGAL80.""

Claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 1 (submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal of the Patent Proprietor as Auxiliary Request 7 and raised with the letter of October 21, 2022 for Auxiliary Request 2) and Claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 2 (submitted with the letter of October 21, 2022 as Auxiliary Request 3) have the same wording as Claim 18 of the main request.

The wording of the claims of Auxiliary Requests 3 to 14 is not relevant for the decision (see points 30 to 35 below). The Board has therefore refrained from citing the claims here.

XIII. Before the conclusion of the oral proceedings, the Chair announced the decision of the Board.

XIV. The following documents are referred to in the present decision:

D1     van Ooyen A.J.J. et al, FEMS Yeast Res 6, 2006, 381-392

D11    Krijger J.-J. et al., Microbial Cell Factories 11(1):112, 2012, 1-12

D12    Arnold M. et al., PLOS ONE 7(9), 2012, 1-11

The documents submitted by the parties in the appeal proceedings were not to be considered, as they were submitted in relation to submissions that are not the subject of the present decision.

XV. The relevant submissions of the Appellant can be summarized as follows.

Main Request - Claim 18

Auxiliary Requests 1 and 2 - Claim 1

Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

The claimed expression cassette is disclosed in the application as originally filed only in connection with a specific, specially selected and mutated K. lactis yeast strain, the strain VAK367-D4 (see Example 2, Figure 1).

Page 4, second paragraph of the application as originally filed does not describe either the claimed recombinant yeast strain or the claimed expression cassette. On page 4, lines 6 to 10, lines 17 and 18, and lines 26 to 28 of the application as originally filed, the past tense is used. Therefore, the second paragraph of page 4 does not describe K. lactis generically, but rather the strains generated in the examples, particularly K. lactis strain VAK367-D4, which allows integration at the LAC4 locus. This is indeed the only disclosed K. lactis strain that allows the targeted integration of foreign genes at the LAC4 locus without the introduction of additional DNA sequences (selection markers) by reconstituting an intact LAC4 gene at the expense of the scURA3 gene, thereby enabling selection on lactose.

The contested decision is not in line with the established case law of the Boards of Appeal regarding intermediate generalizations, as the application as originally filed teaches overall that there is a structural and functional relationship between the expression cassette and the K. lactis strains.

The skilled person reads the application as originally filed in the context of vaccination and would derive from the technical disclosure of the entirety of the application as originally filed that K. lactis strains must exhibit specific properties to be suitable for oral/mucosal vaccination (see page 3, lines 14 to 27; page 3, line 32 to page 4, line 4; page 5, lines 1 to 2). These are not found in every K. lactis strain, but only in the optimized strain VAK367-D4 (see Example 1). Therefore, the skilled person, in light of the content of the application as originally filed, would not assume that all K. lactis strains are suitable for oral/mucosal vaccination.

The teaching of the application as originally filed corresponds to the general technical knowledge (cf. document D1, page 384, left column, third paragraph, lines 6 to 8).

Consequently, the skilled person - from the application as originally filed as well as from the general technical knowledge - would have been aware that different K. lactis strains cannot simply be treated as interchangeable. A generalization is therefore not permissible.

In summary, the application as originally filed describes, on the one hand, strain VAK367-D4 as crucial for the integration of the claimed expression cassette and for use in the intended application, and on the other hand, does not explicitly disclose that the teaching of the examples can be generalized to any strain of K. lactis.

The standard for an implicit disclosure is high. An ""implicit disclosure"" does not refer to a fact that does not belong to the technical content of a document but may be suggested by it. Considerations of the skilled person do not belong to the content of the original application.

Contrary to the assertion of the Respondent, it cannot be derived from the application as originally filed that the LAC4 locus is the only decisive feature that the strains must possess to be suitable for oral vaccination and to be able to incorporate the specific expression cassette.

The arguments of the Respondent, which rely on the subsequently published documents D11 and D12, are irrelevant, as compliance with Article 123(2) EPC cannot be supported by the disclosure of subsequently published evidence (see G 2/10).

The claim is impermissibly extended, as it is not limited to the specific K. lactis strain VAK367-D4.

Auxiliary Requests 3 to 14

Admission (Article 12(4) RPBA)

Auxiliary Requests 3 to 14 should be considered as amendments (Article 12(4) RPBA). In her statement of grounds of appeal, the Respondent referred to the granted patent and failed to indicate the basis in the application as originally filed for the amendments made. Furthermore, the Respondent's submissions do not go beyond a superficial description of the amendments. In particular, the Respondent did not explain how these requests would overcome the objections raised. Therefore, these requests should not be admitted into the proceedings.

XVI. The relevant submissions of the Respondent can be summarized as follows.

Main Request - Claim 18

Auxiliary Requests 1 and 2 - Claim 1

Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

The objective of the present invention is described on page 2, lines 9 to 19, and specifically on page 3, last paragraph, to page 4, line 2, of the application as originally filed, and consists of developing an expression system based on K. lactis that allows the targeted integration of foreign genes into the yeast genome, thereby enabling corresponding antigen formulations for vaccination. According to page 4, second paragraph of the application as originally filed, the generated yeast strains are stable without selection pressure and can be cultivated to high densities. This objective is fulfilled by all K. lactis strains that exhibit the features of the claim. Strain VAK367-D4 and variants of this strain are merely preferred embodiments of the invention.

The Opposition Division correctly found that the application as originally filed is not limited to a specific K. lactis strain. Page 3, line 33, to page 4, line 16, generally discloses the objective of the application, namely the provision of K. lactis strains, preferably VAK367-D4 and variants of this strain, which allow the targeted integration of foreign genes at the LAC4 locus without the introduction of additional DNA sequences.

The Opposition Division further correctly found that the expression cassette disclosed in Example 2 is not inextricably linked to the specific K. lactis strain VAK367-D4, as there is no obvious structural or functional relationship between the two. In this context, it is irrelevant that this strain differs in other respects from other K. lactis strains.

The implied disclosure in the application as originally filed - i.e., what necessarily follows for any skilled person from the application as a whole - is part of its content.

The skilled person knows that every K. lactis strain has a LAC4 locus and would therefore implicitly derive from the disclosure of the application as originally filed on page 4, second paragraph, claims 1 to 21, and Figure 1 that the objective of the application is not to protect the specific K. lactis strain VAK367-D4, but rather to generally provide an expression system, regardless of its use for vaccination.

From documents D11 and D12, it is evident that the expression cassette of the application can be used in any strain background of K. lactis. The application as originally filed thus provides on page 4, second paragraph, a K. lactis strain with the expression cassette as claimed, which also successfully leads to the expression of foreign proteins in other K. lactis strains than VAK367-D4.

Therefore, the claim is not impermissibly extended.

Auxiliary Requests 3 to 14

Admission (Article 12(4) RPBA)

The claims of Auxiliary Requests 3 to 14 were submitted to adequately respond to the submissions of the Appellant in the appeal proceedings.

XVII. The Appellant requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the Patent.

The Respondent requested

- the dismissal of the appeal (main request), equivalent to the maintenance of the Patent in the form deemed allowable by the Opposition Division, i.e., with the claim set submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal of the Patent Proprietor as Auxiliary Request 1,

- or alternatively, the maintenance of the Patent in amended form based on the claim set

- of Auxiliary Request 1, submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal of the Patent Proprietor as Auxiliary Request 7, or

- of Auxiliary Request 2, submitted with the letter of October 21, 2022 as Auxiliary Request 3, or

- of Auxiliary Requests 3 to 7, submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal of the Patent Proprietor as Auxiliary Requests 2 to 6, or

- of Auxiliary Requests 8 to 14 as submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal of the Patent Proprietor.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal meets the requirements of Articles 106 to 108 EPC and Rule 99 EPC; it is admissible.

Main Request - Claim 18

Auxiliary Requests 1 and 2 - Claim 1

Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

Combination of the specific expression cassette from Example 2 with any K. lactis strain

2. Claim 18 of the main request is directed to a recombinant strain of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis (K. lactis), characterized in that it contains an expression cassette integrated at the LAC4 locus of the yeast genome, which is composed of the lactose-inducible LAC4 promoter, a foreign gene coding for an immunogenic protein, the TEF1 transcription terminator, and the LAC4 gene coding for the enzyme ß-galactosidase under the control of the GAL80 promoter of K. lactis (KlGAL80-P) (hereinafter referred to as ""expression cassette""). Claim 1 of auxiliary requests 1 and 2 has the same wording as claim 18 of the main request.

3. It is undisputed that the claimed expression cassette is disclosed in the application as originally filed in combination with a specific yeast strain, namely K. lactis VAK367-D4 (see Example 2 and Figure 1). This disclosure has been generalized in the claims to all K. lactis strains.

4. The opposition division decided that the claimed combination of the specific expression cassette with any K. lactis strain represents a permissible intermediate generalization.

5. An ""intermediate generalization"" refers to a modified subject matter that is a generalization of an originally disclosed embodiment and lies between this particular embodiment and an original, broadly defined definition of the invention. According to the established case law of the boards of appeal, such a generalization is only permissible if the skilled person can unambiguously recognize from the application as originally filed that the selected features are not closely related to the other features of the embodiment but refer directly and unambiguously to a more general context (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, 10th edition 2022, II.E.1.9.1.).

6. Regarding the more general context of the present application as originally filed, the opposition division found that the application is not limited to a specific K. lactis strain, as it generally discloses ""the objective of the patent [sic]"" on page 3, line 33 to page 4, line 16, namely the ""provision of K. lactis strains, preferably VAK367-D4 and variants of this strain, which allow the targeted integration of foreign genes at the LAC4 locus without the need to introduce additional DNA sequences"" (see point 13.2 of the decision).

7. Upon reviewing the relevant section of the application as originally filed, it is evident that the opposition division conflated the disclosure regarding the objective (see page 3, line 33 to page 4, line 4) and the inventive solution (see page 4, lines 6 to 28).

8. In fact, the application as originally filed (see page 3, line 33 to page 4, line 4) discloses that ""the objective [is] to develop an expression system based on Kluyveromyces lactis that allows the targeted integration of foreign genes into the yeast genome and thus enables corresponding antigen formulations. Another objective was to use a recombinant K. lactis strain that expresses a specific viral antigen for vaccination, including for mucosal/oral vaccination."" From these ""objectives,"" no technical teaching regarding an actually disclosed expression system or the K. lactis strains used in such an expression system, and thus no disclosure for the use of K. lactis strains in general as an expression system can be derived directly and unambiguously.

9. Furthermore, the text passage on page 3, line 33 to page 4, line 4, must be read in the context of the overall content of the application as originally filed. The application discloses that the aim was to develop a method ""where complete yeasts can be used for vaccination"" (see page 2, lines 9 and 10), and that ""oral/mucosal immunization requires significantly higher quantities of antigen"" than parenteral immunization (see page 3, lines 14 to 16). Only then does the application as originally filed formulate the aforementioned objectives (see point 8 above), namely that ""the objective [is] to develop an expression system based on Kluyveromyces lactis."" This expression system should, however, not only allow the ""targeted integration of foreign genes into the yeast genome"" but also enable ""corresponding antigen formulations,"" i.e., the antigen formulations required for oral/mucosal immunization (ibid.).

10. In the following paragraph (see page 4, second paragraph), the application as originally filed then discloses the solution to these objectives as follows: ""According to the invention, a K. lactis strain, preferably VAK367-D4 and variants of this strain, was generated through genetic engineering methods that allows the targeted integration of foreign genes at the LAC4 locus of the yeast genome without the need to introduce additional DNA sequences (selection markers, etc.). The recombinant yeast strains are stable without selection pressure and can be cultivated to high densities under fermentation conditions. Foreign gene expression can be induced in a dosed manner by lactose or galactose or, after switching off the regulatory gene KIGAL80, can be constitutively activated. Foreign gene expression can be quantified indirectly through the expression of an endogenous reporter gene"" (see page 4, lines 6 to 16) and that ""a series of recombinant variants based on the K. lactis strain VAK367-D4 was generated"" (see page 4, lines 17 and 18) and ""[o]ne of these recombinant K. lactis strains (see examples) was successfully used for mucosal/oral vaccination"" (see page 4, lines 26 to 28).

11. In accordance with the appellant's presentation, the board concludes that the skilled person directly and unambiguously derives from the statement ""according to the invention, a K. lactis strain, preferably VAK367-D4 and variants of this strain, was generated"" that this refers to the strains generated in the examples and specifically to the K. lactis strain VAK367-D4 (see page 5, lines 7 to 18).

12. In this strain, strain VAK367-D4, a part of the LAC4 gene was replaced by the ScURA3 gene (see Examples 1 and 2 and Figure 1). This now allows the integration of foreign genes at the LAC4 locus of strain VAK367-D4 without additional markers by selecting for growth on lactose. Using an integration vector, the disruption cassette is replaced in strain VAK367-D4 by homologous recombination such that, with the loss of the ScURA3 marker, an intact LAC4 gene is reconstructed and a foreign gene is integrated between the LAC4 promoter and the TEF1 terminator. Strain VAK367-D4 and the derived variants are indeed the only ""generated"" K. lactis strains that allow the integration of foreign genes at the LAC4 locus ""without the need to introduce additional DNA sequences (selection markers, etc.)"".

13. Contrary to the opposition division's view, the application as originally filed on page 4, lines 4 to 16, does not disclose the use of K. lactis strains in general. Moreover, the application on page 4, second paragraph, does not disclose the claimed expression cassette or a K. lactis strain with this expression cassette as claimed, contrary to the respondent's assertions.

14. Furthermore, the opposition division was of the opinion that the claimed expression cassette is not inextricably linked to the specific K. lactis strain VAK367-D4, as ""there is no evidence that the genetic modifications described in Example 1 for the production of 'VAK367-D4', which are necessary for effective integration of the vector, cannot also be performed with any other K. lactis strain"" (see point 13.2.1 of the contested decision). The fact that the starting strain differs from other K. lactis strains by high cell densities and lysis resistance was considered irrelevant by the opposition division for any potential link between strain and expression cassette.

15. The criterion of a lack of evidence invoked by the opposition division in this context pertains at most to questions of obviousness and not to questions of the disclosure of the application as originally filed.

16. To meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, conversely, the application would need to contain an indication that the features omitted in the claim compared to Example 2 are not essential or optional for the expression system developed based on K. lactis VAK367-D4, which is provided in the application as the inventive solution. This indication is absent in the application. As already stated above, the objective of the application was to provide an expression system that not only allows the ""targeted integration of foreign genes into the yeast genome"" but also should enable ""corresponding antigen formulations,"" i.e., the antigen formulations required for oral/mucosal immunization.

17. The development of K. lactis strain VAK367-D4 is described in Example 1 of the application as originally filed (see page 4, line 30 to page 5, line 18 and point 11 above). The starting strain for the development of strain VAK367-D4 was strain VAK367, which was derived from strain CBS 2359 by mutagenesis and differs from related K. lactis strains in that it ""allows cultivation to high cell densities without detectable release of intracellular proteins"" (see page 4, line 34 to page 5, line 3).

18. The skilled person reading the application as originally filed in the context of the intended use of K. lactis strains for vaccination (see in particular page 2, lines 9 to 10; page 3, lines 14 to 27; page 3, line 32 to page 4, line 4; page 5, lines 1 to 2 as well as points 8 and 9 above) recognizes that K. lactis strains must exhibit specific properties to be suitable for oral/mucosal vaccination, which are not found in every K. lactis strain but only in the optimized strain VAK367-D4. In particular, the ability to be cultivated to high cell densities without detectable release of intracellular proteins is required to produce sufficient amounts of antigen and to be able to use the complete yeast for vaccination. This property is highlighted in the application as originally filed as a characteristic in which strain VAK367 differs from many closely related K. lactis strains (see page 5, lines 1 to 2 of the application and point 17 above).

19. Furthermore, the skilled person is aware that K. lactis strains differ in their expression of heterologous proteins (see document D1, page 384, left column, third paragraph, lines 6 to 8). Consequently, the skilled person also understood that different K. lactis strains cannot simply be regarded as interchangeable. Therefore, the skilled person would not have derived from the application as originally filed, even with reference to general technical knowledge, that the K. lactis strain VAK367-D4 can be replaced in the provided expression system by any other K. lactis strain.

20. In summary, the application as originally filed thus discloses a structural and functional connection between the expression cassette and the K. lactis strain VAK367-D4. Furthermore, the application does not disclose a general teaching that all K. lactis strains can be used as an expression system or that an expression system is provided that can be used generally for the expression of proteins, regardless of vaccination.

21. The argumentation of the opposition division cannot therefore be convincing. To the extent that the respondent has relied on the arguments of the opposition division in their submissions, this cannot be convincing either.

22. The respondent also argued that the skilled person knows that every K. lactis strain has a LAC4 locus and therefore would implicitly derive from the disclosure of the application on page 4, second paragraph, claims 1 to 21, and Figure 1 that the objective of the application is not the protection of the K. lactis VAK367-D4 strain, but rather the general provision of an expression system, regardless of the use for vaccination.

23. This argument also cannot be convincing. First, it cannot be derived from the application as originally filed that the LAC4 locus is the only decisive feature that K. lactis strains must possess. On the contrary, the application discloses that the entire expression system, including the yeast strain, must meet certain requirements to be suitable for oral vaccination and to be able to accommodate the specific expression cassette without the introduction of additional DNA sequences (see points 12 and 18 above).

24. Second, any considerations that the skilled person might make in light of the disclosure of the application and the presence of the LAC4 gene in other K. lactis strains go beyond what the skilled person derives as an immediate and unambiguous conclusion from the disclosure of the application as originally filed. Therefore, the skilled person's knowledge that every K. lactis strain has a LAC4 locus does not lead to the implicit disclosure of a general expression system based on K. lactis.

25. Finally, the respondent argued that documents D11 and D12, published after the application, show that the expression cassette of the application can be used in any strain background of K. lactis, which proves that the application as originally filed on page 4, second paragraph, generally provides a K. lactis strain with the expression cassette as claimed.

26. This line of argument cannot be convincing for two reasons. First, it pertains at most to questions of the workability of the claimed invention in the sense of Article 83 EPC. Second, compliance with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC cannot be supported by reference to post-published evidence. The ""gold standard"" for compliance with Article 123(2) EPC means that amendments may only be made within the limits of what a skilled person can derive directly and unambiguously from the entirety of the application as originally filed, using general technical knowledge - objectively and with respect to the filing date (see decision of the Enlarged Board of Appeal G 2/10, OJ EPO 2012, 376, point 4.3 of the reasoning).

27. For the aforementioned reasons, the board concludes that the linking of the feature of the expression cassette disclosed in Example 2 with all K. lactis strains leads to a subject matter that the skilled person cannot derive directly and unambiguously from the application as originally filed, using general technical knowledge - objectively and with respect to the filing date.

28. Therefore, the subject matter of claim 18 of the main request and thus also of claim 1 of auxiliary requests 1 and 2 goes beyond the content of the application as originally filed. These requests are therefore not allowable under Article 123(2) EPC.

Auxiliary Requests 3 to 14

Admissibility (Article 12(4) RPBA)

29. The question of the admissibility of auxiliary requests 3 to 14 was to be assessed in accordance with Article 12(4) RPBA, in force since January 1, 2020 (see Articles 24 and 25 RPBA).

30. Auxiliary requests 3 to 14 were not part of the contested decision, and the respondent has not shown that these requests were presented and maintained in an admissible manner during the opposition proceedings.

31. According to Article 12(4) sentence 1 RPBA, auxiliary requests 3 to 14 are therefore to be considered as amendments, and it is at the discretion of the board to admit such amendments.

32. The respondent's appeal brief contains information about the claim changes made in the auxiliary requests and the basis of the changes in the patent specification [sic]. However, according to Article 12(4) sentence 4 RPBA (as well as Article 123(2) EPC), the respondent should have indicated the basis of the changes in the application as originally filed. As correctly pointed out by the appellant, the content of the patent specification and the application as originally filed, for example regarding K. lactis VAK367-D4, differ from each other.

33. Furthermore, according to Article 12(4) sentence 4 RPBA, the respondent should not only have indicated the basis of the changes in the application as originally filed but also justified why they should be made in the appeal proceedings and why the respective amendment would address the objections raised.

34. In their appeal brief (see page 4, II), the respondent merely noted that the claims of auxiliary requests 3 to 14 would be submitted ""to adequately respond to the submissions of the opponent [appellant] in the appeal proceedings."" In their reply to the appellant's appeal brief (see page 20, VII), the respondent then announced that they would ""address these requests in the oral appeal hearing as necessary."" In response to the board's communication (see page 1, penultimate paragraph), the respondent finally stated that they would ""not rely on these auxiliary requests in the oral proceedings."" At no point did the respondent assert that a justification was unnecessary because it is obvious which objection is addressed by the introduced changes. The board therefore concludes that the respondent's submissions do not constitute a sufficient justification in the sense of Article 12(4) RPBA.

35. The board has therefore decided, in the exercise of its discretion under Article 12(4) RPBA, not to admit auxiliary requests 3 to 14 into the proceedings.

Conclusion

36. Since none of the claims pending in the proceedings are allowable, the patent is to be revoked.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2.

I. The appeal of the opponent (appellant) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to maintain European Patent No. 3 030 218 in amended form under Article 101(3)(a) EPC.

II. An opposition was filed against the patent based on Articles 100(a), (b), and (c) EPC. The patent proprietor defended the patent in amended form. The opposition division concluded in the contested decision that the main request of the patent proprietor met the requirements of the EPC. In particular, the claimed subject matter had not been amended in an inadmissible manner (Articles 123(2) and (3) EPC). Furthermore, the claimed invention was disclosed in a manner sufficiently clear for the skilled person (Article 83 EPC). Finally, the claimed subject matter was novel over the disclosures of documents D1, D3, and D6 (Article 54 EPC) and involved an inventive step (Article 56 EPC). The opposition division considered document D4 as the closest prior art. Document D13 was admitted into the proceedings, but document D14 was not.

III. The opponent filed an appeal against this decision in a timely manner. They argue that the decision of the opposition division was erroneous in recognizing sufficient disclosure (Articles 100(b) and 83 EPC) and the presence of an inventive step (Articles 100(a) and 56 EPC). Furthermore, it was erroneous not to admit document D14 into the proceedings.

IV. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the board communicated its preliminary opinion on the legal and factual situation to the parties.

V. An oral hearing took place on November 7, 2023, at which the decision was announced.

VI. The present main request (the patent as maintained by the opposition division) contains three independent claims with the following wording:

""1. Gel-like cosmetic preparation comprising

a) ethanol,

b) one or more UV filters,

c) hydroxypropylcellulose with a molecular weight of less than 1000 kg/mol, measured by size exclusion chromatography,

d) one or more fatty alcohols chosen from the group of compounds cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, characterized in that the total amount (sum) of cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and myristyl alcohol in the preparation is from 2.5 to 7.5 wt.%, based on the total weight of the preparation.""

""2. Method for reducing the formation of rolls when

rubbing a gel-like cosmetic preparation comprising ethanol, one or more UV filters, and hydroxypropylcellulose with a molecular weight of less than 1000 kg/mol, measured by size exclusion chromatography, on the skin, characterized in that one or more fatty alcohols chosen from the group of compounds cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol are added to the preparation.""

""3. Use of one or more fatty alcohols

chosen from the group of compounds cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol for reducing the formation of rolls when rubbing a gel-like cosmetic preparation comprising ethanol, one or more UV filters, and hydroxypropylcellulose with a molecular weight of less than 1000 kg/mol, measured by size exclusion chromatography, on the skin.""

VII. The following documents are referred to:

D12: Comparative test of the respondent, submitted on July 23, 2019

D13: WO 2007/140442 A2

D14: Supplemental technical data, comparative test of the appellant, submitted on February 3, 2020

VIII. In its statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

Document D14 should have been admitted into the proceedings by the opposition division. It was submitted in response to the document D12 submitted by the respondent. The late submission was due to the unavailability of starting materials. Moreover, the document is prima facie relevant. Finally, the respondent has had sufficient time to respond to it with their own tests at least in the appeal proceedings.

The subject matter claimed in the main request is not disclosed in the patent in a manner that is executable by the skilled person. It is neither shown that the addition of hydroxypropylcellulose with a molecular weight of less than 1000 kg/mol to a cosmetic preparation always leads to a reduction in the formation of rolls, nor is it shown that this is the case for all the fatty alcohols claimed.

Finally, the claimed subject matter does not involve an inventive step. Starting from one of the documents D4 or D13 as the closest prior art, no special technical effect can be asserted due to the lack of suitable comparative tests for the respective distinguishing features. The actual objective technical problem solved is therefore merely seen in providing alternative preparations, methods, or uses. The claimed solutions to these problems are suggested to the skilled person, especially considering the additional documents D10 and D11.

IX. In its response to the statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the patent proprietor (respondent) essentially argued as follows:

The opposition division correctly exercised its discretion and therefore rightly did not admit document D14 into the proceedings. There are also no reasons that would support the admission of the document into the appeal proceedings.

The patent itself discloses the claimed subject matter in such a way that it is executable by a skilled person. This is also confirmed by document D12.

The claimed subject matter is also not suggested to the skilled person, regardless of whether the disclosure of document D4 or D13 is considered as the closest prior art. In both cases, the respective distinguishing feature produces a special technical effect. This is evidenced by the submitted comparative tests. Therefore, the actual technical problem solved is seen in providing preparations, methods, or uses that are improved with respect to the formation of rolls occurring upon application to the skin. The claimed solutions are not suggested to the skilled person even when considering the additional documents cited by the appellant. In particular, no connection between the distinguishing features and the demonstrated technical effects can be derived from them.

X. Requests of the parties:

The appellant requests the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent. They further request the admission of document D14 into the proceedings and the non-admission of auxiliary request 4.

The respondent requests the dismissal of the appeal as the main request, thereby maintaining the patent in the form upheld by the opposition division. Alternatively, they request the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent in amended form based on auxiliary requests 1 to 4 submitted with the response to the statement of grounds of appeal.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

Document D14, Admission

2. Document D14 discloses experimental data. It was submitted by the appellant in the opposition proceedings, specifically just two days before the oral proceedings before the opposition division. The opposition division did not admit the document into the proceedings. It justified this by stating that it was submitted late, and therefore the patent holder could no longer verify the experiments. Furthermore, the division found that the described experiments were also not relevant prima facie.

3. The appellant disagreed with this view. In its opinion, it was not convincing that the respondent could not verify the accuracy of the experiments presented in document D14. Although the respondent had claimed that the necessary substances for conducting the experiments were initially not available on the market, they should have been available to the respondent. Moreover, the respondent had sufficient time at least until the drafting of its response to the appeal to possibly repeat the experiments.

There was also prima facie relevance. According to independent claims 1 to 3 of the main request, the claimed preparation may also contain additional components. In particular, in addition to hydroxypropyl cellulose with a molecular weight of less than 1000 kg/mol, the presence of hydroxypropyl cellulose with a higher molecular weight is also possible, in any amount. Document D14 shows that with such - also claimed - preparations, no reduction in bead formation can be achieved. This demonstrates a lack of enablement.

4. The board does not agree with the appellant's argumentation for the following reasons:

4.1 According to Article 12(6) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA), the board does not admit evidence that was not admitted in the proceedings leading to the contested decision, unless the decision on non-admission was made in an unreasonable manner or the circumstances of the appeal justify admission.

4.2 The decision of the opposition division was not made in an unreasonable manner. Rather, the opposition division correctly exercised its discretion granted under Article 114(2) EPC. The decision not to admit the document into the proceedings was made neither on the basis of incorrect criteria nor in an arbitrary or inappropriate manner (see point 2.2 of the reasons for the decision).

4.3 In particular, the opposition division correctly stated in its decision that the submission of document D14 occurred after the deadline set according to Rule 116 EPC, and was therefore late.

4.4 The opposition division then explained that the late submission was justified only by poor market availability of the starting materials on the one hand, and on the other hand, that the necessity for conducting the experiments disclosed in document D14 only became apparent with the submission of document D12 by the respondent. It explained convincingly why these reasons were not convincing, namely particularly because there was sufficient time after the submission of D12 to submit additional experiments in a timely manner. Furthermore, it was unreasonable to expect the respondent to react to the experimental data within two days. This is especially true since the appellant itself had already raised issues regarding the market availability of the starting materials.

4.5 The opposition division further stated that the experiments described in the document were, in its opinion, not relevant prima facie. It justified this by stating that the experiments related to unrealistic embodiments. In the examined compositions, an undesirable gelling agent was used in significant excess at the expense of the desired gelling agent. Such a combined application of hydroxypropyl celluloses has no basis in the application. Moreover, the experimental results did not allow for an assessment of a reduction in bead formation, as it was only generally evaluated whether bead formation occurred or not.

4.6 The board also sees no circumstances in the appeal case that would justify the admission of document D14 at this time.

4.7 The appellant did not provide any explanations in the appeal proceedings beyond those presented in the opposition proceedings regarding the specific problems it encountered in obtaining the starting materials needed for the conducted experiments. Furthermore, the board sees no reason why the necessity to conduct and submit the experiments described in document D14 should only have arisen through the document D12 submitted by the respondent. The respondent relied on document D12 to support its argument regarding the presence of inventive step (see point ii) on page 3 of the respondent's submission of June 21, 2019). In contrast, the appellant relies on document D14 to demonstrate a lack of enablement of the claimed invention. This objection had already been raised by the appellant at the beginning of the opposition proceedings. Therefore, the appellant's argumentation is not convincing.

4.8 Furthermore, the document is also not relevant prima facie. The preparations disclosed therein, 1 and 2, are both assessed with ""Yes"" regarding bead formation. There is no quantification of bead formation. Thus, the document does not reveal how, or by which specific measure, a change, particularly a reduction in bead formation, is achieved or not. According to claims 2 and 3 of the main request, however, a method for reducing bead formation or the use of certain alcohols to reduce bead formation is claimed. None of the claims require that no bead formation occurs at all. However, since document D14 does not disclose an assessment of a reduction in bead formation, it cannot serve to support the argumentation presented by the appellant regarding a lack of enablement.

4.9 Therefore, the board does not admit document D14 into the proceedings (Article 12(6) RPBA).

Main Request (as maintained by the opposition division)

5. Enablement (Article 83 EPC)

5.1 The opposition division rejected the ground for opposition of lack of enablement.

5.2 In the appeal proceedings, the appellant maintained its objection. It argued essentially that the addition of hydroxypropyl cellulose with a molecular weight of less than 1000 kg/mol does not necessarily lead to a reduction in bead formation when applying the preparation to the skin. This cannot be achieved, particularly when the preparation already contains hydroxypropyl cellulose with a molecular weight of more than 1000 kg/mol.

5.3 The appellant also questioned the significance of the experiments disclosed in document D12 by the respondent. None of the preparations mentioned therein correspond to a claimed definition, as the total amount of fatty alcohol is each time less than the claimed range of 2.5 to 7.5 weight-%.

5.4 Finally, the appellant argued that the patent itself only discloses results from preparations containing cetyl alcohol. No further experiments to demonstrate a technical effect attributable to the other claimed fatty alcohols, cetearyl alcohol and myristyl alcohol, are disclosed. Therefore, the claimed subject matter is at least not enabled across the entire scope of the claims.

5.5 The appellant's argumentation is not convincing. The board agrees with the assessment of the opposition division for the following reasons:

5.5.1 Claim 1 of the main request relates to a gel-like cosmetic preparation containing components a) to d), wherein component d), i.e., at least one of the mentioned fatty alcohols, is present in an amount of 2.5 to 7.5 weight-% of the total weight of the preparation. To meet the requirements of Article 83 EPC, the skilled person must be able to produce such a preparation. For this, both the information in the patent itself and the general knowledge of the skilled person are available.

5.5.2 The patent, particularly in the examples, discloses that the preparation of the claimed formulations is possible. Document D12 also supports this finding. Even if the amount of the fatty alcohol used (cetearyl alcohol) in the examples 7 and 8 disclosed in document D12 is indeed below the claimed range, as argued by the appellant and apparently confirmed by document D2, the appellant did not credibly demonstrate why a further increase in the proportion of fatty alcohol would present insurmountable obstacles preventing the skilled person from producing a claimed preparation. Likewise, the appellant did not argue or even prove why the skilled person should not also be able to produce claimed preparations using the two other fatty alcohols mentioned in the claim instead of cetyl alcohol.

5.5.3 Therefore, the skilled person is already enabled by the information in the patent itself to produce preparations according to claim 1.

5.5.4 Independent claim 2 relates to a method for reducing bead formation when applying a gel-like cosmetic preparation to the skin. The claimed method is characterized in that certain fatty alcohols are added to a claimed defined preparation.

5.5.5 To carry out the claimed method, the skilled person must first be able to produce a gel-like cosmetic preparation containing the mentioned components. As stated above, this is the case. Furthermore, the experiments described in paragraphs [0041] and [0042] of the patent show that the addition of the fatty alcohol cetyl alcohol reduces the tendency for bead formation. Thus, the patent itself discloses an example that the method according to claim 2 is enabled.

5.5.6 Although it was questioned by the appellant that a similar result could also be achieved by adding one of the other fatty alcohols mentioned in the claim, no arguments or even evidence were presented as to why this should not be the case. Moreover, as argued by the respondent, the mentioned alcohols are structurally similar compounds. The board also sees no reasons why the effect indicated in the example of the description should not also occur with the other two claimed fatty alcohols.

5.5.7 Thus, the skilled person is enabled to repeat the subject matter of claim 2.

5.5.8 Independent claim 3 relates to the use of certain fatty alcohols to reduce bead formation when applying a gel-like cosmetic preparation containing certain components specified in the claim.

5.5.9 The example disclosed in paragraphs [0041] and [0042] of the patent particularly shows that the claimed use is repeatable. For the reasons stated above, it cannot be assumed that the claimed technical effect is not achieved when using the other two claimed fatty alcohols.

5.5.10 Therefore, the subject matter of claim 3 in the patent is also enabled for the skilled person.

5.5.11 The appellant's argumentation partly relates to the assertion that in the presence of hydroxypropyl cellulose with a molecular weight of more than 1000 kg/mol in the cosmetic preparations, a reduction in bead formation cannot be achieved.

5.5.12 However, the addition of such compounds to achieve a certain technical effect is not required by the claims. For the question of enablement, it is only necessary that the claimed defined preparations can be produced and used. Although these preparations, as argued by the appellant, are not limited to those that only contain the components mentioned in the claim, the appellant's argumentation is not convincing because it cannot be assumed that the skilled person should provide embodiments that do not produce the intended technical effect. Particularly not, as such embodiments are not proposed in the patent. They would merely need to avoid adding compounds that are not required by the claims. This would evidently lead them to embodiments that are enabled, as shown by the examples in the patent.

5.5.13 Furthermore, the appellant argued that lack of enablement is also demonstrated by the experimental evidence in document D12. A comparison of the preparations disclosed therein shows that a reduction in bead formation is not achieved by the addition of a claimed fatty alcohol, but rather by the presence of a hydroxypropyl cellulose of the type ""MF Pharm"" with a molecular weight of less than 1000 kg/mol, instead of the type ""H CS"" with a molecular weight of more than 1000 kg/mol. However, in claims 2 and 3, the claimed effect is attributed to the mentioned fatty alcohols, while the role of the molecular weight of the hydroxypropyl celluloses is not addressed. Therefore, claims 2 and 3 do not contain all essential features of the invention.

5.5.14 This argumentation is also not convincing.

Document D12 does not provide any statement regarding a correlation between the presence of one of the fatty alcohols mentioned in the claim and the tendency for bead formation. Both of the preparations disclosed in D12 contain the same amount of the same alcohol. They only differ in the molecular weight of the hydroxypropyl celluloses used. In particular, the document does not indicate that the addition of the mentioned alcohol to a preparation containing the remaining components does not lead to a reduction in bead formation. Rather, a comparison of the two preparations shows that a reduction in bead formation is achieved by replacing the hydroxypropyl cellulose of type ""H CS"" with one of type ""MF Pharm"". However, this correlation cannot support the appellant's assertion that the skilled person cannot repeat the method according to claim 2 or the use according to claim 3. Rather, the comparison of the two examples merely concludes that other factors, such as the molecular weight of the hydroxypropyl cellulose used, are also suitable for reducing bead formation. The respondent confirmed this correlation during the oral proceedings.

5.6 The arguments presented by the appellant are therefore overall not suitable to demonstrate a lack of enablement. The present main request meets the requirements of Article 83 EPC.

6. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

The Patent in Dispute

6.1 The patent in dispute relates to gel-like cosmetic preparations for protecting the skin from the effects of solar radiation. It specifically addresses transparent gels based on water or alcohol that are thickened with cellulose derivatives. The description refers to the problem of bead formation occurring when applying and rubbing sunscreen gels on the skin (see paragraphs [0001], [0005], and [0006]). To reduce this effect, the claimed preparations propose to include, in addition to alcohol and UV filters, hydroxypropyl cellulose with a molecular weight of less than 1000 kg/mol, as well as one or more selected fatty alcohols in an amount of 2.5 to 7.5 weight-%. A method for reducing bead formation on the skin is also claimed, as well as the use of one or more selected fatty alcohols to reduce bead formation when applying a gel-like cosmetic preparation to the skin.

Closest Prior Art

6.2 In its decision, the opposition division recognized inventive step based on the disclosure of document D4 as the closest prior art. In the appeal proceedings, the appellant also cited document D13 as an alternative closest prior art. This was not contested by the respondent.

6.3 Both documents D4 and D13 are suitable as the closest prior art. They deal with cosmetic preparations, particularly sunscreens, and address the issue of bead formation (D4: see paragraphs [0009], [0012], and [0063] as well as examples 1 to 6, 7, and 10; D13: see lines 4 and 5 as well as 26 to 30 on page 1 and the examples on pages 16 to 18).

Claim 1 - Gel-like Cosmetic Preparation

6.4 Document D4 as the Closest Prior Art

Distinguishing Feature

6.4.1 Document D4 discloses in examples 7 and 10 preparations in the form of emulsions that contain, in addition to ethanol and several UV filters, cetearyl alcohol. In contrast to the ""hydroxypropyl cellulose with a molecular weight of less than 1000 kg/mol"" contained in the preparations according to claim 1, they contain either ""carbomer"" (example 7) or ""acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer"" (example 10) as thickening agents. This was undisputed between the parties.

6.4.2 The respondent initially argued in the written proceedings that the preparations according to examples 7 and 10 are emulsions, but not necessarily gel-like preparations. However, for the present decision, it is not relevant whether this constitutes another distinguishing feature, as inventive step is already present when considering the nature of the thickening agent. Therefore, it can be disregarded whether the preparations of examples 7 and 10 of document D4 are gel-like preparations or not.

Technical Problem

6.4.3 The parties disputed what technical effect is caused by the distinguishing feature of the different thickening agent and how the objective technical problem should be defined.

6.4.4 The appellant argued that there is insufficient evidence that the presence of ""hydroxypropyl cellulose with a molecular weight of less than 1000 kg/mol"" leads to a particular technical effect. It justified this view by stating that the patent itself does not disclose any examples that could credibly demonstrate a technical effect attributable to this distinguishing feature. Rather, it follows from the patent, paragraph [0042], that preparations containing hydroxypropyl cellulose with a molecular weight of less than 1000 kg/mol also tend to bead formation.

6.4.5 The document D12 cited by the respondent could not provide this either, as the experiments disclosed therein are not claimed. The examined compositions contained only 1.95 weight-% of the fatty alcohol cetearyl alcohol, whereas a proportion of between 2.5 and 7.5 weight-% is required according to the claims. Furthermore, document D12 makes comparisons to document D1. However, this is prior art according to Article 54(3) EPC, and thus not the closest prior art. The experiments are therefore not significant.

6.4.6 Moreover, document D12 only describes experiments using preparations that contained cetearyl alcohol. However, the claims also include preparations that alternatively contain cetyl alcohol or myristyl alcohol. No experiments using these alcohols are provided. Therefore, a technical effect cannot be claimed.

6.4.7 Thus, the technical problem to be solved can only be seen in providing alternative preparations.

6.4.8 The respondent argued that the distinguishing feature of the presence of ""hydroxypropyl cellulose with a molecular weight of less than 1000 kg/mol"" leads to a reduction in bead formation, particularly in combination with at least one of the claimed fatty alcohols. This is demonstrated by document D12.

6.4.9 Therefore, the solved technical problem can be seen in providing improved preparations that are characterized by reduced bead formation compared to the gels of document D4.

6.4.10 The board agrees with the respondent's argumentation.

6.4.11 It is correct that the appellant's assertion that the patent itself, although mentioning reduced bead formation as a problem, does not contain experimental data from which a particular technical effect caused by the distinguishing feature of the used hydroxypropyl cellulose can be derived. However, the results of document D12 are convincing.

6.4.12 In document D12, two preparations are evaluated regarding their tendency to form beads after being rubbed on the skin. The two examined preparations differ only in the hydroxypropyl cellulose used. Preparation 7 contains ""hydroxypropyl cellulose MF Pharm,"" while preparation 8 contains ""hydroxypropyl cellulose H CS."" According to document D11, these are polysaccharides with molecular weights of 850 kg/mol and 1150 kg/mol, respectively. Thus, the ""hydroxypropyl cellulose MF Pharm"" used in preparation 7 with 850 kg/mol is within the claimed range, while the ""hydroxypropyl cellulose H CS"" used in preparation 8 with 1150 kg/mol is outside. As a result, document D12 rates preparation 7 better regarding the occurrence of beads.

6.4.13 The appellant argued that no relevant technical effect for the claimed preparation can be derived from the results of document D12, as neither of the two preparations examined in document D12 is claimed. They each contain too little fatty alcohol.

6.4.14 The appellant's assertion can only be agreed with to the extent that both preparations have less cetearyl alcohol than the claimed amount of 2.5 to 7.5 weight-%. They contain 3 parts of a mixture of ""cetearyl alcohol + dicethyl phosphate + ceteth-10 phosphate."" This mixture contains only about 65% cetearyl alcohol (see document D2). Therefore, the two preparations contain only about 1.95% cetearyl alcohol. This was not disputed by the respondent.

6.4.15 However, this does not lead to the conclusion that the technical effect claimed by the respondent does not occur even when a slightly higher content of cetearyl alcohol is used. Although the appellant claimed otherwise, it did not substantiate this assertion with further explanations or even experimental evidence. The board also sees no reason why the results should not be transferable to preparations that have a higher, claimed content of cetearyl alcohol.

6.4.16 Furthermore, the appellant argued that the experiments according to document D12 were only intended to demonstrate a technical effect compared to the disclosure of document D1. Therefore, they are not significant in relation to D4 as the closest prior art.

6.4.17 This argumentation is also not convincing. The experiments as such are, as explained above, suitable for demonstrating a technical effect compared to document D4, regardless of whether other conclusions can also be drawn.

6.4.18 Thus, it has been shown that the use of hydroxypropyl cellulose with a molecular weight of less than 1000 kg/mol in a preparation defined according to claim 1 of the main request leads to a lower bead formation than the use of hydroxypropyl cellulose with a higher molecular weight.

6.4.19 The objective technical problem to be solved is therefore to provide, starting from one of the examples 7 or 10 of document D4, a gel-like cosmetic preparation that leads to a lower bead formation when applied to the skin.

Proposed Solution

6.4.20 To solve the technical problem, the provision of gel-like preparations according to claim 1 is proposed, which contain hydroxypropyl cellulose with a molecular weight of less than 1000 kg/mol.

The board is convinced that the proposed measure can solve the technical problem for the reasons explained above.

Non-Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

6.4.21 The appellant argued that the technical problem defined by it as providing alternatives is solved only in an obvious manner. In particular, the use of the mentioned hydroxypropyl celluloses is already known to the skilled person from document D4 itself, as well as from documents D11, D13, and D10.

6.4.22 This argumentation is not effective. Rather, for the question of the obviousness of the proposed solution, the actually solved technical problem must be considered. This is, however, to provide preparations that are improved regarding bead formation.

6.4.23 In this regard, the board notes that while the documents cited by the appellant, D11, D13, and D10, disclose hydroxypropyl celluloses with a molecular weight of less than 1000 kg/mol, which thus fall within the claimed range (see D10: example 7; D11: table 1; D13: examples on pages 16 to 18 and page 7, lines 5 to 6), none of the documents refers to a correlation between the use of these compounds as components of gel-like cosmetic preparations and a related reduction in bead formation occurring after rubbing. The problems are not addressed in documents D10 and D11. Furthermore, document D10 discloses in example 7 a preparation that contains neither ethanol nor any of the claimed fatty alcohols. Document D11 mentions disadvantages of the hydroxypropyl cellulose of type H with a molecular weight of 1150 kg/mol, but only regarding its tendency to a viscosity reduction occurring over time. Document D13 refers to the problem of bead formation (see particularly lines 26 to 30 on page 1), but the problem is solved there by combining a cellulose polymer as a rheology additive (e.g., a hydroxypropyl cellulose with a molecular weight of 850 kg/mol) with a cationic polymer, particularly ""Polyquaternium 37"" (see the aforementioned examples). The document specifically points out that the tendency for bead formation is reduced by combining the two substances (see lines 10 to 15 on page 7). It also explicitly refers to the necessarily present cationic polymer as an ""anti-pilling agent"" (see page 7, line 10 to page 8, line 5), but not to the occurrence of such an effect through hydroxypropyl cellulose. Finally, document D4 does not specify any molecular weights of the proposed hydroxypropyl celluloses (see paragraph [0035] and examples 1 to 6).

6.4.24 In summary, it can therefore be stated that the provision of preparations according to claim 1 of the main request starting from document D4 as the closest prior art, even considering the further documents cited, is not obvious to the skilled person for solving the stated technical problem.

6.5 Document D13 as the Closest Prior Art

Distinguishing Feature

6.5.1 Document D13 discloses in examples ""Inventive example 1"" to ""Inventive Example 3"" cosmetic preparations in the form of gels (see pages 16 to 18). These preparations contain, in addition to ethanol (""alcohol""), various UV filters as well as ""Klucel Hydroxypropyl-cellulose M."" This is a hydroxypropyl cellulose with a molecular weight of 850 kg/mol (see document D11, page 5). The preparation according to claim 1 of the main request contains, in contrast to the preparations according to D13, at least one of the three fatty alcohols cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol. This was undisputed between the parties.

Technical Problem

6.5.2 The patent discloses in the table of paragraph [0041] two preparations that differ only in that one contains 5.00 m[%] cetyl alcohol (preparation in the left column), while the other does not (preparation in the right column). The first preparation is therefore claimed, while the second is not. This was also undisputed.

6.5.3 According to paragraph [0042] of the patent, the preparation with cetyl alcohol does not show a tendency for bead formation, in contrast to the preparation without cetyl alcohol. The lower tendency for bead formation is thus caused by the distinguishing feature of the presence of 5 weight-% cetyl alcohol, i.e., the distinguishing feature compared to the closest prior art D13. This was also undisputed.

6.5.4 The appellant argued that in the cited example of the patent, only one of the three fatty alcohols mentioned in the claim is used. However, it is not shown that the observed technical effect also occurs when using cetearyl alcohol or myristyl alcohol. Therefore, the actual technical problem solved can again only be seen in providing alternative gel-like cosmetic preparations.

6.5.5 The appellant's argumentation is not convincing, particularly not in light of the respondent's argumentation. The respondent pointed out that cetearyl alcohol contains both stearyl alcohol and cetyl alcohol, which was not disputed by the appellant. Thus, it is credible that a comparable effect occurs for cetearyl alcohol as for cetyl alcohol. Regarding myristyl alcohol, the appellant credibly argued that none of the submitted documents suggests that the use of myristyl alcohol would lead to incompatibility with the other components of the claimed preparation or that it would even be expected to increase bead formation. The board also notes that the appellant has not presented any arguments or even experimental evidence as to why the technical effect observed with cetyl alcohol should not also occur for the other mentioned fatty alcohols.

6.5.6 The objective technical problem to be solved based on the disclosure of document D13 is therefore to provide a cosmetic preparation that is characterized by a lower bead formation when applied to the skin.

Proposed Solution

6.5.7 To solve the stated problem, the main request proposes preparations that contain one or more of the fatty alcohols cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol in a total amount of 2.5 to 7.5 weight-%.

6.5.8 For the reasons stated above, the board is convinced that the proposed solution can solve the stated technical problem.

Non-Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

6.5.9 The respondent did not dispute that the claimed fatty alcohols cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol are known to the skilled person, as well as their use in cosmetic preparations (see examples 7 and 10 in document D4). However, none of the cited documents provides the skilled person with a hint that the addition of these fatty alcohols to the preparations disclosed in document D13 leads to a reduction in bead formation when applied to the skin.

6.5.10 Thus, the provision of preparations according to claim 1 of the main request starting from document D13 as the closest prior art, even considering the further cited documents for solving the stated technical problem, is based on an inventive step.

Independent Claims 2 and 3

6.6 Regarding independent claims 2 and 3 of the main request, no further arguments were presented by either party. The findings under points 6.4.24 and 6.5.10 also apply for the reasons stated to claims 2 and 3 of the present main request:

6.6.1 Claim 2 is directed to a method for reducing bead formation when applying a gel-like cosmetic preparation that contains, among other things, hydroxypropyl cellulose with a molecular weight of less than 1000 kg/mol. In the claimed method, one or more of the fatty alcohols cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, or myristyl alcohol are added to the preparation. The claimed subject matter therefore differs from the disclosure of documents D4 or D13 at least by the same features as the preparation according to claim 1 of the main request. Therefore, the method also relies on an inventive step for the reasons mentioned for claim 1 in accordance with Article 56 EPC.

6.6.2 Claim 3 is directed to the use of one or more of the fatty alcohols cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, or myristyl alcohol to reduce bead formation when applying a gel-like cosmetic preparation that contains, among other things, hydroxypropyl cellulose with a molecular weight of less than 10000 kg/mol. The claimed subject matter therefore again differs from the disclosure of documents D4 or D13 at least by the same features as the preparation according to claim 1 of the main request. Therefore, the claimed use also relies on an inventive step for the reasons mentioned for claim 1 in accordance with Article 56 EPC.

Summary of the Main Request

7. In summary, it can be stated that none of the reasons presented by the appellant against the patentability of the main request are conclusive.

Further Requests

8. Since none of the reasons presented against the maintenance of the patent based on the main request are valid, auxiliary requests 1 to 4 can be disregarded.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,appeal dismissed,L'OREAL,L'OREAL 14 rue Royale 75008 Paris / FR,Cabinet Nony 11 rue Saint-Georges 75009 Paris / FR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeal of the opponents is directed against the decision of the opposition division to reject the opposition against European Patent No. 2 601 341. The granted claim 1 has the following wording:

""1. Use of a textile treatment agent with a pH value in the range of 1.5 to 4.5, comprising

a) an organic acid,

b) an inorganic acid,

c) a non-ionic surfactant, and

d) a deodorizing compound

in the washing, cleaning, and/or conditioning of textile surfaces.""

II. The decision mentions, among other things, the documents D2 (WO 01/90285), D3 (Data Sheet Neodol 91-8), D4 (WO 01/98447), D8 (G89-922 Stain Removal for Washable Fabrics), D9 (Tips for stain removal), and D11 (EP 1319394 A1).

III. With the statement of grounds for appeal, the appellants submitted five new documents (D12-D15) and requested that the contested patent be revoked in its entirety due to lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC). They argued that the subject matter of granted claim 1 is not inventive starting from D2.

IV. In the response to the appeal, the patent proprietor and respondent submitted two auxiliary requests and requested that D12-D15 not be admitted into the proceedings. Regarding inventive step, they argued that D8 and D9 are the best starting points because they address the same problem as the contested patent, yet do not suggest the subject matter of granted claim 1.

V. Claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 corresponds to claim 1 of the main request, with the proportion of the organic and inorganic acid restricted to between 5 and 30 wt.%, and between 0.5 and 10 wt.%, respectively, based on the total treatment agent.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 corresponds to claim 1 of the first auxiliary request, with the proportion of the non-ionic surfactant restricted to between 0.5 and 20 wt.% and the proportion of the deodorizing compound restricted to between 0.01 and 5 wt.%, respectively, based on the total treatment agent.

VI. Following the receipt of the preliminary opinion of the board, the appellants requested that the auxiliary requests not be admitted into the proceedings due to insufficient substantiation, or at least that any related arguments from the respondent be rejected as late. They further argued that the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary requests 1 and 2 is not inventive starting from D2 and considering the teaching of D4.

VII. In response, the respondent argued that the auxiliary requests are admissible and requested that the appellants' request for non-admission of the auxiliary requests due to lateness not be allowed. Furthermore, they argued that the subject matter of claim 1 of the first and second auxiliary requests is not obvious, as neither D2 nor D4 provides the skilled person with a hint regarding the defined contents of organic and inorganic acid, or surfactant and deodorizing compound in the respective requests.

VIII. On May 15, 2023, an oral hearing took place before the board in the absence of the respondent. The final requests of the parties were as follows:

The appellants (opponents) requested primarily that the contested decision be overturned and the European patent be revoked.

The respondent (patent proprietor) requested primarily in writing that the appeal be dismissed, alternatively the maintenance of the patent in amended form, based on one of the auxiliary requests 1 or 2, submitted with the response to the appeal.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Main Request

In the communication under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020, the Board explained that and why the subject matter of claim 1 does not involve an inventive step. Since the respondent did not present any counterarguments in this regard, the Board confirmed this conclusion.

1.1 The invention relates to the use of a textile treatment agent in washing, cleaning, and/or conditioning (paragraph 0001, claim 1).

1.2 D2 (title) relates to fabric softeners. A fabric softener is a textile conditioner within the meaning of claim 1, making D2 a suitable starting point for assessing inventive step. Specifically, the fabric softener composition 4 from example 1 contains, among other things, an organic acid (""fatty acid""), an inorganic acid (HCl), a nonionic surfactant (Neodol 91-8, see D3), and a deodorizing compound (cyclodextrin, see granted claim 5 of the patent in dispute). However, the pH value of this specific composition is not disclosed.

1.3 The respondent did not consider D2 to be the closest prior art and argued solely based on D8 or D9, and the opposition division also believed that D2 did not represent the closest prior art. Both justified this by stating that the closest prior art must be directed towards a similar effect as the patent in dispute (subjective problem), which consists of removing crusts and discolorations resulting from contact with deodorant (paragraph 0008). In light of this subjective problem, the opposition division concluded that the claimed textile treatment must take place either during or before a washing process. In contrast, D2 discloses fabric softeners that can only exert their effect when applied after the washing process, thus excluding the effects of D2 and the patent in dispute.

1.4 However, the argument regarding D2 is not convincing, as claim 1 encompasses different embodiments, namely both the use of a textile treatment agent in cleaning or washing and the use of the agent in conditioning textile surfaces. It is evident that for these different uses, different documents may qualify as the closest prior art. While for the cleaning embodiments, D8 or D9 certainly represent a suitable and possibly better starting point than D2, this does not apply to the embodiment of use in conditioning. Rather, a document like D2, which discloses textile conditioners and their use, is particularly relevant. It follows that D2 can be considered as a possible document for the closest prior art.

1.5 As mentioned above, the patent in dispute aims to reduce crusts and discolorations. The respondent claimed that this is evidenced by the examples in the patent.

While these examples and the effect possibly shown therein may be relevant for the aforementioned embodiments of use in cleaning, they are irrelevant for the embodiment of use in conditioning. Conditioning and cleaning are generally understood to be different processes, and the patent in dispute contains no data indicating that the claimed textile treatment agent would provide any advantages in conditioning compared to D2. Thus, for this embodiment, the task is merely to provide an additional use in conditioning textiles.

1.6 To solve this task, the patent in dispute proposes adjusting the pH of the textile treatment agent to between 1.5 and 5.5.

1.7 However, this solution and thus the subject matter of claim 1 is obvious, as D2 teaches in the bridging paragraph between pages 44 and 45 to preferably adjust the pH to a value between 2.5 and 3.5. It is therefore obvious for the skilled person to apply this teaching to composition 4 of example 1 of D2, leading them to the subject matter of claim 1 without having to engage in inventive activity. The ground for opposition under Article 100(a), 56 EPC therefore precludes the maintenance of the patent in dispute, which is why the main request cannot be granted.

2. Admission of Auxiliary Requests 1 and 2

2.1 As the respondent has pointed out, the auxiliary requests were already submitted during the opposition proceedings, and therefore, according to Article 12(4) RPBA 2020, they are not to be considered as amendments. However, non-admission of the auxiliary requests may be considered due to insufficient substantiation according to Article 12(3) and (5) RPBA 2020.

In this case, it can remain undecided whether the respondent's additional explanations for substantiation in their submission of May 12, 2023, should be taken into account according to Article 13(2) RPBA 2020, as the Board has, regardless of this additional presentation, exercised its discretion not to exclude the auxiliary requests under Article 12(3) and (5) RPBA 2020.

Article 12(3) RPBA 2020 states that the statement of grounds of appeal or the reply must contain the complete appeal submissions of a party and must clearly and concisely indicate the reasons for requesting that the contested decision be overturned, amended, or upheld.

The requirements set out in Article 12(3)(5) RPBA 2020 are to be examined ex officio, which makes the respondent's request for non-admission of the appellants' non-admission request irrelevant for the Board's decision.

From Article 12(3) RPBA 2020, it follows that a patent proprietor must substantiate auxiliary requests to be considered in the appeal proceedings. They must therefore explain in particular why the amendments made are suitable to address the objections raised (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 10th edition, V.A.4.3.5.b)(i)). Thus, a patent proprietor presenting new auxiliary requests to counter attacks under Article 54 or 56 EPC generally has to at least indicate which features serve to distinguish over which prior art. Depending on the specific circumstances of the case, particularly also depending on the level of detail of the substantiation of the respective ground for opposition on one hand and the complexity of the amended features in the auxiliary requests on the other hand, more specific explanations from the patent proprietor may be necessary.

Regarding the objections under Article 54 and 56 EPC, the respondent has made no statements concerning the auxiliary requests, so that in this case, there is a lack of substantiation in the sense of Article 12(3) RPBA 2020.

However, this lack of substantiation does not directly imply that the requests are not to be admitted. Rather, the admission under Article 12(5) RPBA 2020 is at the discretion of the Board. Articles 12(3) as well as Articles 12(4), 13(1), and 13(2) RPBA 2020 aim, among other things, to ensure that relevant requests, evidence, and arguments are introduced into the proceedings as early as possible, so that the other party and the Board can engage with the complete submissions as soon as possible to ensure effective and straightforward procedural management. Thus, the question of the extent to which a lack or incompleteness of substantiation contradicts this goal can be taken into account in the exercise of discretion under Article 12(5) RPBA 2020.

In this regard, the appellants have argued that it is a disadvantage for them not to know what the respondent intends with the amendments made.

However, this argument does not convince in the present case. In their statement of grounds of appeal, the appellants raised objections against the main request only under Article 54 (D2 and D11) and 56 EPC (based on D2, the skilled knowledge evidenced by D8 and D9, and D15).

Claim 1 of the first and second auxiliary requests has, compared to the main request, relatively simple additional limitations that are clearly aimed at distinguishing from the prior art in the proceedings. Although the respondent did not explicitly argue this, it is immediately apparent that the passages cited by the appellants as detrimental to novelty in D2 (composition 4 on page 54; this also applies considering D7) and D11 (claim 1, [0034], [0038]) do not disclose these limitations. It is also prima facie evident that the limitations further distinguish the claimed subject matter from documents D8 and D9, which the respondent considers to be the closest prior art. For example, neither D8 nor D9 disclose the use of inorganic acids and thus do not disclose the use of the now claimed content thereof.

In this situation, it is not apparent that the appellants have suffered a disadvantage due to the lack of substantiation, especially since the substantiation obligation set out in Article 12(3) RPBA 2020 does not mean that the burden of proof for lack of novelty or for the absence of inventive step shifts to the patent proprietor. This burden remains with the opponent.

In light of this, the Board does not find it appropriate, under the given circumstances, to exercise its discretion to exclude auxiliary requests 1 and 2 from the proceedings.

2.2 The Board has exercised its discretion under Article 13(2) RPBA 2020 to admit the new submissions of the appellants in their submission of March 16, 2022, particularly the objection based on D2 and D4 and the submissions in the appellants' submission of May 4, 2023.

The appellants attacked the auxiliary requests submitted by the respondent with the response to the appeal on March 1, 2021, for the first time two years later, with the submission of March 16, 2023, and thus after the summons to the oral proceedings. The admission of the submissions is therefore governed by Article 13(2) RPBA.

In this case, there are exceptional circumstances because the appellants have responded to the Board's statements in the Board's communication of November 24, 2022, with the new submissions. In this communication, the Board assessed the respondent's auxiliary requests on a prima facie basis. Since this assessment occurred despite the respondent not having sufficiently substantiated their auxiliary requests by that time, it is appropriate in this case to allow the appellants the opportunity to respond to this assessment of the Board with an objection based on the prior art already in the proceedings.

Additionally, the appellants had already attacked the auxiliary requests at first instance (submission of December 17, 2019). Although this first-instance submission is not part of the appeal proceedings (Article 12(1) RPBA 2020), the Board has taken into account in exercising its discretion that particularly the attack based on D2 with D4 (see below) could not surprise the respondent with the associated arguments.

3. Auxiliary Request 1 - Article 56 EPC

The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 is obvious to the skilled person starting from D2 and considering the teaching of D4.

3.1.1 Compared to the main request, this request has two further distinguishing features from D2, namely the content of organic and inorganic acid. Composition 4 of D2 contains only 0.28 wt.% HCl (inorganic acid) and only 0.75 wt.% fatty acid as organic acid.

3.1.2 A technical effect resulting from these features was not claimed by the respondent and is also not apparent. Thus, the task can also be formulated as providing an additional option for conditioning textiles.

3.1.3 To solve this task, the patent in dispute proposes the use of a textile treatment agent containing between 5 and 30 wt.% organic acid and between 0.5 and 10 wt.% inorganic acid. However, this solution is also obvious considering the teaching of D4. This also applies considering the submissions of the respondent in their submission of May 12, 2023, so that a decision on the admission of this submission is unnecessary.

3.1.4 D4 also discloses textile treatment agents that are used in post-treatment of washed textiles, i.e., in conditioning. Thus, the skilled person would consider document D4 in solving the task. The respondent did not dispute this but merely argued that even considering D4, the claimed subject matter is not suggested because the skilled person does not receive any indication from this document to use organic acid in an amount between 5 and 30 wt.% and inorganic acid in an amount between 0.5 and 10 wt.%.

3.1.5 However, this is not agreed upon, as D4 discloses on page 11, line 27 - page 12, line 11, that by adding a suitable amount of acid in the range of between 0.5 and 10 wt.%, among other things, an improvement in the softness of the laundry can be achieved. Since the skilled person starts from a fabric softener (D2), they would particularly consider this teaching. In the aforementioned passage, D4 also suggests using mixtures of inorganic and organic acids. This is also compatible with the teaching of D2, which also suggests using mixtures of various organic and inorganic acids for pH adjustment (bottom of page 44). In this context, it would be obvious to use, for example, a mixture of citric acid, which is preferred according to D2 and D4, and HCl, which is already present in the starting composition 4. Neither D2 nor D4 disclose the exact proportions of inorganic and organic acid in such a mixture, but in the absence of any particular effect, the claimed ranges seem to be arbitrarily selected. Such an arbitrary selection does not involve an inventive step in the sense of Article 56 EPC.

4. Auxiliary Request 2 - Article 56 EPC

The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 also does not involve an inventive step. This also applies considering the submissions of the respondent in their submission of May 12, 2023, so that a decision on its admission due to lateness is unnecessary. There, the respondent merely argued that the skilled person does not receive any indication from D4 regarding the amounts for the nonionic surfactant and the deodorizing compound.

However, the respondent overlooks that the two additional features are already disclosed in composition 4 of example 1 of D2, as it contains 3.5 wt.% of a nonionic surfactant (Neodol 91-8, see D3) and 0.3 wt.% of a deodorizing compound (cyclodextrin, see in the patent in dispute [0013]).

5. Thus, the subject matter of claim 1 of the second auxiliary request also does not involve an inventive step.

6. Since the above reasoning of the Board does not rely on the late-filed documents D12-D15, there is no need to decide on the respondent's request not to admit these documents.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1.

I. The appeal is directed against the short communication of the opposition division dated October 14, 2020, which rejected a request from the appellant (opponent 5) to postpone the oral proceedings scheduled for April 20 and 21, 2021.

II. A total of five oppositions were filed against the patent EP 3 093 009 granted on April 24, 2019.

III. During the opposition proceedings, the opposition division issued a summons on September 29, 2020, for oral proceedings to be held on April 20 and 21, 2021, in Munich.

IV. In a letter dated October 2, 2020 (received on October 5, 2020), the appellant requested that the hearing scheduled for April 20 and 21, 2021, in Munich be postponed and a new date be set. The representative had already been summoned for an oral hearing in Rijswijk on April 22, 2021.

V. In the short communication from the opposition division dated October 14, 2020, the aforementioned facts were briefly summarized, and the request was rejected as follows:

The guidelines state that in opposition proceedings, especially with more than one opponent, a stricter approach may be taken to prevent dates from being postponed multiple times (see T1102/03) (Guidelines, E-7.1).

Considering the parties (patent owner and 5 opponents), the complexity of the case, and the organizational effort, a postponement cannot be agreed upon, particularly in the interest of legal certainty.

The request of opponent 5 is therefore rejected.

VI. In a letter dated November 6, 2020, the appellant (opponent 5) filed an appeal against this short communication. The reasoning was submitted with the same letter; the appeal fee was also paid on November 6, 2020.

VII. The appellant requested the annulment of the contested decision (i.e., the short communication of October 14, 2020) and, in particular, the referral of the matter back to the opposition division with the instruction to set a new date for the oral proceedings. The appellant also requested the reimbursement of the appeal fee, expedited handling of the appeal, and (in the alternative) the scheduling of an oral hearing via videoconference. The arguments justifying the appeal will be addressed below in the reasons for the decision, as far as they are relevant to the decision.

VIII. In an effort to reach a decision on the appeal, if possible, before the date for the oral proceedings before the opposition division (April 20/21, 2021), the parties were summoned for an oral hearing on March 8, 2021. This date was postponed to March 10, 2021, at the request of the appellant.

IX. In a communication dated February 15, 2021, the chamber explained its preliminary view on why the appeal was inadmissible. This communication also noted that due to the timing circumstances, it was not possible to set the other parties the prescribed four-month period for their responses to the appeal reasoning and that the subject of the oral proceedings must therefore be limited to the admissibility of the appeal. Should the chamber be of the opinion after the oral proceedings that the appeal cannot be immediately dismissed as inadmissible, deadlines would be set for the other parties to submit their responses.

X. The appellant responded to this communication with a letter dated February 23, 2021.

XI. The oral proceedings took place on March 10, 2021, as a videoconference. No other parties were represented besides the appellant. The decision was announced at the end of the oral proceedings.

XII. The other procedural participants (patent owner and opponents 1 to 4) did not submit any requests in the written proceedings.

XIII. The appellant maintained the requests made in the appeal reasoning (above point VII) during the oral proceedings.

XIV. In the event that an oral hearing before the opposition division should take place before a decision is made in the present appeal case, the appellant further requested that the repetition of the oral proceedings with a different composition of the opposition division be ordered.","Reasons for the Decision

1. With regard to the admissibility of the appeal, the formal requirements for the timely submission and payment of the appeal fee are met (see Facts and Requests, Point VI).

2. The admissibility of the appeal depends on whether the contested short communication of October 14, 2020, constitutes an appealable decision within the meaning of Article 106 EPC. Article 106(2) EPC, which essentially corresponds to Article 106(3) EPC 1973, states:

A decision that does not conclude proceedings against a party is only appealable together with the final decision, unless the decision allows for a separate appeal.

The admission of a separate appeal against an interim decision within the meaning of Article 106(2) EPC by the first-instance body is a prerequisite for the admissibility of the appeal (Rule 101(1) EPC; J 8/11, No. 1 of the Reasons for the Decision). The admission of a separate appeal is a constitutive decision of the first-instance body that establishes the appealability in the appeal process and must therefore be included in the operative part of the first-instance decision (see T 756/14, No. 9 of the Reasons for the Decision and guiding principle).

3. The appellant did not assert that the proceedings against her were concluded by the contested short communication. However, she was of the opinion that the opposition division should have allowed the separate appeal within the meaning of Article 106(2) EPC.

4. There is no doubt that the opposition division did not allow a separate appeal against the short communication. The argument that the opposition division should have allowed a separate appeal implies that a (implicit or explicit) decision by an examining or opposition division not to allow a separate appeal is subject to substantive review.

5. For the substantive reviewability of the non-admission of a separate appeal, the appellant particularly relied on T 1954/14 (see her letter of February 23, 2021). In this decision, the board recognized, referring to the travaux préparatoires, that the decision on the admission of a separate appeal against interim decisions is at the discretion of the deciding body (No. 1.3.1 of the Reasons for the Decision; see also T 1849/12, No. 2.2.1 of the Reasons for the Decision). The board concluded in decision T 1954/14 that in the case before it, the non-admission of the separate appeal against an interim decision regarding the taking of evidence by the opposition division was not tainted by errors of discretion.

6. In decision T 1849/12, which the appellant primarily referred to regarding the appeal, the board found that the examining division had not correctly exercised its discretion in deciding on the requested admission of a separate appeal against the decision to promptly send a communication under Rule 71(3) EPC, as it had not sufficiently considered that the rejected request to enable a timely grant of the patent through the prompt sending of a communication under Rule 71(3) EPC could no longer be meaningfully addressed in the event of a successful appeal after the final decision on the grant (No. 2.2.2 of the Reasons for the Decision).

7. Whether the non-admission of a separate appeal under Article 106(2) EPC constitutes a reviewable discretionary decision in every case, or whether the admission of the separate appeal by the first-instance body is an objective prerequisite for admissibility that depends solely on that body, can ultimately remain open. In any case, the first-instance body is not obliged to justify in every interim decision why a separate appeal is not allowed against it.

8. The board dealing with case T 1849/12 viewed the refusal to promptly send a communication under Rule 71(3) EPC as a final and legally binding determination regarding the appellant's request, particularly concerning the granting of rights under Article 64 EPC associated with the timely grant of the patent, which has the character of a decision within the meaning of Article 106(1) EPC. This results in a grievance for the appellant (No. 2.1.3 of the Reasons for the Decision).

9. In the present case, the appellant cannot rely on such a grievance. The contested interim decision regarding the refusal of a request for postponement cannot interfere with substantive legal positions but only has consequences for the proceedings. Any additional inconveniences and expenses that may arise cannot constitute a grievance relevant to the admissibility of an appeal.

10. The appellant stated in her letter of February 23, 2021, what developments the proceedings could take if the question of postponing the oral proceedings from April 20/21, 2021, could only be contested with the final decision: The appellant would be de facto forced to appoint another representative to represent her interests at the (not postponed) oral proceedings (Point 6 of the mentioned letter).

11. The board is not convinced by the appellant's argument that this would create an irremediable disadvantage in the sense of an uncorrectable first impression in the context of the not postponed oral proceedings for her. The possible repetition of the oral proceedings after the approval of an appeal against the final decision is a normal measure in the context of the repetition of procedural steps, as is regularly required when a case is referred back to the first instance after a successful appeal. It can be expected that the examiners involved in the repetition of a procedural step will be unaffected by the first execution of the same procedural step. Should a suspicion arise that an examiner might be biased in the repetition of a procedural step in which they were involved during the initial execution, appropriate objections should be raised before or during the repetition of the procedural step (analogous to Article 24 EPC, see G 5/91, OJ EPO 1992, 617).

12. For these reasons, the contested short communication is not an interim decision against which a separate appeal should have been allowed. The present appeal therefore does not comply with Article 106(2) EPC and is to be dismissed as inadmissible in accordance with Rule 101(1) EPC.

13. The assessment of the admissibility of the appeal must be made regardless of whether the contested interim decision is fraught with serious deficiencies or even, as claimed by the appellant, is arbitrary. Even such a seriously deficient decision could only be overturned if there is a permissible appeal (see T 823/99, No. 1.3 of the Reasons for the Decision). Therefore, the alleged deficiencies of the contested interim decision or short communication and their justification (see Facts and Requests, Point V) will not be addressed.

Regarding the further procedural requests of the appellant

14. The requested refund of the appeal fee due to a substantial procedural defect (Rule 103(1)(a) EPC) would only be possible if the appeal were granted. This condition is not met if the appeal is inadmissible (see T 823/99, No. 2 of the Reasons for the Decision).

15. The procedural request made during the oral proceedings regarding the reappointment of the opposition division (Facts and Requests, Point XIV) would also only be assessed in the presence of an admissible appeal, and it is already moot for the reason that the condition set by the appellant (oral proceedings before the opposition division before the decision in this appeal procedure) has not occurred.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1.

I. The appeal of the appellant (opponent) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to reject its opposition under Article 101(2) EPC.

II. The opposition division did not consider the grounds for opposition raised under Article 100(a)(b) EPC regarding lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC), lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC), and lack of sufficiency of disclosure (Article 83 EPC) as obstacles to the maintenance of the patent.

III. The following documents are referred to in the present decision:

IV. The independent claim 1 of the patent reads as follows:

""Cosmetic or dermatological preparation comprising glyceryl caprylate and dehydracetic acid and/or sodium dehydroacetate characterized in that the preparation is free from parabens, benzyl alcohol, formaldehyde, phenoxyethanol, ethylene glycol monophenyl ether, phenyl glycol, benzethonium chloride, lauroylethylarginine, octopirox, and methylisothiazolinone, contains less than 0.1 wt.% ethanol, and has a pH in the range of 5.5 to 7.5.""

Dependent claim 4 has the following wording:

""Preparation according to one of the preceding claims, comprising, in addition to glyceryl caprylate and dehydracetic acid and/or sodium dehydroacetate, only natural substances, natural, nature-like, and/or nature-identical raw materials.""

V. In her statement of grounds of appeal, and in the further course of the appeal proceedings, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

The claimed cosmetic or dermatological preparations are not sufficiently disclosed, Article 100(b) and 83 EPC. In particular, the nature-like raw materials defined in claim 4 are not accessible to the skilled person.

The claimed compositions are not novel over D1, as already argued in the opposition proceedings, Article 100(a) and 54 EPC.

The claimed compositions are suggested to the skilled person starting from D2 in combination with D3, Article 100(a) and 56 EPC. The compositions defined in the patent claims differ from those of D2 only in the presence of dehydracetic acid. The inadequate preservation of the compositions disclosed in D2 against yeast and mold infestation is evident from the illustrations. It would therefore have been obvious for the skilled person to add a preservative effective against these microbes, in particular dehydracetic acid, to improve preservation.

VI. In her response to the appeal, and in the further course of the appeal proceedings, the respondent (patent holder) essentially argued as follows:

The claimed compositions are described in a manner understandable to the skilled person. Nature-like raw materials are known to the skilled person.

The claimed compositions were by no means suggested to the skilled person starting from D2. It is not clear which of the compositions disclosed in D2 are inadequately preserved against yeast and mold infestation. Additionally, the claimed compositions are also skin-friendly, particularly for use around the eyes. Regarding this aspect, at least, the use of dehydracetic acid is not suggested to the skilled person by the prior art.

VII. By summons dated April 26, 2022, an oral hearing was scheduled for March 21, 2023. In a procedural order under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020, the board informed the parties that it considered the grounds for opposition of lack of sufficiency of disclosure and lack of novelty as not conclusive. Inventive step would need to be discussed at the hearing.

VIII. The oral hearing took place on March 21, 2023.

IX. The final requests of the parties were as follows:

The appellant (opponent) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

The respondent (patent holder) requested the dismissal of the appeal, alternatively the maintenance of the patent in amended form based on one of auxiliary requests 1 to 4 submitted in the opposition proceedings.

X. At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. Sufficiency of Disclosure, Article 100(c) and Article 83 EPC

2.1 The appellant's objection concerns the term ""natural-like raw materials"" in claim 4. A skilled person could not derive from the patent or general technical knowledge what compounds are meant by this term. According to paragraph [0049] of the patent, such substances are chemically modified in an undefined manner compared to the natural starting materials. There is also no example that uses such raw materials.

2.2 This objection is not convincing.

A definition of this feature can be found in paragraph [0002] of the patent as a chemically modified natural raw material, where the chemical modifications have a model in nature, such as saponification or esterification. Such substances are known or can be obtained through standard reactions. This includes, for example, glycerin, which is known to occur esterified in natural fats and is also used in the examples of the patent. Furthermore, as emphasized by the respondent, the example preparation A in paragraph [0044] also contains such substances, such as cetylstearyl alcohol or glyceryl stearate. A skilled person is therefore quite capable of identifying such compounds.

Moreover, the appellant's arguments, even if they were correct, relate to the clarity of the claims under Article 84 EPC and cannot be raised against the granted patent under Article 100 EPC. It may be that in individual cases it is not clear whether a specific ingredient that a skilled person could use to produce the claimed compositions can be considered a ""natural-like raw material"" or not. However, this does not lead to the conclusion that a skilled person is unable to produce the claimed compositions possibly using other starting materials.

3. Novelty, Article 100(a) and Article 54 EPC

The appellant referred only to its submissions in the opposition proceedings. However, these submissions were already considered in the contested decision. The appellant has not presented any arguments in the appeal proceedings as to why the decision of the opposition division regarding novelty should be deemed erroneous. The Board therefore sees no reason to question the decision of the opposition division in this regard.

4. Inventive Step, Article 100(a) and Article 56 EPC

4.1 The patent deals with natural cosmetics. In particular, it addresses the issue of their sufficient preservation, as the use of classical preservatives is to be avoided.

4.2 Closest Prior Art

D2 undisputedly represents the closest prior art. D2 is a product information sheet for the composition ""dermosoft® GMCY,"" which notably contains glyceryl caprylate. The antimicrobial activity of glyceryl caprylate is highlighted. On page 2, it is stated that in combination with other dermosoft® products, often no further preservation is necessary. Page 3 also describes that in most cases, conventional preservatives can be omitted.

The appellant specifically cited the ""Natural Body Spray"" on page 6 of D2.

4.3 Difference of the Claims from the Closest Prior Art

The present claims differ from D2 in that they additionally require dehydracetic acid or its sodium salt as an ingredient. The other features of the characterizing part of claim 1 of the patent, which relate to the absence of common preservatives and the pH value to be maintained, are fulfilled in D2.

This was also undisputed.

4.4 Problem and Solution

4.4.1 The combination of glyceryl caprylate and dehydracetic acid in the claimed products leads to compositions with good skin compatibility, particularly for use around the eyes, and to sufficient preservation. This is detailed in paragraphs [0035] and [0043] of the patent and is evidenced by the tests in paragraph [0044].

The appellant argued that the test results of the patent did not show an improvement in skin compatibility compared to D2. Furthermore, the occurrence of intolerances in 5% of the subjects, as in preparation B in paragraph [0044], is not evidence that the product is skin-compatible.

The Board agrees that no improvement in skin compatibility compared to D2 was demonstrated. However, at least the skin compatibility of the claimed products has been proven, particularly for use around the eyes, see paragraph [0044], composition A. The appellant did not substantiate that an intolerance rate of 5% in the stinging test of composition B according to paragraph [0044] would generally be considered unacceptable.

The Board therefore concludes that the compositions defined in the claim are skin-compatible, particularly for use around the eyes, and exhibit sufficient preservation.

4.4.2 Starting from D2, the technical problem to be solved was therefore to provide compositions that exhibit sufficient preservation and are particularly compatible for use around the eyes.

This objective is already mentioned in the patent itself, see paragraphs [0008] and [0022].

4.4.3 This problem is solved by the claimed compositions, which are distinguished from D2 by the presence of dehydracetic acid or its salts, as outlined above.

4.4.4 The appellant has argued that no evidence of preservation is provided in the patent, and that the skin compatibility of the claimed products is not demonstrated across the full breadth of the claim.

This assertion is not convincing. The addition of the known (see D3) preservative dehydracetic acid to the compositions of D2 leading to products that do not exhibit sufficient preservation compared to those of D2 is technically implausible. Furthermore, the appellant itself demonstrated with the comparative test submitted with the appeal that the preservative effect is improved with the addition of dehydracetic acid compared to the preparations of D2, particularly regarding contamination with molds and yeasts.

Regarding skin compatibility, the Board sees no reason to doubt the statements made in the patent in paragraphs [0035], [0043], and [0044] in the absence of counterexamples. The mere assertion that the claims could also encompass compositions for which the statements made do not apply is not sufficient.

4.5 Obviousness of the Solution

The parties particularly disputed whether the above-defined technical problem was solved in an obvious manner for the skilled person.

In the contested decision, this question was answered in the negative, see point 11 of the reasoning.

This assessment is to be agreed with, as will be justified below.

4.5.1 The appellant argued that a skilled person would have inferred from D2 that the composition ""Natural Body Spray"" described on page 6 is particularly susceptible to contamination with molds and yeasts. This is evident from Figure 2. The addition of dehydracetic acid, a compound known for such purposes from D3, a handbook for preservatives, would therefore have been obvious. For the known properties of dehydracetic acid, the appellant particularly referred to the ""Effect"" section on page 43 of D3. The skilled person would also not be deterred from adding it by the statement in D3 that dehydracetic acid is incompatible with non-ionic surfactants, as the claims are not restricted to formulations containing such surfactants. Moreover, dehydracetic acid is listed in Table 1 of the contested patent as a natural cosmetic raw material, which further supports its use.

4.5.2 The Board finds this argument unconvincing.

First, the respondent argued, and the Board agrees, that it is not clear from D2 whether the Figure 2 referred to by the appellant belongs to the ""natural body spray"" described on page 6. D2 describes four different compositions on pages 6-9. There are also four different figures shown on pages 4 and 5. However, the products named in Figures 1, 3, and 4, ""Deo Roll On liquid,"" ""W/O lotion,"" and ""O/W cream,"" do not correspond to any of the compositions described on pages 6-9. It cannot therefore be assumed that Figure 2 describes the behavior of the ""natural body spray"" on page 6 or indeed any composition corresponding to the patent claims apart from the presence of dehydracetic acid. The respondent pointed out that, for example, the skin cream described on page 9 has a non-claim-compliant pH value and that the ""natural body spray"" itself contains an undefined amount of alcohol.

However, even if one were to assume in favor of the appellant that the skilled person would have inferred from D2 that glyceryl caprylate alone is insufficient for the preservation of the compositions against yeasts and molds, the skilled person would not have been led to use dehydracetic acid to solve the stated problem based on D3.

The skilled person receives no indication from D3 regarding the skin compatibility of the compositions, which is also required by the technical problem to be solved and is demonstrated in the patent, particularly for those intended for use around the eyes.

The skilled person would therefore have had no incentive to select dehydracetic acid from the multitude of available preservatives if they considered the preservation of the products described in D2 to be insufficient. The fact that dehydracetic acid was known as a preservative in itself is not sufficient.

4.6 Therefore, the claimed compositions involve an inventive step over the cited documents.

5. The decision of the opposition division to reject the opposition under Article 101(2) EPC, as none of the cited grounds for opposition preclude the maintenance of the patent, is therefore not to be criticized.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",opposition rejected,opposition rejected,appeal dismissed,Fa.

I. The appeal of the opponent is directed against the decision of the opposition division to maintain European Patent EP 2 034 949 in amended form under Article 101(3) a) EPC.

II. In the opposition proceedings, the contested patent was challenged on the basis of Article 100 a) EPC for lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC), as well as under Article 100 b) EPC for lack of sufficiency of disclosure.

III. During the opposition proceedings, reference was made to the following documents, which are also relevant for the present proceedings:

D8: DE 101 43 962 A1

D9: WO 03/039507 A1

D16: Comparison UV-20-077-5-5 with UV-20-077-5-6

D17: Comparison UV-20-077-1-3 with UV-20-077-1-4

D18: Comparison UV-20-077-2-2 with UV-20-077-2-3

D19: Comparison UV-20-077-3-1 with UV-20-077-4-1

IV. The opposition division considered the invention claimed in the contested patent to be sufficiently disclosed and therefore did not find the ground for opposition under Article 100 b) EPC to be conclusive. However, the claimed subject matter was not novel in view of the disclosures of documents D5, D6, D7, and D8 (Article 54 EPC).

The auxiliary requests 1 and 2 submitted to the opposition division did not, in their view, meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

The auxiliary request 3 submitted to them met the requirements of Articles 123(2) and (3), 83 and 84 EPC. The claimed subject matter was also novel in view of the disclosures of documents D5 to D8 (Article 54 EPC). An objection of lack of novelty against the disclosure of document D9, newly raised by the opponent during the oral proceedings, was not admitted into the proceedings by the opposition division due to lack of prima facie relevance. The opposition division also considered the subject matter of auxiliary request 3 to be based on an inventive step, starting from the disclosure of document D9, and particularly taking into account the experimental data of document D16 (Article 56 EPC).

V. In support of their appeal, the opponent argued that contrary to the view of the opposition division, the maintained auxiliary request 3 had been amended in an inadmissible manner (Article 123(2) EPC), that the claimed invention was not disclosed in a manner sufficient for it to be carried out (Article 83 EPC), and that the claimed subject matter did not involve an inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

VI. In their response to the statement of grounds of appeal, the respondent (patent proprietor) submitted auxiliary requests 1 and 2.

VII. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the board informed the parties of its preliminary opinion regarding the factual and legal situation. It informed the parties that the main request of the respondent, on the basis of which the contested patent was maintained in the opposition proceedings (auxiliary request 3 of the opposition proceedings), provisionally fulfilled the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, and that the claimed subject matter was disclosed in a manner sufficient for it to be carried out (Article 83 EPC). The parties were also informed that the question of inventive step would need to be discussed during the oral proceedings, particularly starting from the disclosure of document D9 and the experimental data in documents D16 to D18.

VIII. The main request relevant for the present proceedings contains three claims, which have the following wording:

""1. A method for increasing the sun protection factor of a cosmetic and/or dermatological preparation containing at least one UV-B filter selected from ethylhexyl triazone and diethylhexyl butamido triazone, and optionally UV broadband filters, by adding a UV-A filter during the preparation of the formulation, characterized in that in the finished cosmetic and/or dermatological preparation, a value for the ratio of the sum of the mass of the UV-A filters to the sum of the mass of the UV-B filters and broadband filters is set to be between 1 and 6, characterized in that 2-(4-diethylamino-2-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid hexyl ester is used as the sole UV-A filter.""

""2. Use of the UV-A filter 2-(4-diethylamino-2-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid hexyl ester for increasing the sun protection factor of a cosmetic and/or dermatological preparation containing at least one UV-B filter selected from ethylhexyl triazone and diethylhexyl butamido triazone, and optionally UV broadband filters, characterized in that in the finished cosmetic and/or dermatological preparation, the value for the ratio of the UV-A filter to the sum of the mass of the UV-B filters and broadband filters is between 1 and 6, characterized in that the preparation contains 2-(4-diethylamino-2-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid hexyl ester as the sole UV-A filter.""

""3. Sun protection effective cosmetic and/or dermatological preparation, containing as the sole UV-A filter 2-(4-diethylamino-2-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid hexyl ester and at least one UV-B filter selected from ethylhexyl triazone and diethylhexyl butamido triazone, as well as optionally further cosmetic active, auxiliary, and additive substances, wherein the value for the ratio of the sum of the mass of the UV-A filters to the sum of the mass of the UV-B filters is between 1 and 8, and the preparation does not contain a broadband filter.""

IX. In its statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

The originally filed application documents do not disclose a method that exhibits the combination of the feature ""... UV-B filter selected from ethylhexyl triazone and diethylhexyl butamido triazone ..."" with the feature ""... that in the finished cosmetic and/or dermatological preparation, a value for the ratio of the sum of the mass of the UV-A filters to the sum of the mass of the UV-B filters and broadband filters is set to be between 1 and 6"" in the case where the preparation does not contain broadband filters. Claim 1 of the main request now requires the specified ratio even in the absence of a broadband filter. In particular, there is no basis for this combination on page 13, lines 38 to 41 of the original description, as only compositions that also included broadband filters are disclosed there. On page 18, lines 21 to 23, although there is a disclosure for compositions without broadband filters, the value for a mass ratio of ""1 to 6"" is not disclosed at this point.

Sufficiency of Disclosure (Article 83 EPC):

According to paragraph [0031] of the description of the contested patent, an increase in the sun protection factor (SPF) is only considered inventive if this increase amounts to at least 1 to 3 SPF units. However, the examples of the contested patent show that such an increase does not occur across the entire claimed range. The appellant also referred to the experimental data already submitted by them in the opposition proceedings with their letter of June 19, 2020.

The appellant further argued that the addition of the UV-A filter does not lead to an increase according to paragraph [0031] of the description, especially when UV-A filters are already present in the preparation. For instance, the comparison of examples 2 and 16 as well as 4 and 12 of the contested patent shows that the addition of DHHB in certain cases even leads to a reduction in the sun protection factor. This is also evident from the test report of June 19, 2020.

Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC):

The appellant based their argumentation particularly on the fact that no technical effect had been demonstrated for the claimed subject matter that could be attributed to the distinguishing features over document D9 as the closest prior art. The experimental data cited by the respondent from documents D16 to D19 were not considered conclusive. Therefore, the objective technical problem could only be seen as providing an alternative. Even if a technical effect were to be acknowledged, the claimed connection between the use of the UV-A filter DHHB and an increase in the sun protection factor of the obtained preparations was already evident from the mentioned documents.

X. The arguments of the respondent can be summarized as follows:

Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

The respondent particularly referred to page 18, lines 8 to 19 in conjunction with page 17, lines 21 to 28 of the original description. In their view, these passages provide the basis for the contested combination of features.

Sufficiency of Disclosure (Article 83 EPC)

According to the respondent, the skilled person already obtains sufficient information about the implementation of the claimed subject matter from the disclosure of the contested patent, particularly through the experimental evidence provided in Table 2. The arguments put forward by the appellant are therefore not conclusive.

Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

The respondent based their argumentation particularly on the experimental data in Table 2 of the contested patent as well as the data in documents D16 to D19. This demonstrates that either by adding a single UV-A filter, namely the compound DHHB, to a preparation containing one of the two UV-B filters EHT or DBT, or by adjusting the mass ratio of the UV filters contained in such preparations to a claimed range, an increase in the sun protection factor can be achieved. Even if documents D16 to D19 do not show a direct comparison with the examples of document D9, the results are transferable. The technical problem is seen in providing improved methods, uses, and preparations, and the claimed solutions are inventive.

Main Request - ""Auxiliary Request 3"" maintained by the Opposition Division

1. Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

1.1 Both parties limited their arguments in the oral proceedings before the Board to their written submissions.

The appellant's argument related to the combination of features concerning the selection of UV filters and their mass ratios in the final formulation in the event that the formulation does not contain a UV broad-spectrum filter.

1.2 The appellant's argument is not convincing for the following reasons:

1.2.1 The features included in the originally filed claim 1 can be found on page 18, lines 13 to 14 (the UV-A filter ""2-(4-Diethylamino-2-hydroxybenzoyl)-benzoic acid hexyl ester""), on page 18, lines 18 to 19 and page 12, lines 30 to 31 (""UV-B filters selected from Ethylhexyl Triazone and Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone""), as well as on page 17, line 28 and page 13, line 41 (the value for the mass ratio ""from 1 to 6"").

1.2.2 The claimed combination of UV-A filters and UV-B filters is derived by the skilled person from lines 8 to 19, in particular lines 13 and 14 as well as 18 to 19 of page 18. The light-protective cosmetic and/or dermatological formulation disclosed at this point as particularly preferred contains as a UV-A filter preferably in particular 2-(4-Diethylamino-2-hydroxybenzoyl)-benzoic acid hexyl ester and as a UV-B filter preferably Ethylhexyl Triazone or Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone.

1.2.3 On page 17 (lines 21 to 28), the use of UV-A filters to increase the sun protection factor of formulations containing at least one UV-B and/or a broad-spectrum filter is disclosed. In the final formulations, the ratio of the sum of the mass of the UV-A filters to the sum of the mass of the UV-B filters and broad-spectrum filters is particularly preferably in the range of 1 to 6. The skilled person will understand this disclosure such that the masses of the various filters included in the determination of the sum from 1 to 6 only consider the broad-spectrum filter if it is actually contained in the formulation. This part of the description therefore also discloses the mentioned ratio for the case where no broad-spectrum filter is included, and thus also for the above-mentioned combination of UV-A and UV-B filters disclosed on page 18.

1.2.4 The passage referred to by the appellant on page 18 (lines 21 to 23) does not contradict this. In particular, this disclosure is not to be interpreted as meaning that the mass ratio of UV-A filter to UV-B filter of a formulation not containing a broad-spectrum filter does not fall within the range of 1 to 6 specified on page 17, line 28.

1.2.5 Furthermore, none of the mentioned passages discloses the respective features only in connection with further features that were not included in the amended claim. Nor does any of the mentioned passages refer only to specific embodiments that do not contain the further features of amended claim 1.

1.3 Therefore, the main request meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, and the ground for opposition under Article 100(c) EPC is not substantiated.

2. Sufficiency of Disclosure (Article 83 EPC)

2.1 The appellant's argument related on the one hand to a minimum increase in the sun protection factor caused by the addition of a UV-A filter, and on the other hand to the fact that the sun protection factor is not increased in formulations that already contain UV-A filters.

2.2 The appellant's submissions are not convincing for the following reasons:

2.2.1 Claim 1 relates to a method for increasing the sun protection factor of a cosmetic and/or dermatological formulation. The formulation contains at least one of the two UV-B filters mentioned in the claim, Ethylhexyl Triazone (EHT) or Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone (DBT), as well as optionally a UV broad-spectrum filter. The increase in the sun protection factor of such a formulation is to be achieved by adding the UV-A filter 2-(4-Diethylamino-2-hydroxybenzoyl)-benzoic acid hexyl ester (DHHB) during its manufacture. The claimed method also requires that the final formulation has a specific ratio of the masses of the UV-A, UV-B, and possibly UV broad-spectrum filters.

2.2.2 In order to carry out the claimed method, the skilled person must be enabled by reading the contested patent and using their general technical knowledge to add the compound DHHB mentioned in the claim to a cosmetic and/or dermatological formulation that already contains at least one of the two compounds mentioned as UV-B filters, as well as possibly a UV broad-spectrum filter. They must choose the mass ratios such that in the final formulation a value for the ratio of the sum of the mass of the UV-A filters to the sum of the mass of the UV-B filters and broad-spectrum filters is set from 1 to 6.

2.2.3 The skilled person can already reproduce this method based on the wording of the claim, possibly taking into account the possible UV broad-spectrum filters indicated in paragraph [0047] of the description of the contested patent, and possibly considering the information in the examples (see paragraph [0091]). This was not disputed by the appellant.

2.2.4 Furthermore, the skilled person must achieve an increase in the sun protection factor of the formulation containing the UV-B and possibly UV broad-spectrum filters by adding the mentioned UV-A filter while considering the quantities to be obtained. This was doubted by the appellant.

2.2.5 However, the skilled person is not faced with insurmountable problems, as evidenced by the examples provided in the description (see in particular Table 2). From examples 1 to 3, the skilled person learns that an increase in the proportion of the UV-A filter DHHB (Uvinul® A Plus, Table 1, entry 2; see also paragraph [0091]) from 2.5 to 5 to 10 wt.% leads to an increase in the sun protection factor (""SPF in vivo"" in Table 2) from 10 to 20 and finally to 32. The increase in the sun protection factor is apparently caused by the addition of the UV-A filter DHHB.

2.2.6 Whether the addition of the UV-A filter must cause an increase in the sun protection factor of at least 1 to 3, as argued by the appellant with reference to paragraph [0031] of the description of the contested patent, is not relevant to the question of the sufficiency of disclosure of the claimed method, since according to claim 1, only a general increase in the sun protection factor must be achieved, but not an increase by a specific number of units.

2.2.7 The appellant also argued that a lack of sufficiency of disclosure exists particularly because the addition of a UV-A filter to a formulation that already contains one does not necessarily lead to an increase in the sun protection factor. Therefore, the claimed method is at least not executable over the entire claimed range.

2.2.8 This argument is also not convincing. It is based on the assumption that the skilled person interprets claim 1 in such a way that the sun protection factor of a formulation containing at least one of the two mentioned UV-B filters can be increased arbitrarily by the addition of DHHB. However, the skilled person will understand the claim such that the technical effect of increasing the sun protection factor by adding the UV-A filter DHHB cannot be increased arbitrarily, but that this effect occurs particularly in formulations that do not yet contain DHHB. The interpretation of the appellant cannot be derived from the description of the contested patent.

2.2.9 Therefore, the comparison of examples 4 and 12, respectively 2 and 16 of Table 2 cited by the appellant does not demonstrate a lack of sufficiency of disclosure. These comparisons merely confirm that the SPF of formulations that already contain DHHB cannot be increased arbitrarily by further addition of DHHB.

2.2.10 The appellant also based their argument on the experimental report explained in their statement of appeal, which was submitted to the Opposition Division on June 19, 2020. However, this experimental data only shows that the addition of DHHB does not cause the observed SPF to increase linearly with the amount added. A lack of sufficiency of disclosure cannot be demonstrated by this either.

2.2.11 In summary, the appellant has not convincingly demonstrated that the skilled person cannot carry out the method according to claim 1.

2.3 No additional arguments were presented by the appellant regarding independent claims 2 and 3. These claims relate to the use of DHHB to increase the sun protection factor of a specific cosmetic and/or dermatological formulation (claim 2) or to a light-protective cosmetic and/or dermatological formulation (claim 3). In both claims, the UV filters are defined as in claim 1, although the ratio of the filters according to claim 3 is from 1 to 8. This does not give rise to a new issue regarding sufficiency of disclosure.

2.4 Therefore, the main request meets the requirements of Article 83 EPC, and the ground for opposition under Article 100(b) EPC is thus not substantiated.

3. Inventive Step (Article 56 EPC)

In the opposition proceedings, the presence of an inventive step was acknowledged. The Opposition Division considered document D9 as the closest prior art. It saw a distinguishing feature either in the use of only a single UV-A filter or in the fact that the ratio of the sum of the mass of the used UV filters does not lie within the claimed range of 1 to 6. The objective technical problem was formulated by the Opposition Division as the provision of cosmetic and/or dermatological formulations with improved sun protection factor. In their view, the solution proposed in independent claims 1 to 3 is not suggested to the skilled person even considering the technical teachings of documents D5 to D8.

Claim 1

Closest Prior Art

3.1 The contested patent deals with the increase of the sun protection factor of cosmetic and/or dermatological formulations (paragraph [0001]). The contested patent specifically refers to the objective of achieving both high UV-A and high UV-B protection with as little UV filter substance as possible. To this end, the sun protection against erythema is to be increased while efficiently utilizing the light protection filter substances used, with very good UV-A protection (paragraphs [0027] and [0028]). This erythema protection is expressed as the sun protection factor (SPF), which serves as a measure of protection against UV-B radiation (paragraphs [0005] and [0030]).

3.2 Both parties argued inventive step starting from document D9 as the closest prior art. The Board agrees with this assessment. The document also relates to cosmetic and dermatological sun protection formulations and states that such formulations must provide adequate protection against both UV-B and UV-A radiation (page 2, lines 21 to 23). The formulations according to document D9 contain both UV-A and UV-B filters.

Distinguishing Features

3.3 Document D9 discloses in claim 9 the use of hydroxybenzophenones to increase the UV protection performance of triazine and/or benzotriazole-containing cosmetic and/or dermatological formulations. The document discloses formulations that contain at least one hydroxybenzophenone and at least one triazine and/or benzotriazole derivative (page 3, lines 5 to 11). As a particularly advantageous hydroxybenzophenone, the compound 2-(4'-(Diethylamino)-2'-hydroxybenzoyl)-benzoic acid hexyl ester is mentioned on page 5, lines 5 to 9, which is the UV-A filter DHHB used according to claim 1 of the present main request (see paragraph [0035] of the contested patent). Document D9 further specifies Ethylhexyl Triazone (EHT; page 5, lines 15 to 18) and Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone (DBT; page 7, line 27 to page 8, line 4) as preferred triazines. These compounds are also used in the examples of document D9 (see page 30, lines 20 to 24 as well as the tables on pages 31 to 40).

The preparations produced by the method according to claim 1 of the present main request differ from those disclosed in the examples of document D9 either in that

a) only a single UV-A filter is contained (D9: in example 1, no. 6, in addition to DHHB, the two other UV-A filters Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethan and Terephthalidene camphor sulfonic acid are used),

or in that

b) the mass ratios of the contained UV filters do not lie within the claimed range of 1 to 6 (D9: in example 2, no. 3, example 4, no. 4, example 5, no. 1 as well as example 6, no. 4 and 8, ratios less than 1 are disclosed).

There was also agreement between the parties on this point. It was also agreed that document D9 does not disclose values for the sun protection factors for any of the described formulations.

3.4 The respondent saw another distinguishing feature in that the at least one UV-B filter must be selected from EHT and DBT according to the claim. However, the formulations of the aforementioned examples from D9 also contain EHT. Therefore, there is no further distinguishing feature.

Technical Effect and Objective Technical Problem

3.5 There was disagreement between the parties regarding what technical effect is brought about by the mentioned distinguishing features a) or b).

The appellant considered neither the data of the contested patent nor those of documents D16 to D19 to be significant, as they do not allow for a direct comparison to the closest prior art. Furthermore, these data were obtained through in vitro rather than in vivo measurements. It is also evident from examples 2 and 16 as well as 4 and 12 of Table 2 of the contested patent that the addition of DBBH as the sole UV-A filter to a formulation containing UV-B filters does not necessarily lead to an increase in the sun protection factor, but rather it may even decrease. Therefore, the solved technical problem can only be seen as providing an alternative, the claimed solution of which is suggested to the skilled person from documents D9 and D8. Also with regard to the distinguishing feature of the mass ratios of the used UV filters, inventive step should be denied for the same reasons.

The respondent based their argument on the table 2 of the contested patent, in particular on the data cited in documents D16 to D19. They concluded from this that the distinguishing features lead to an increase in the sun protection factor compared to a formulation disclosed in D9. In their view, the technical problem lay in providing a method for increasing the sun protection factor.

3.6 The argument presented by the respondent is convincing for the following reasons:

3.6.1 Firstly, it is not apparent why in vitro measurements cannot be used to determine differences in the sun protection factor of various formulations, or why they should lead to different results than corresponding in vivo measurements. Furthermore, the respondent's argument is based on measurements that compare the formulations described in documents D16 to D19 with each other and are therefore comparable, regardless of whether these studies were conducted under in vivo or in vitro conditions.

3.6.2 From table 2 of the contested patent, it is evident that the addition of the sole UV-A filter DHHB (Uvinul® A Plus) to a formulation that already contains one of the UV-B filters EHT or DBT can achieve an increase in the sun protection factor. For example, this increases from 10 in example 1 to 20 and 32 in examples 2 and 3, respectively, where these examples differ only in the amount of DHHB, while the amount of EHT remains unchanged. A comparison of examples 6 and 7 also shows an increase in the sun protection factor (from 15 to 32) with an increase in the amount of DHHB from 2 to 10 while keeping the amount of the UV-B filter DBT constant, thus through the addition of DHHB. The mass ratio is within the claimed range in all examples.

3.6.3 As already explained in point 2.2.8 of this decision, the skilled person would not expect that the sun protection factor of a formulation containing EHT or DBT can be increased arbitrarily by the addition of DHHB. Since the formulations of the mentioned examples 2 and 4 already contain DHHB, a comparison of these examples with examples 16 and 12 does not generally call into question the technical effect of improving the sun protection factor.

3.6.4 Documents D16 to D19 were submitted by the respondent during the opposition proceedings, within the time limit set by the Opposition Division in their summons to the oral proceedings under Rule 116 EPC. They were admitted into the proceedings by the Opposition Division and considered in the contested decision (see points 23 and 34.4 of the contested decision). They are therefore part of the proceedings.

3.6.5 In document D16, a formulation ""UV-20-077-5-5"" is compared with a formulation ""UV-20-077-5-6"". The first formulation contains, in addition to EHT, three UV-A filters, namely DHHB (2.00 parts), Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethan (BMDBM, 1.00 parts), and Terephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid (TDCS, 1.00 parts). The second formulation contains only a single UV-A filter, namely DHHB. The amount of DHHB in the second formulation corresponds with 4.00 parts to the sum of the UV-A filters in the first. The formulation with the sole UV-A filter DHHB has a sun protection factor of 19, compared to 17 for the formulation with three UV-A filters.

3.6.6 The appellant argued that the observed improvement in the sun protection factor could be attributed to the fact that the UV-A filter DHHB provides better sun protection compared to the other two UV-A filters (BMDBM and TDCS), and that therefore the replacement of BMDBM and TDCS with the same amount of DHHB necessarily leads to an increase in the sun protection factor.

3.6.7 However, the respondent has not provided evidence for this. Thus, it is particularly not demonstrated whether, or which of the used UV-A filters has an increased efficacy compared to the others. However, the experiments have shown that with a constant total amount of UV-A filters (4.00 parts), the use of the sole UV-A filter DHHB leads to an improvement in the sun protection factor (19 vs. 17) compared to the use of a mixture of this with other UV-A filters (BMDBM and TDCS).

3.6.8 The appellant further argued regarding document D16 that a direct comparison with document D9 is not possible, as the formulations compared in document D16 exhibit too many differences compared to the formulation from document D9.

3.6.9 However, this argument is not suitable to question that an increase in the sun protection factor can be achieved by the use of the sole UV-A filter DHHB.

3.6.10 Firstly, it should be noted that the formulations according to document D16, like those according to document D9, contain DHHB as a UV-A filter and EHT as a UV-B filter, as well as the substances Glycerin Monostearate SE, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetearyl Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol, Zinc Oxide HP1, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dicaprylate Carbonate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethanol, and possibly the other UV-A filters Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethan (BMDBM) and Terephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid (TDCS). The formulation according to document D9 additionally contains the broad-spectrum filter Drometrizol Trisiloxane as well as Glycine Soja and perfume. Thus, there is a considerable agreement regarding the ingredients of the compared formulations. Although the appellant has doubted that the technical effect mentioned in point 3.6.5 can actually be derived from document D16, it has not been demonstrated, nor is it otherwise apparent, what specific effects the differences cited by them, particularly the presence of the broad-spectrum filter and the varying amounts of the contained substances, have on the observed technical effect. Therefore, in the absence of contrary evidence, it must be assumed that the technical effect of increasing the sun protection factor from 17 to 19 established by the comparison of the formulations ""UV-20-077-5-5"" and ""UV-20-077-5-6"" can be attributed to the replacement of two parts of DHHB, one part of BMDBM, and one part of TDCS with four parts of DHHB. It is also credible that such an effect occurs even compared to the formulation disclosed in document D9, example 1, no. 6, if the two UV-A filters BMDBM and TDCS were also replaced by the same amount of DHHB.

3.6.11 Furthermore, document D17 shows that increasing the proportion of the UV-A filter DHHB leads to an increase in the sun protection factor. For example, increasing from 2.50 parts of DHHB (formulation ""UV-20-077-1-3"") to 6.00 parts (formulation ""UV-20-077-1-4"") results in a change from 58 to 162. This increase is undoubtedly attributable to the sole distinguishing feature of the proportion of DHHB, which according to calculations by the respondent not disputed by the appellant corresponds to a change in the ratio of the mass of UV-A filters to the sum of the masses of UV-B and broad-spectrum filters from 0.4 (outside the claimed range) to 1.2 (within the claimed range). For the reasons already stated in relation to document D16, this technical effect attributable to the proportion of the UV-A filter in the total mass of the used filters is also transferable to formulations according to document D9. This relationship is also evident from documents D18 and D19.

3.6.12 Thus, it can be derived from the available experimental data that the addition of the UV-A filter to a formulation containing the UV-B filter EHT leads to an improvement in the sun protection factor (in particular Table 2). It can also be inferred that this improvement is either caused by the use of DHHB as the sole UV-A filter (document D16), or by the increase in the mass proportion of DHHB in the total mass of the contained UV filters (documents D17 to D19). That this conclusion also applies to formulations containing the UV-B filter DHB instead of EHT, or mixtures of the two, is also credible, as these are structurally related compounds, namely each being a triazine.

3.6.13 Therefore, the objective technical problem can be seen as providing a method by which the sun protection factor of cosmetic and/or dermatological formulations disclosed in document D9 can be increased, wherein these formulations contain at least one UV-B filter selected from EHT and DBT.

Solution of the Stated Technical Problem

3.7 To solve this problem, claim 1 of the main request provides a method in which DHHB is added as the sole UV-A filter during the manufacture of the formulation, and in which the final cosmetic and/or dermatological formulation has a value for the ratio of the sum of the mass of the UV-A filter to the sum of the mass of the UV-B filters and broad-spectrum filters set from 1 to 6. These measures solve the stated problem.

Non-Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

3.8 From document D9, the skilled person learns that hydroxybenzophenones can be used to increase the UV protection performance of triazine and/or benzotriazole-containing light-protective cosmetic and/or dermatological formulations (claim 9).

As a hydroxybenzophenone, DHHB is proposed (claim 4 as well as page 5, lines 5 to 9), and as possible triazines EHT (claim 5 as well as page 15 to 18) and DBT (claim 5 as well as page 7, line 27 to page 8, line 4).

According to document D9, for example, the sun protection factor or the IPD value serves as a measure of the UV protection performance mentioned in claim 9 (document D9: page 4, lines 4 to 5).

The sun protection factor serves as a measure of protection against UV-B radiation (contested patent: paragraphs [0004], [0005], [0014], and [0030] as well as document D9, page 4, lines 7 to 10), and the IPD value or the PPD value is used to determine the UV-A protection performance (contested patent: paragraph [0012]; document D9: page 4, lines 12 to 16; document D8: paragraph [0031]).

Thus, the skilled person derives from the disclosure of document D9 that the UV-A filter DHHB can be used to increase the UV protection performance. However, since this consists of both UV-A and UV-B protection, and the UV-B protection of a cosmetic and/or dermatological formulation according to claim 9 is already ensured by the triazines and/or benzotriazines contained therein, the skilled person will only take from document D9 the teaching that the use of DHHB serves to protect against UV-A radiation. A connection between the use of DHHB and the improvement of the sun protection factor (i.e., the UV-B protection) cannot be derived from the document. For this reason alone, the subject matter of claim 1 according to the main request is not suggested by document D9. The fact that the combination of claims 4 and 5 of document D9 can in principle lead to formulations that contain both DHHB and EHT or DBT does not change this.

3.9 Consequently, document D9 does not contain the teaching to use DHHB as the sole UV-A filter to improve the sun protection factor, nor the teaching to increase the sun protection factor through a specific ratio of DHHB as the sole UV-A filter to the sum of the masses of the UV-B filters and broad-spectrum filters.

3.10 The appellant also referred to document D8. However, from the disclosure of this document, no connection can be derived between the addition of the UV-A filter DHHB to a formulation containing at least one of the two UV-B filters EHT or DBT, and an increase in the sun protection factor.

3.11 Although claim 1 of the document discloses cosmetic or dermatological formulations containing DHHB, and paragraphs [0040], [0043], and [0046] refer to the fact that the formulations according to the invention, i.e., those containing DHHB, have a high sun protection factor, the skilled person does not derive from this disclosure that the addition of DHHB is responsible for the increase in the sun protection factor. Rather, document D8 also refers to the use of the UV-B filters DBT and EHT (paragraphs [0105] and [0106]). Thus, the skilled person derives from document D8, as from document D9, that the UV-A filter DHHB is responsible for the UV-A protection performance of the formulations (paragraph [0034]). In contrast, paragraph [0040] merely establishes a connection between the sun protection factor and light protection filter substances in general, but not between the sun protection factor and UV-A filters. Also, in paragraph [0043], a distinction is made between sun protection factors and UV-A protection performance.

3.12 Thus, even with the aid of the technical teaching of document D8, the claimed method is not suggested.

3.13 Consequently, the appellant's argument does not lead to the conclusion that the method according to claim 1 of the main request is disclosed in an obvious manner. Its provision is therefore based on an inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

Claim 2

3.14 Claim 2 relates to the use of the UV-A filter DHHB to increase the sun protection factor of a formulation that contains at least one of the UV-B filters EHT or DBT and possibly a UV broad-spectrum filter, wherein the mass ratio of the UV filters of the formulation, as in claim 1, is also in the range of 1 to 6. For the reasons cited regarding claim 1, inventive step is also present for the use according to claim 2 (Article 56 EPC).

Claim 3

3.15 Claim 3 relates to cosmetic and/or dermatological formulations. These also contain DHHB as the sole UV-A filter as well as at least one of the two UV-B filters EHT or DBT. In contrast to the method according to claim 1 or the use according to claim 2, the formulation according to claim 3 does not contain a broad-spectrum filter. Furthermore, the mass ratio of the UV-A filter DHHB to the sum of the UV-B filters is from 1 to 8, compared to 1 to 6 according to claims 1 and 2.

Claim 3 therefore differs from the aforementioned examples of document D9 at least by the features mentioned above.

In view of the technical effect caused by these distinguishing features mentioned in point 3.6.12 of this decision, the objective technical problem can be seen as providing an improved light-protective formulation.

For the reasons already cited in points 3.8 and 3.9, the skilled person is not suggested to modify the formulations mentioned in document D9 according to the claims, i.e., either to use DHHB as the sole UV-A filter or to adjust the mass ratio of the UV filters according to the claims.

Thus, there is also an inventive step for the provision of formulations according to claim 3 (Article 56 EPC).

Auxiliary Requests

4. Since the reasons presented by the appellant for maintaining the main request of the patent proprietor do not contradict, a discussion of the auxiliary requests is unnecessary.

5. In summary, it should be noted that the patent based on the present main request of the respondent - the auxiliary request 3 of the opposition proceedings - meets the requirements of Articles 123(2), 83, and 56 EPC. The decision of the Opposition Division contested by the opponent thus stands.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,appeal dismissed,DSM Nutritional Products Ltd,DSM Nutritional Products Ltd Wurmisweg 576 4303 Kaiseraugst / CH,Lederer & Keller Patentanwälte Partnerschaft mbB Unsöldstraße 2 80538 München / DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeals of Opponents 1 to 3 are directed against the decision of the Opposition Division dated March 11, 2021, to maintain European Patent No. 2 438 903 in amended form under Article 101(3)(a) EPC.

II. The Patent Owner filed an appeal on December 22, 2020, against the short communication of the Opposition Division dated December 21, 2020. In the short communication, the Patent Owner's request for an oral hearing before the Opposition Division at the premises of the European Patent Office was rejected.

III. The two appeals were consolidated under a common appeal number.

IV. The Patent Owner (Respondent) withdrew its appeal against the short communication of the Opposition Division by written submission dated June 12, 2023. Therefore, a decision on this matter is unnecessary.

The present decision relates to the appeals of Opponents 1 to 3 mentioned above in point I.

V. In the opposition proceedings, the patent was challenged under Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC) and lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC), under Article 100(b) for lack of sufficiency of disclosure, and under Article 100(c) for inadmissible amendments.

VI. The Opposition Division concluded in its decision that the invention claimed in the granted patent was sufficiently disclosed. Furthermore, the amendments made were supported by the originally filed application. The objections raised under Article 100(b) and (c) EPC were therefore not convincing. Additionally, the claimed subject matter was novel (Article 100(a) and 54 EPC) but did not involve an inventive step. Rather, the skilled person was led to provide the claimed cosmetic preparation based on documents D2 or D15 (Article 100(a) and 56 EPC).

Claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 1, on the other hand, also met the requirements of Article 56 EPC.

VII. The Appellants 1 to 3 (Opponents 1 to 3) argued their appeals on the grounds that the decision of the Opposition Division was erroneous in recognizing an inventive step for the provision of the preparation according to Claim 1 of Auxiliary Request 1. Furthermore, the request did not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, contrary to the view of the Opposition Division.

VIII. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the Board informed the parties of its preliminary opinion on the legal and factual situation.

XII. Claim 1 of the present Auxiliary Request 3 has the following wording:

""Use of a cosmetic preparation in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion (O/W emulsion), containing a UV filter combination comprising

XIII. In their appeal submissions and in the further proceedings, the Appellants essentially argued regarding the relevant point of inventive step for the present decision as follows:

The only distinguishing feature of the claimed preparation over the closest prior art (documents D2 or D15), i.e., the higher content of ethanol, does not produce any technical effect, in particular no improvement in water resistance. Such a technical effect is not evident from the submitted experiments, neither according to the patent in dispute nor according to documents D43, D23, or D26. The technical problem of providing an alternative cosmetic sun protection preparation is solved in an obvious manner by providing the claimed preparation, as the skilled person would routinely vary the ethanol content in known preparations. Even in document D2 itself, as a possible closest prior art, a value within the claimed range is disclosed to the skilled person.

The question of inventive step must also be assessed based on the disclosure of document D5.

XIV. In its response to the appeal submissions and in the further proceedings, the Respondent essentially argued regarding the relevant point of inventive step for the present decision as follows:

Document D2 represents the closest prior art. The cosmetic preparation claimed in the main request in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion differs from preparations according to D2 (in particular) by the amount of ethanol contained therein. This leads to an improvement in the water resistance of the obtained sun protection preparation. Evidence of a technical effect can be found both in the patent itself and in documents D43, D23, and D26. The solved technical problem thus lies in providing a cosmetic preparation with increased water resistance. Since the skilled person is not aware of the relationship between the ethanol content and the resulting higher water resistance from the prior art, an inventive step is present.

XV. An oral hearing took place on August 10, 2023, at the end of which the decision was announced.

XVI. The final requests of the parties are as follows:

The Appellants 1, 2, and 3 (Opponents 1, 2, and 3) request the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of European Patent No. 2 438 903.

The Respondent (Patent Owner) requests the dismissal of the appeal (and thus the maintenance of the patent based on Auxiliary Request 1 submitted in the opposition proceedings), alternatively the maintenance of the patent based on one of Auxiliary Requests 2 and 3 submitted in the opposition proceedings.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

Main Request (Auxiliary Request 1 of the contested decision)

2. In the contested decision, the opposition division affirmed the presence of inventive step based on the technical teaching of documents D2 or D15. It based its decision on the fact that the higher proportion of ethanol in the claimed formulation of 6 to 10 wt.% compared to 3 wt.% (document D2) or 5 wt.% (D15), and the simultaneous omission of parabens and phenoxyethanol as preservatives, resulted in increased water resistance. This was demonstrated by the comparative tests disclosed in the contested patent. Since this relationship was not known from the prior art, inventive step is present.

3. The parties particularly disputed whether the claimed amount of ethanol in the formulation leads to an improvement in water resistance or not. Accordingly, the technical problem is to be seen either as providing an alternative (appellants) or an improved (respondent) cosmetic formulation in terms of water resistance. The parties were also in disagreement regarding additional distinguishing features.

4. The Board follows the argumentation of the appellants. The reasons for this are as follows:

The Contested Patent

5. The contested patent deals with sunscreens. These are intended to have a lower content of preservatives and higher water resistance compared to conventional sunscreens (see paragraphs [0001], [0005], and [0007]). According to claim 1, a cosmetic formulation in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion is proposed, which contains a UV filter combination consisting of the four components a) to d). Furthermore, it does not contain selected preservatives, and it has a content of 6 to 10 wt.% ethanol.

Closest Prior Art

6. Document D2 discloses cosmetic sunscreens. These are preferably in the form of O/W emulsions and are intended to exhibit, among other things, increased water resistance (see paragraphs [0004], [0011], [0015], and [0073]). The document discloses examples with formulations that contain the four UV filter components according to claim 1 of the main request. In particular, as also proposed by the parties, the example ""Emulsion O"" on pages 13 and 14 of the document is suitable as a starting point for assessing inventive step.

7. Since, as explained below, the provision of the formulations claimed in the contested patent based on document D2 as the closest prior art does not involve an inventive step, an assessment based on further documents is not decisive for the present decision. This is particularly true because the losing respondent preferred the argumentation based on document D2 as the closest prior art.

Distinguishing Feature

8. In the example ""Emulsion O"" of document D2, a formulation in the form of an O/W emulsion is disclosed, which has a filter combination from components a) to d) according to claim 1 of the main request (see the table on pages 13 and 14, in particular lines 15, 16, 20, and 22 of page 14).

This was undisputed between the parties.

9. The formulation ""Emulsion O"" also contains three parts ""Alcohol"". The proportion of the components ""Perfume, Preservatives"" is not specified (""q.s."").

10. The Board agrees with the opinion of the opposition division and the appellants that ""Emulsion O"" contains 3 wt.% alcohol in the form of ethanol. The formulation is a specific composition. Therefore, it will not contain any arbitrary, merely generically defined additional alcohol, but specifically the ethanol mentioned as preferred in paragraph [0048]. This was not disputed by the respondent during the oral proceedings.

11. The Board also agrees with the appellants that the formulation ""Emulsion O"" does not contain the preservatives excluded in claim 1 of the main request. While perfumes and preservatives may be present in the formulation ""Emulsion O"", this is only if necessary (q.s., quantum satis). According to paragraph [0040] of the document, advantageous formulations can be obtained if they contain the preservatives parabens or phenoxyethanol that are excluded in the claims. However, since this does not apply to all disclosed formulations, but only to those that are advantageous according to the invention, it cannot be assumed that ""Emulsion O"" necessarily contains these components.

12. As a result, the formulation claimed in claim 1 of the main request differs from the formulation according to ""Emulsion O"" of document D2 only in that it contains 6 to 10 wt.% ethanol instead of 3 wt.% .

Objective Technical Problem

13. The contested patent discloses in the table in paragraph [0044] two examples of formulations ""Product 1"" and ""Product 2"". Both formulations have an ethanol content within the claimed range of 6 to 10 wt.%. These examples cannot therefore demonstrate a technical effect based on the distinguishing feature of an increased ethanol content compared to document D2.

14. The patent holder also referred to document D43 submitted by appellant 3. This document shows, contrary to the statements of the appellants, that the selection of the claimed range of ethanol results in an improvement in the water resistance of the examined formulations.

15. The Board does not follow these statements.

In document D43, formulations are examined that are modeled after those of ""Emulsion O"" of document D2. The three formulations disclosed in Table 1 differ only in their ethanol content (see the last line of the table: 3, 8, and 11 wt.%).

This was undisputed.

In the section ""III. Results"" of document D43, it is stated that the three tested formulations initially appear to differ in their water resistance (44% vs. 47% vs. 43%). However, it is noted in the first line of the section that the results were only given with a confidence interval of 90%. In this regard, appellant 3 argued that this accuracy is not sufficient to distinguish the obtained values of water resistance. This is also expressed in document D43 itself by the statement regarding the results that the ethanol content does not lead to increased water resistance, and therefore no technical effect based on the ethanol content has been demonstrated.

The results of document D43 therefore also do not show that a change in the ethanol content between 3 and 8 wt.% leads to an improvement in water resistance within the examined formulations.

16. The respondent also referred to documents D23 and D26.

However, these documents are also not suitable to demonstrate a technical effect attributable to the mentioned distinguishing feature.

Documents D23 and D26 each disclose two examples, which, however, do not differ in alcohol content. The formulations according to document D23 each contain 2 wt.% ethanol, while those according to document D26 each contain 5 wt.%. The observed differences in water resistance (57.60 and 78.80% for the two formulations according to document D23; 134.49 and 142.34% according to document D26) cannot therefore be attributed to a different ethanol content.

17. Thus, there is no credible evidence that a different ethanol content leads to a special technical effect.

18. The objective technical problem therefore lies in providing an alternative cosmetic formulation suitable as a sunscreen compared to the formulation ""Emulsion O"" disclosed in document D2.

Proposed Solution

19. According to claim 1 of the present main request, a cosmetic formulation in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion is proposed to solve this problem, which, in addition to a UV filter combination of the four compounds a) to d), contains ethanol - in particular in an amount of 6 to 10 wt.% based on the total weight of the formulation.

The Board is convinced that the stated technical problem is solved by the claimed formulation.

Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

20. In document D2, the alcohol content in the disclosed formulations is not presented as critical (see paragraph [0048]). Furthermore, in paragraph [0080] of the document, a formulation is already disclosed that contains an alcohol content of 8.0 wt.%. Therefore, in the search for a solution to the stated technical problem of providing an alternative cosmetic sunscreen formulation, the skilled person would modify the formulation ""Emulsion O"" in a routine manner, for example, to have a slightly higher ethanol content, such as the content of 8.0 wt.% disclosed in paragraph [0080]. The provision of the claimed formulation thus does not require inventive step.

Result on the Main Request

21. Since the provision of the claimed cosmetic formulation does not involve an inventive step, and the main request therefore does not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC, it is not allowable for this reason alone. A discussion of further objections raised by the appellants is unnecessary.

Auxiliary Requests

22. The respondent pursued auxiliary requests 2 and 3 that had already been submitted during the opposition proceedings.

23. Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 relates to the use of a combination of the four compounds a) to d) referred to in the present main request as a UV filter combination for the production of water-resistant and/or preservative-free cosmetic formulations in the form of an O/W emulsion. The formulation is also free from the preservatives mentioned in claim 1 of the main request. However, it contains 2 to 12 wt.% ethanol, in contrast to the formulation according to claim 1 of the main request with 6 to 10 wt.% .

24. Claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 relates to the use of a cosmetic formulation in the form of an O/W emulsion as a water-resistant cosmetic formulation. The formulation is defined as the formulation according to claim 1 of the main request, but it contains 2 to 12 wt.% ethanol instead of only 6 to 10 wt.% .

25. The respondent did not present any arguments beyond its submissions regarding the main request to demonstrate inventive step. Rather, during the oral proceedings, it confirmed that the auxiliary requests do not create any new facts regarding inventive step.

26. The Board notes that the subject matter claimed in auxiliary requests 2 and 3 does not involve an inventive step for the same reasons as claim 1 of the main request based on the disclosure of document D2.

27. Therefore, auxiliary requests 2 and 3 are not allowable.

28. The ground for opposition under Article 100(a) in conjunction with Article 56 EPC is therefore decisive.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: 1.

I. The Opponent (Appellant) filed an appeal against the decision of the Opposition Division to reject the opposition against the contested patent.

In the opposition proceedings, the Opponent requested the revocation of the contested patent in its entirety based on the grounds for opposition under Article 100 a) EPC in conjunction with Article 54 and Article 56 EPC (lack of novelty and lack of inventive step) as well as Article 100 b) EPC.

II. The Opposition Division decided, among other things, that the patent disclosed the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for a person skilled in the art to carry it out, and that the subject matter of the claims in the granted form was novel and inventive.

III. The Board issued a communication under Article 15 (1) RPBA 2020.

IV. The wording of claim 1 of the main request (patent as granted) is as follows:

""Process for the production of methyl methacrylate, comprising the steps:

(A) producing methacrolein from propanal and formaldehyde and

(B) converting the methacrolein obtained in step A) in an oxidative esterification reaction to methyl methacrylate,

characterized in that both steps A) and B) are carried out in the liquid phase at a pressure of 2 to 100 bar and step B) is conducted in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst containing metals and/or metal oxides and noble metals.""

VI. The submissions of the Appellant, insofar as relevant for the decision, can be summarized as follows:

The new experimental report submitted by the Respondent with the reply to the statement of grounds of appeal, and the related statements under point 6.5 of said reply, should not be admitted into the proceedings. Furthermore, the claimed subject matter is not sufficiently disclosed. Among other things, comparative examples 1 to 3 of D4 show that even in the core area of the term ""noble metal,"" noble metal-containing catalysts as defined in claim 1 would not achieve the oxidative esterification step B) to MMA. Moreover, the examples in the patent cover only a fraction of the claimed range using gold as the noble metal and silica-based supports, and the patent does not disclose any selection criteria for determining suitable catalysts for process step B). The type and amount of noble metal and the metals and/or metal oxides contained in the catalyst, the type of support and its ratio to the active component, as well as the form of the active component are variables to be determined by the skilled person (cf. points 44 a - g of the statement of grounds of appeal). Thus, the subject matter of the claims calls for the execution of a research program.

The claimed subject matter is also not novel with respect to documents D1, D6, and D7.

Regarding inventive step, there are no comparative tests showing the influence of pressure in steps A) and B) of the claimed process as the only varied parameter, let alone across the entire breadth of claim 1. The process steps A) and B) under reaction conditions as defined in claim 1 are, however, known from the prior art. In the absence of a demonstrated technical effect and consequently assuming the provision of an alternative as an objectively solvable problem, the subject matter of claim 1 thus lacks inventive step starting from D6, D7, D10, or D11 as the closest prior art.

VII. The submissions of the Patent Proprietor (Respondent), insofar as relevant for the decision, can be summarized as follows:

The new factual submissions of the Appellant regarding the issue of sufficient disclosure in points 33 to 75 of the statement of grounds of appeal should not be admitted into the proceedings. Furthermore, the new submissions of the Appellant in points 218 to 263 and 307 to 321 should not be admitted into the proceedings. The experimental report submitted with the reply to the statement of grounds of appeal was submitted at the earliest possible time and should therefore be admitted into the proceedings. The subject matter of the granted claims is also sufficiently disclosed, novel with respect to documents D1, D6, and D7, and also involves an inventive step.

VIII. The Appellant requests the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

The Respondent requests that the appeal be dismissed. Alternatively, it requests the maintenance of the patent in the scope of one of the auxiliary requests 1 to 4, all submitted with the reply to the statement of grounds of appeal.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Sufficient Disclosure (Article 100(b) EPC) - Main Request

1.1 The parties did not provide any further comments on the matter regarding the provisional assessment of the Board in its communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA 2020. Therefore, the Board sees no reason to deviate from its preliminary opinion regarding the issue of sufficient disclosure. The relevant assessment of the Board in its communication is reproduced below.

1.2 ""5.1 The Respondent requests that the new factual submissions of the Appellant regarding the issue of sufficient disclosure not be admitted into the proceedings.

5.2 This submission relies in points 58 to 75 of the statement of appeal, among other things, on comparative examples 1 to 3 of D4. The Board notes that the objections raised during the opposition proceedings essentially relied on the lack of delineation of the term ""noble metal"" and the alleged contradiction between claims 1 and 6 in this regard, but not on the ""core area"" of the term as defined in document D15, including copper, silver, rhenium, and mercury. The current attack, based on D4, however, targets this core area. The attack is therefore to be regarded as an amendment under Article 12(2) RPBA 2020 and could and should have been raised in the first-instance proceedings. The fact that the opposition division criticized the lack of substantiation of the objection of insufficient disclosure in its decision does not preclude this, as such an objection must always be substantiated (for example, here with the already available evidence D4). Furthermore, the reference in the decision that other metals (apart from noble metals) are present in the noble metal-containing catalysts does not seem to relate to the new objection based on D4. According to the decision (and the minutes, penultimate paragraph on page 1), this point was discussed during the hearing before the opposition division. The Opponent could therefore have raised the said objection during the hearing. At the same time, admitting the new attack would seem detrimental to procedural economy, as it would shift the focus compared to the first-instance proceedings. This would contradict the primary objective of the appeal proceedings, which is to judicially review the contested decision. The Board therefore intends not to admit the corresponding new submission, as set out in points 58 to 75 of the statement of appeal, into the proceedings (Article 12(4) and (6) RPBA 2020).

5.3 The objection that the examples cover only a fraction of the claimed range and that no selection rule is available for determining suitable catalysts (see points 33 to 43 of the statement of appeal) was also not raised in the opposition proceedings. Therefore, there was also no reason for the opposition division to address this point. Thus, the objections in the statement of appeal regarding this matter also seem to go beyond the subject matter of the first-instance proceedings. Their consideration would again contradict the principle of procedural economy.

5.4 Similarly, the arguments presented in points 44 to 57 of the statement of appeal represent an amendment compared to the first-instance submissions of the Opponent. In the first instance, the Opponent argued that no guidance was provided by a clear definition of the catalyst in the patent (especially in light of claim 6). Points 44 to 57, however, refer to variables ""a"" to ""g"" as indicated in point 44 of the statement of appeal. The admission of this submission would therefore also exceed the scope of the first-instance proceedings. Its judicial review as a primary objective of the appeal proceedings would thus be rendered moot (cf. Article 12(2) RPBA 2020).

5.5 However, the Board points out that it does not find the arguments presented to be convincing in substance. Firstly, claim 1 is directed, among other things, to the feature ""noble metal-containing catalyst."" However, the extent of the catalysis is not specified in claim 1 and can therefore be low. Moreover, claim 1 merely requires that the catalyst is noble metal-containing (i.e., contains a noble metal). Suitable catalysts are described in paragraphs [0077-0080, 0088-0098] of the patent. These may include, for example, gold (cf. D12), palladium (D8), or nickel (cf. D13) as the predominantly present metal and may have additional (noble) metals (for example, as an alloy component), see also paragraphs [0085, 0086] and [0089]. Thus, it is plausible for the Board that gold-, nickel-, and/or palladium-based oxidation catalysts, which contain other (noble) metals (such as alloys and/or mixtures of metal nanocrystals, cf. claim 5), fulfill the functional feature ""catalysis."" Therefore, the Board does not understand why other noble metal-containing catalysts (containing, for example, copper, platinum, and/or silver) would not have been accessible to the skilled person as of the priority date, considering the general technical knowledge regarding the entire breadth of claim 1 (here regarding the selection of noble metal elements) without necessitating an unreasonable research program. In this regard, the failure of direct esterification with specific rhodium and platinum compounds in D4 is disclosed and not ""hidden."" A general unsuitability of these noble metals as components of catalysts for oxidative direct esterification according to claim 1 does not arise from this.

5.6 Furthermore, claim 1 is not directed to the oxidation catalysts themselves (i.e., not as in T 544/12 to [among others] a chemical compound), but rather, among other things, to a synthesis process with specific procedural steps A) and B) as the focus. Thus, in the Board's view, the fact that the synthesis of the (non-claimed) catalysts may involve a variety of support materials and additional criteria a) - g) according to point 44 of the statement of appeal does not seem to contradict the enablement across the entire breadth of claim 1. Furthermore, it has not been substantiated that a skilled person, based on the information in the patent, their general technical knowledge, and the specific examples, could not have realized modifications of the catalysts with reasonable effort that would catalyze the oxidation with oxygen.

5.7 Therefore, in the Board's view, neither the optional presence of additional metals (such as lithium or sodium according to claim 6, which the skilled person would not consider as noble metals) nor the question of delineating the term ""noble metals"" leads to an insufficient disclosure of the claimed subject matter. These questions would at most fall under the requirements of Article 84 EPC, which is not applicable to granted claims (G 3/14).""

1.3 Therefore, the ground for opposition under Article 100(b) EPC does not preclude the maintenance of the patent.

2. Novelty (Article 100(a) and 54(1) EPC) - Main Request

2.1 In response to the provisional assessment of the Board, expressed in its communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA 2020, that the subject matter of the granted claims is novel, the parties did not present any new arguments. Therefore, the relevant assessment of the Board, which remains unchanged, is reproduced below.

2.2 The Board shares the opinion of the opposition division that the subject matter of claim 1 is novel over D1. Figure 1 is first introduced in the text under point 2. The starting point here is the consideration that C2-C4 hydrocarbons are used as starting material for the synthesis of MMA. Contrary to the Appellant's assertion, a combination of the step of the BASF process described in point 3.1 starting from propanal to methacrolein as the first step (component of a C2 route) with the direct oxidative esterification of methacrolein with methanol as the second step described in paragraph 5.4 of D1 via a C4 route is not disclosed in the publication, let alone an immediate and unambiguous disclosure of the combination of all features of claim 1, including the pressure conditions (cf. point 2.5 below and point 5.1.6 of the reply to the statement of appeal).

2.3 Figure 1 of D1 does not specify reaction conditions for the processes described in the text and suggests branching points/references that are not described in the text: starting from propanal to methacrolein via formylation, followed by either i) oxidation to methacrylic acid and its esterification with methanol or ii) direct oxidative esterification of methacrolein with methanol/O2. However, option ii) starting from propanal is not described at all in D1, let alone supported by reaction conditions (catalyst, pressure, etc.).

2.4 Starting from Figure 1, the choice of propanal from a variety of C3 compounds would be considered a first selection, followed by a second selection of whether to pursue the route (cf. section 3.1 of D1) or instead to directly esterify methacrolein with methanol. Thus, the subject matter of claim 1 would not be directly disclosed in Figure 1, apart from the objections from point 2.3 regarding this derivation approach. As a third selection, the pressure range of 2 to 100 bar would need to be chosen (reference to D3 and D14 in footnotes [2,3] of D1).

2.5 In the documents D4 and D5/D5a mentioned by reference on page 375 of D1, either normal pressure is preferred (D4) or is included (D5/D5a). Thus, another (fourth) selection step is also necessary to select pressures according to claim 1.

2.6 Claim 1 is therefore novel over D1. The same applies to dependent claims 2 to 17.

2.7 Similarly, D6 discloses step A) of claim 1 (under incorrect reference) on page 4-3, but step B) in isolation in connection with the production of methacrolein (MAL) from tert-butanol or isobutylene (Asahi process). The paragraph titled ""Condensation of Propionaldehyde and Formaldehyde to MA"" on page 4-3 of D6 is mentioned in connection with a C2-based route starting from ethylene, which concludes with the esterification of methacrylic acid with methanol. In contrast, the text section titled ""MMA from Isobutylene/t-Butyl Alcohol via Methacrolein by a Two-Step Process"" on pages 4-20 to 4-21 of D6 is directed to a process for MMA synthesis starting from isobutylene or t-butyl alcohol as C4 compounds.

Regarding the corresponding statements in point 134 of the statement of appeal, the Board cannot conclude from the fact that the oxidation of methacrolein to methacrylic acid and the esterification of methacrylic acid with methanol in C4-based routes (to MMA) are common practice that D6 would disclose the combination of steps A) and B) according to claim 1.

2.8 Analogous to the statements in point 2.3, Figure 4.1 also does not provide a link of the route to methacrolein via propanal-formaldehyde condensation of the BASF process with the direct oxidative esterification of methacrolein according to the second step of the Asahi process. Figure 4.1 appears rather to be a flowchart to illustrate the synthesis routes described in the text. The combination of steps A) and B) according to claim 1 is not derivable from Figure 4.1, in accordance with the descriptive text. Even if this were disregarded, this scheme would first require the selection of propanal as a precursor to methacrolein (instead of isobutylene or tert-butanol), secondly the choice of direct oxidative esterification with methanol/O2 instead of synthesis with an intermediate step via methacrylic acid, and thirdly the precise reaction conditions (pressure, catalyst, etc.), which Figure 4.1 does not specify at all.

2.9 The subject matter of claim 1 is also not derivable from D7. Figure 1.1 does not depict the claimed synthesis route, as the direct oxidative esterification of methacrolein with oxygen/methanol is not disclosed. Furthermore, the BASF process (reaction pathway propionaldehyde/methacrolein/methacrylic acid/MMA) is not described on page 38 in any connection with the Asahi process on pages 51 to 53 of D7.

The statements in points 154/155 of the statement of appeal, according to which the reaction to methacrolein via propanal is linked with synthesis routes (to MMA) based on C4 compounds (and particularly with oxidation and esterification), are not found convincing by the Board. The third paragraph on page 39 of D7 is directed to the oxidative synthesis of methacrylic acid and not of MMA. How the combinability (let alone an implicit disclosure of this combination) of the first step of the BASF process (starting from propanal), corresponding to step A) of claim 1, with the oxidative direct esterification according to step B) starting from methacrolein can be concluded is not clear to the Board. Therefore, the subject matter of claim 1 (as well as that of the dependent claims) is also not disclosed in D7 and is thus novel. The ground for opposition under Article 100(a) EPC in conjunction with Article 54(1) EPC does not preclude the maintenance of the patent.

3. Inventive Step (Article 100(a) and 56 EPC) - Main Request

3.1 Again, the parties did not submit any new inputs regarding the question of inventive step following the issuance of the communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA 2020. Therefore, the Board sees no reason to deviate from its provisional assessment in this regard, which is reproduced below.

""7.1 Admissibility of the experimental report submitted with the reply to the statement of appeal (Article 12(4) and (6) RPBA 2020)

The Appellant requests that the experimental report submitted with the reply to the statement of appeal not be admitted into the appeal proceedings. Furthermore, the new factual assertions presented in paragraph 6.5 of the reply should not be admitted.

The Board provisionally follows the argumentation of the Respondent in point 2.1 of their submission dated August 18, 2022, that the experimental report is to be regarded as a reaction to the objections raised for the first time in the letter dated November 12, 2020, against the examples of the patent. Given the temporal proximity of this submission to the date of the oral proceedings before the opposition division, it was realistically no longer possible for the patent owner to conduct and submit further comparative experiments. Likewise, the provisional opinion of the opposition division regarding inventive step was positive. The comparative experiments also do not seem to go beyond the scope defined in the patent. Therefore, the Board intends to admit the experimental report of the Respondent and the corresponding argumentation under point 6.5 of the reply to the statement of appeal into the proceedings (Article 12(4) and (6) RPBA 2020).

7.2 The Board shares the opinion of the opposition division and the Respondent that document D10/D10a is directed on the one hand to the same purpose as the patent, namely the provision of methyl methacrylate, and on the other hand requires the fewest changes in the production process to arrive at the claimed subject matter. Unlike the other alternative starting points for the analysis of inventive step presented by the Appellant (D6, D7, and D11), the reactants of the reaction in D10 already correspond to the claimed ones. Thus, only process parameters would need to be changed, and not entire process blocks exchanged.

7.3 D10 describes the reaction conduct of the conversion of propanal with formaldehyde to methacrolein and its direct oxidative esterification with methanol, each under reflux. It seems undisputed that the claimed process differs from that described in D10 in that steps A) and B) are carried out at 2 to 100 bar.

7.4 The Respondent asserts a higher overall selectivity due to the execution of the process at pressures between 2 and 100 bar as a resulting effect (see point 6.4.4 of the reply to the statement of appeal and Table 3 of the patent).

7.5 Although, as claimed by the Appellant, the experimental series 5 and 6 of the experimental report submitted with the reply do not seem to be directly comparable (due to simultaneous changes in pressure and temperature within the experimental series), experiments 3a to 4c credibly demonstrate that increasing the pressure of the reaction system leads to improved MMA selectivity and MAL conversion. The temperature is kept constant in these experiments. Despite a somewhat lower amount of catalyst, the conversion and selectivity in experimental series 3 were significantly lower than in experimental series 4. Although pressures of 1 against 11 bar were compared, it seems plausible that the effect (albeit diminished) occurs with lower overpressure. This credibly also increases the overall selectivity of the process compared to D10. Furthermore, the execution of step A) under pressure seems to improve the conversion and selectivity of this partial reaction according to experiment 5a compared to experiment 6a (using MAL according to D10).

7.6 Thus, the Board considers the objective technical problem underlying the subject matter compared to D10 to be the provision of an improved process for the production of methyl methacrylate. The Board further believes that it is credible that this improvement can be achieved across the entire breadth of claim 1 (relatively compared to otherwise analogous embodiments where no increased pressure is applied in steps A) and B)). The fact that a wide variation in selectivities for the conversion of MAL to MMA has been observed in the prior art (as in D8 and D12) does not contradict this, as it is logical that other parameters can also influence the conversion and selectivity of the reaction (such as MAL concentration, reaction temperature, and catalyst composition).

7.7 D10 does not provide any motivation to carry out steps A) and B) at pressures between 2 and 100 bar, let alone a suggestion that this measure could further improve the conversion and selectivity of the transformation of propanal to methacrolein and from methacrolein to methacrylate. Nor does the Board see any encouragement from D10 to consult secondary information sources (the Appellant cited D1, D3, D6, D7, D11) to arrive at this solution. Furthermore, the higher selectivity when applying overpressure (2 to 100 bar) in steps A) and B) does not seem to be derivable from these sources either. For these reasons, the subject matter of claim 1 is considered to be based on inventive step starting from D10.

7.8 D7 also does not appear to disclose the increase in conversion and selectivity in steps A) and B) through reaction conduct under overpressure. This is not derived from the fact that in the specific BASF and Asahi processes (""direct metha route"") for MMA synthesis, overpressure is used in steps A) and B). Thus, this fact does not seem to belong to the general technical knowledge.

7.9 Within the teaching of D7, the combination of the MAL synthesis according to the BASF process with the direct oxidative esterification according to the Asahi process, featuring step B), also does not seem to be obvious. In this context, the Respondent pointed out the different by-product spectrum in the BASF process (feeding a crude MAL containing acetic acid, propionaldehyde, dimethylamine, and water into the subsequent gas-phase oxidation to methacrylic acid, followed by acid esterification with methanol) in point 6.2.1 of the reply. For this reason, it does not seem obvious to the Board to disassemble and recombine these entirely different processes. The esterification according to the BASF process involves acid catalysis and no noble metal-containing oxidation catalyst as in step B) according to claim 1 and the two-step Asahi process (""direct metha route"").

Therefore, the Board does not see why the ""raw"" MAL intermediates of the respective processes should be considered interchangeable from the perspective of D7. Thus, the reference to further secondary information, such as document D8 (see footnote [41] in D7), from the perspective of D7 seems unexpected. D8 further teaches the execution of direct oxidative esterification under sub- to overpressure and does not disclose that increased conversions and selectivities are obtained under overpressure. The use of a crude MAL product as an intermediate from the BASF process as a MAL source is also not suggested in D8.

7.10 The statements in point 7.9 apply similarly to the further attack based on D6 as another cited closest prior art. As stated above in point 6.7 [N.B.: point 2.8 of this decision], the flowchart in Figure 4.1 of D6 does not align with the explanatory text and does not disclose the combination of steps A) and B) according to claim 1, let alone further reaction conditions (reaction phases, catalysts, and pressure). The Board also does not see why a skilled person would have been prompted to conduct a literature search starting from D6 to recognize the reference to US 4,498,770 on page 4-3 of D6 as erroneous, to find it directed to D3, and then to apply it with the oxidative direct esterification in another process (""direct metha route"" from Asahi), which is referenced on page 4-21 to D11. In the latter document, the reaction pressure can also vary according to column 21, lines 51/52, between 0.5 and 20 kg/cm² (approximately 0.5 to 20 bar) and thus between over- and underpressure.

7.11 The Respondent requested that the attack on inventive step based on D11 not be admitted into the proceedings. The Opponent had dropped this in the oral proceedings and only cited D7 and D10 as the closest prior art according to the minutes. As stated in point 7.10, the pressure in D11 can vary between 0.5 and 20 bar. Again, the combination of the oxidative direct esterification of the Asahi process described in D11 with the entirely different BASF process is not obvious for the reasons set out in point 7.9. Even less does it emerge from D11 (for example, in combination with D2 or D3) that the overall selectivity of the reactions is credibly increased when carrying out steps A) and B) at pressures between 2 and 100 bar compared to execution under normal pressure.

7.12 Since the attack based on D11 does not provisionally convince the Board in substance, the question of its admissibility can remain open for now.

7.13 Furthermore, the Respondent requests that the factual submissions of the Appellant in points 218 to 263 of the statement of appeal be not admitted into the proceedings as late submissions. These particularly concern the pressure range of 2 to 100 bar according to claim 1 and unsuitable examples from D4, D8, and D12. Since the submissions do not convince in substance for the reasons mentioned above in point 7.6, the question of their admissibility can also remain open for now. Regarding D4, the failure of the direct oxidative esterification reaction due to compounds that do not function as catalysts would fall under Article 100(b) EPC (see above). Moreover, the Board believes credibly, as stated above, that noble metal-containing compounds are available across the entire breadth of the claims that catalyze the oxidative esterification of methanol with MAL.""

3.2 For the above reasons

- the Board admits the experimental report submitted with the reply to the statement of appeal and the arguments based on it into the appeal proceedings (Article 12(4) and (6) RPBA 2020), and

- concludes that the ground for opposition of lack of inventive step (Article 100(a) in conjunction with Article 56 EPC) does not preclude the maintenance of the contested patent.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",opposition rejected,opposition rejected,appeal dismissed,The Dow Chemical Company,"The Dow Chemical Company 2030 Dow Center Midland, MI 48674 / US",Beck Greener LLP Fulwood House 12 Fulwood Place London WC1V 6HR / GB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The present appeal by the applicant (appellant) is directed against the decision of the examining division, posted on February 11, 2021, to refuse European patent application No. 13 770 444.1.

II. The basis for the contested decision were the amended sets of claims submitted on January 28, 2021, according to the main request and auxiliary requests 1-12.

III. The main request contains five patent claims. Claim 1 is the only independent claim and reads as follows:

""1. Dragee, tablet, powder, or capsule for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of oxidative stress in humans or animals by means of therapeutically effective hydrogen molecules,

wherein the dragee, tablet, powder, or capsule is formulated for direct oral administration or indirect administration in an aqueous solution and administration medium and comprises the following components:

- a first component comprising magnesium for the targeted chemical synthesis of the hydrogen molecules in the reaction with aqueous acid and

- a second component, wherein the second component comprises at least one acid selected from the group consisting of ascorbic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid and is chemically inert with respect to the magnesium of the first component.""

IV. In the matter, the examining division concluded that the subject matter of none of the requests before it was sufficiently disclosed within the meaning of Article 83 EPC, with regard to the implementation of the functional feature ""wherein the second component (...) is chemically inert with respect to the magnesium of the first component.""

V. Together with her statement of appeal, the appellant submitted sets of claims according to the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 12. These are identical to the sets of claims underlying the contested decision (see above point II).

Furthermore, the appellant submitted a written declaration of the inventor (""Written Declaration under Oath of the Inventor Dr. Kurt Lucas according to Article 117(1)(g) EPC"" dated November 5, 2020, hereinafter referred to as D9). This had previously been part of the submissions before the examining division in the filing dated December 8, 2020.

VI. The appellant's arguments can be summarized as follows:

Since the contested decision was based solely on the objection of lack of enablement, it should be assumed that the sets of claims according to the main request and auxiliary requests 1-12 meet the other patentability requirements, including those of Articles 56, 57, and 84 EPC.

Regarding the criterion of enablement according to Article 83 EPC, the application itself, particularly in Example 1, already discloses claimed powders and tablets, thus providing at least one feasible way to implement them. The production of corresponding powders is possible by mixing the components, and the production of tablets can be achieved by co-pressing the two active components with, for example, lactose or mannose using standard methods. As stated in D9, the inventor was able to produce corresponding tablets without difficulty using conventional means. The application also refers to literature on the general knowledge of galenic pharmacy. Therefore, a person skilled in the art would have been able to produce the claimed forms of administration based on the disclosure in the application and their own relevant expertise.

Thus, there is nothing preventing the grant of a patent.

VII. The appellant requested the annulment of the contested decision and

- if the Board considers it necessary to examine the requirements according to Articles 54, 56, and/or 84 EPC, the referral of the matter back to the examining division,

- or otherwise the grant of a patent.

The examination should be based on the sets of claims submitted with the statement of appeal according to the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 12.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Admissibility of the Appeal

The appeal meets the requirements of Articles 106 to 108 and Rule 99 EPC; it is admissible.

2. Main Request - Sufficiency of Disclosure (Article 83 EPC)

2.1 The form of administration to be used is defined in claim 1 of the main request by the following specifications:

a) It is in the form of a dragee, tablet, powder, or capsule.

b) It is ""formulated,"" meaning it is suitable for administration in an aqueous solvent or for oral administration.

c) It contains magnesium and at least one acid selected from ascorbic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid.

d) The magnesium is intended for the targeted synthesis of hydrogen through reaction with aqueous acid, i.e., the form of administration must fundamentally allow for such a reaction.

e) The acid component is ""chemically inert"" with respect to the magnesium in the product. This functional requirement is not further specified by technical features.

2.2 The examining division was of the opinion that the information in the patent application, together with the general knowledge of the skilled person, would not enable a skilled person to formulate magnesium and acid together in one of the claimed forms of administration such that the criterion of ""chemically inert"" according to point e) would be fulfilled. The objection regarding sufficiency of disclosure thus concerns the design of the form of administration or its manufacturability. These concerns were justified by the known high reactivity of magnesium powder, which brings additional difficulties and requirements that the application does not adequately address.

2.3 The Board arrives at a different conclusion for the following reasons:

2.3.1 The feature ""chemically inert"" means in the present context that the two components do not react with each other under the conditions present in the respective forms of administration dragee, tablet, powder, or capsule.

2.3.2 According to the application, the reaction of the acid with the magnesium, which generates hydrogen, takes place in aqueous solution (page 4, line 32 to page 5, line 1 of the originally filed version), which does not correspond to the state of the components in the claimed solid forms of administration.

2.3.3 Furthermore, the application states that magnesium powder can be mixed with ascorbic acid powder and packaged in airtight sachets for trade. It is indicated that a reaction of the two substances in this embodiment could occur during prolonged storage due to the presence of residual moisture (Example 1: page 20, lines 19 to 25).

2.3.4 If no reaction occurs in the absence of residual moisture, the condition ""chemically inert"" is already fulfilled when the acid is present as a solid alongside the magnesium in a powder mixture without residual moisture.

2.3.5 The manufacture of tablets by direct compression, where the magnesium and the acid component are compressed together with excipients, is also disclosed in the application as a possible embodiment (Example 1: page 21, line 12 to page 22, line 2). Excipients additionally contribute to the separation of magnesium and acid, ""if required for longer storage"" (page 21, line 15). It is common to use fillers, especially when the required amounts of active ingredients are rather small (as in the present case, see page 20, lines 9 to 17). In connection with tablet formulation, the text also refers to common excipients known from the prior art, particularly fillers, binders, disintegrants, and lubricants (page 21, line 27 to page 22, line 2). The tablets, which represent a preferred form of administration, can be packaged in standard blisters or tubes (page 21, lines 12 to 14).

2.3.6 D9 indicates that suitable tablets were produced from magnesium powder, ascorbic acid, and lactose or mannose, using magnesium stearate as a common lubricant, with conventional tablet presses according to this embodiment. These were storable for a longer time and still released hydrogen after more than two years of storage when introduced into water (see D9: page 5). Tablets of the same type were also produced with citric acid instead of ascorbic acid.

2.3.7 These results confirm the conclusion arising from the teaching of the application that even with the proposed direct compression, no (premature) reaction of the dry components would be to be feared.

2.3.8 The manufacture of capsules (by filling a mixed powder into capsules) and dragees (with a compressed powder mixture as a core) would also have been possible based on the embodiments of powder mixture and tablet using known methods.

2.3.9 The skilled person would be aware of the reactivity of magnesium with oxygen in air and with water due to their general chemical knowledge and would take care to avoid excessively small particle sizes as well as methods and storage conditions that could bring magnesium into contact with ignition sources or moisture when executing the subject matter of the claim. This would have applied even at the filing or priority date. Therefore, the skilled person had criteria available based on general knowledge for selecting suitable execution options for handling magnesium.

2.3.10 The Board also notes that no specific requirements regarding the shelf life of the forms of administration are made in the present claims and that the manufacture of larger batches is not required. Even a product made by mixing smaller amounts of the two components in powder form or by direct tablet compression of smaller amounts with filler and its timely use are compliant with the claims and do not require an unreasonably high effort for their realization.

2.3.11 For these reasons, the Board is of the opinion that the execution of the form of administration according to claim 1 of the main request is sufficiently disclosed with respect to the feature ""chemically inert,"" and thus the objection raised by the examining division under Article 83 EPC does not apply.

3. Remittal (Article 111(1) EPC)

3.1 In the contested decision, the examining division decided solely on the sufficiency of disclosure according to Article 83 EPC.

3.2 The decision does not contain a conclusive positive assessment of the patentability of the requests with respect to further requirements of the EPC.

3.3 Based on the substantively very similar sets of claims from December 8, 2020, the examining division had also addressed possible objections regarding inventive step in its communication of January 28, 2021 (short communication, see points 2, 8, 12, and 16 there).

3.4 After the Board has concluded that the objection raised by the examining division under Article 83 EPC does not preclude the granting of a patent based on the main request (see above point 2.3.11), it is not possible to grant a patent without further examination in the situation discussed in 3.1 to 3.3, which can be carried out either by the Board itself or after remittal by the examining division in accordance with Article 111(1) EPC.

3.5 The appellant has indicated (statement of appeal, point II.2.2) that in this case, they would prefer a remittal of the matter to the examining division.

3.6 The Board considers it appropriate in the present case to grant the appellant the opportunity for examination over two instances. Since the examining division has not commented on the requirements according to Articles 54, 56, and 84 with respect to the present requests, the Board would otherwise have to conduct a comprehensive examination within the competence of the examining division, which would go far beyond the primary objective of the appeal proceedings to judicially review the contested decision (Article 12(2) RPBA). Should it be determined that none of the present requests are patentable, the appellant would then have no further appeal options available.

3.7 For these reasons, the Board has decided to remit the matter to the examining division for further processing.

3.8 In light of the facts mentioned in point 3.3, it is expected that at least the inventive step according to Article 56 EPC will need to be examined.

3.9 With respect to the requirements of Article 84 EPC and interpretation, it may need to be examined whether the present claims exclusively relate to a further medical use in the sense of Article 54(5) EPC (see page 10, lines 13 to 20 of the application regarding non-medical indications) and based on which technical features the desired therapeutic efficacy of hydrogen is achieved (where claim 1 of the main request in its current wording does not specify any particular health impairment or patient group and does not seem to stipulate either the route of administration (see above point 2.1.b) or dosage for the hydrogen to be applied).

4. Decision in Written Procedure

I. European Patent No. 2 138 154 was granted with 10 claims.

II. An opposition was filed against the grant of the patent. The grounds for opposition cited were lack of novelty and lack of inventive step (Article 100(a) EPC), insufficient disclosure (Article 100(b) EPC), and impermissible extension of content (Article 100(c) EPC).

III. The Opposition Division decided to maintain the patent in amended form based on the main request submitted on September 10, 2019.

IV. The following documents were cited inter alia in the decision of the Opposition Division:

D2: US 2006/0293213 A1

D5: JP H 05 271036 A

D5a: automatic translation of D5

D10: EP 1 772 136 A1

D11: WO 2016/026777 A1

V. The Opposition Division stated in its decision that the late-filed documents D10 and D11 submitted on November 20, 2020, were not to be admitted into the proceedings and that the main request met the requirements of Articles 123(2), 123(3), 83, 54, and 56 EPC.

VI. The Opponent (Appellant) filed an appeal against the above decision.

VII. In the response to the appeal dated November 15, 2021, the Patent Proprietor (Respondent) referred to the maintained claims as the main request and submitted five auxiliary requests.

The relevant independent claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

""1. Cosmetic hair treatment preparation intended for rinsing after application with amidoamines, 0.0001 to 1% active content of amphoteric surfactants and Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, wherein Coco Betaine is included as the amphoteric surfactant and Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine is used as the amidoamine.""

VIII. An oral hearing took place before the Board on December 12, 2023.

IX. The Appellant requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

Furthermore, it requested the admission of documents D10 and D11 submitted during the first-instance proceedings into the proceedings.

X. The Respondent requested the dismissal of the appeal, i.e., the maintenance of the patent in the form maintained by the Opposition Division (main request).

Furthermore, it requested that documents D10 and D11 not be admitted into the proceedings in accordance with the decision of the Opposition Division. Should document D10 be admitted into the proceedings, it requested that document D11 also be admitted.

XI. The relevant arguments of the Appellant for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) The Opposition Division did not exercise its discretion comprehensively in not admitting documents D10 and D11. Documents D10 and D11 should be admitted into the proceedings.

b) The main request violates Article 123(3) EPC. Claim 1 of the main request should be interpreted such that the claimed active content refers to the amphoteric surfactant and the specific Guar. According to the granted claim 1, this active content referred exclusively to the amphoteric surfactant. The scope of protection has thus been extended by now including compositions with less than 0.0001% active content of amphoteric surfactants.

c) The subject matter of the main request does not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. The latter now goes beyond the content of the original application since the function of the Guar has been omitted. Furthermore, if the interpretation of the present claim 1 of the Patent Proprietor is followed, there would be the possibility of an unlimited amount of Guar component in the composition. However, this amount was originally limited according to claim 7.

d) Document D10 is the closest prior art. The distinguishing feature lies in the presence of Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine. Only disadvantages regarding the viscosity of the preparation have been described for this component. The technical problem to be solved consists of providing an alternative hair treatment preparation. Document D5 describes the addition of Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine in such preparations. There is nothing to prevent a combination of the teachings of document D10 and document D5. Furthermore, document D2 discloses Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine as a commonly used component in hair treatment preparations. Finally, document D11 teaches that the Cocamide MIPA component from document D10 is a chemical analogue of an amidoamine such as Coco Betaine. Thus, the subject matter of the main request does not involve an inventive step.

The skilled person would arrive at the same conclusion starting from document D2 as the closest prior art. The distinguishing feature would then be the active content of amidoamine and the presence of Coco Betaine and Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride. An effect resulting from this is not credibly demonstrated across the entire breadth of claim 1. The technical problem to be solved consists of providing an alternative hair treatment preparation. The addition of common components such as the Coco Betaine component used in document D10 in a cosmetic preparation is obvious.

XII. The relevant arguments of the Respondent for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) Documents D10 and D11 were submitted late and are not prima facie relevant for the question of inventive step. They should therefore not be admitted into the proceedings.

b) Claim 1 of the main request should be interpreted such that the claimed active content continues to refer exclusively to the amphoteric surfactant. The addition of the Guar component does not constitute a violation of Article 123(3).

c) The main request meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. Claim 1 of the main request is based on original claims, in particular claim 7. Since Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride is per se a cationic polymer, the omission of the term ""as a cationic polymer"" from original claim 7 is meaningless. Furthermore, the objection of the Appellant under Article 123(2) EPC regarding the amount of Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride should not be admitted into the proceedings.

d) The subject matter of the main request meets the requirements of Article 56 EPC. Document D2 is the closest prior art. The distinguishing feature lies in the active content of amidoamine and the presence of Coco Betaine and Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride. The comparative tests of the patent demonstrate that the addition of Coco Betaine allows for a reduction in the increase of viscosity upon storage. This effect is not disclosed or suggested in any of the prior art documents.

The skilled person would arrive at the same conclusion starting from document D10 as the closest prior art. The distinguishing feature lies in the presence of Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine. The cited prior art does not suggest the addition of this component in the preparations of document D10. In particular, the skilled person would not have combined the teachings of documents D10 and D5. Furthermore, such a combination would not have led to the present invention.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Admission of Evidence

1.1 The documents D10 and D11 submitted by the Opponent in the opposition proceedings after the expiry of the opposition period were submitted during the period according to Rule 116(1) EPC.

The admission of these documents was specifically discussed in the opposition proceedings. According to the contested decision, documents D10 and D11 were not admitted into the opposition proceedings based on the criterion of apparent relevance.

1.2 Document D10

1.2.1 The Board notes that the Opposition Division extensively discussed the content of document D10 in comparison to document D2 in its exercise of discretion regarding the admission of document D10 (see point 25.5.2 of the Opposition Division's decision). The Opposition Division derived the lack of apparent relevance from its conclusion that document D10 would not represent the closest prior art (see point 21 of the Opposition Division's decision). The Board is of the opinion that the relevance as the closest prior art goes beyond the framework of apparent relevance when compared to further documents. The fact that the Appellant used document D10 as the closest prior art in its arguments does not imply that the admission of this document would be conditional upon this.

1.2.2 The Board further notes that, as argued by the Appellant, document D10 was submitted in response to the inclusion of an additional component (namely Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride) in the preparation of claim 1 of the main request. Document D10 indeed relates to shampoos containing Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, i.e., compositions in the same technical field that feature the newly introduced component. Consequently, document D10 meets the criterion of apparent relevance.

1.2.3 During the oral proceedings, the Respondent first argued in the appeal proceedings that the additional Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride component was already listed in dependent claim 5 of the granted patent. The inclusion of this feature in claim 1 of the amended main request during the opposition proceedings was thus predictable. Document D10 should therefore have been submitted with the notice of opposition.

The Board notes that an Opponent cannot generally be expected to submit all possible evidence for all possible fallback positions of a Patent Proprietor. In the present case, there was consequently no particular reason to submit this document earlier in the opposition proceedings.

1.2.4 Accordingly, the Opposition Division's decision not to admit document D10 was a misuse of discretion. The Board thus admits document D10 into the appeal proceedings (Article 12(6) RPBA 2020, first sentence, first part).

1.3 Document D11

Following the admission of document D10, both parties request the admission of document D11. The circumstances of the appeal case therefore justify the admission of document D11 into the appeal proceedings (Article 12(6) RPBA 2020, first sentence, second part).

Main Request

2. Amendments

2.1 Interpretation of the Claim

2.1.1 The arguments of the parties regarding the amendment of claim 1 of the main request were based on different interpretations of the claim. The interpretation of this claim is thus crucial for assessing the admissibility of the amendment made.

2.1.2 According to the Appellant, the claimed active content now refers not only to the amphoteric surfactant, as originally disclosed, but also to the added specific Guar. The Appellant argued, among other things, that considering the generally poor grammatical formulation of the claim, the broadest possible interpretation should be applied. The Respondent, on the other hand, argued that claim 1 of the main request defines a listing of three independent features, with it being clear that the claimed active content only pertains to the surfactant.

2.1.3 The Board is of the opinion that the use of a comma to list the first two components, followed by the use of the conjunction ""and"" before the last component, indeed represents a listing of three individual components. Consequently, the claimed active content is to be understood as exclusively referring to the amphoteric surfactant.

2.1.4 Regarding the description (cf. Article 69(1), second sentence EPC), the following should be noted: in paragraphs [0015] and [0017] of the patent specification, separate content indications for surfactants and for Guar are made, with the active content for surfactants corresponding to the claimed content. This disclosure confirms the interpretation considered by the Board. Contrary to the Appellant's opinion, the fact that the claimed surfactant and Guar are disclosed in consecutive sections of the description, but without a clear link between the paragraphs, does not provide evidence that surfactant and Guar are to be understood as a unit.

2.2 Article 123(3) EPC

The Appellant's arguments regarding Article 123(3) EPC were based solely on its interpretation of claim 1 of the main request. Based on the interpretation considered by the Board, the scope of protection has been clearly restricted by the presence of an additional component compared to the granted claim. Thus, the subject matter of the main request meets the requirements of Article 123(3) EPC.

2.3 Article 123(2) EPC

2.3.1 Claim 1 of the main request is based on a combination of original claims 1, 2 (specific surfactant), 5 (specific amidoamine), and 7 (specific Guar).

2.3.2 The Appellant argued that the component ""Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride"" in the original application (in particular in original claim 7) only occurs together with the characterizing attribute ""as a cationic polymer."" This attribute provides technical information regarding the function of the Guar. By omitting the characterizing attribute, this information has been altered in a way that cannot be derived from the original application.

According to the Appellant, for example, an additionally anionically modified Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride could be considered an equivalent and thus still referred to as Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride according to claim 1 of the main request. However, such a zwitterionic or amphoteric polymer would no longer fall under the term Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride ""as a cationic polymer"" according to the original application.

The Appellant further explained that Guar polymers are known to the skilled person in various functions such as viscosity regulators, surfactants, film formers, emulsion stabilizers, or antistatic agents. By omitting the function, a shift in the possible functions occurs.

2.3.3 These arguments are not convincing. The claimed Guar refers to a specific product that per se corresponds to a cationic polymer. The definition ""cationic polymer"" does not represent a functional definition in the sense that it would restrict the claimed product to a limited number of possible uses. This definition merely characterizes an intrinsic structural property, the omission of which does not change the claimed subject matter. Claim 1 of the main request is clearly limited to this specific product. The Board is therefore of the opinion that a hypothetically additionally anionically modified Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, according to the Appellant's argument, represents a different product.

2.3.4 During the oral proceedings, the Appellant argued for the first time in the appeal proceedings that, should the interpretation of claim 1 by the Appellant be followed, an unlimited amount of Guar component could be present in the composition. However, original claim 6 defined a specific amount for the cationic polymer. Due to the dependency of original claim 7 on the preceding claim, the amount of Guar component in the composition was originally limited.

The Respondent requested that this new objection be considered late and not admitted into the proceedings.

As the only justification for the late presentation of this argument, the Appellant stated that it was not raised in the notice of opposition because the said amendment in the main request had not yet been made. However, the Board notes that this objection should have been raised at the latest with the statement of grounds of appeal. The Appellant has thus not provided valid reasons that extraordinary circumstances exist which could justify the admission of this argument presented only during the oral proceedings.

The Board therefore does not admit the objection under Article 123(2) EPC regarding the amount of Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride into the proceedings (Article 13(2) RPBA).

2.3.5 Consequently, the subject matter of the main request meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

3. Sufficient Disclosure and Novelty

3.1 The Appellant did not pursue its objections under Article 83 EPC and Article 54 EPC in the appeal proceedings.

3.2 The Board is of the opinion that the requirements of these articles do not preclude the maintenance of the present main request.

4. Inventive Step

4.1 Closest Prior Art

4.1.1 The objective of the contested patent is to reduce the time-dependent increase in viscosity of hair treatment preparations containing amidoamines (see, for example, paragraph [0014] of the patent). For this purpose, Coco Betaine is added to the preparations (see, for example, paragraphs [0015] and [0016] of the patent).

4.1.2 The Respondent considered document D2 as the closest prior art while the Appellant preferred document D10.

4.1.3 Both documents, D2 and D10, relate to the same technical field as the present patent, namely rinse-off hair treatment products. However, neither D2 nor D10 explicitly addresses the increase in viscosity of the preparations during storage due to the amidoamine component. Document D2 merely describes the use of thickeners to achieve an acceptable viscosity (see paragraph [0059]). Document D10 does not mention the viscosity of the final preparations and only discloses that they should remain ""cosmetically acceptable"" (see, for example, paragraphs [0004] and [0007]).

4.1.4 As highlighted by the Appellant, document D10 discloses in the examples preparations that contain two of the three claimed components (namely Coco Betaine and Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride; see examples 13 to 16), while the preparation of the closest example from document D2 contains only the amidoamine among the claimed components (namely Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine; see example 12). However, the core component of the preparations according to document D2 is an amidoamine, i.e., the same as in the contested patent. In contrast, the core component in document D10 consists of a polymer dispersion.

4.1.5 The Board is of the opinion that in the present case, considering the objective of the contested patent, the preparations with the same core component, i.e., from document D2, should primarily be considered. However, document D10 also represents a somewhat suitable starting point. It is established case law that when the skilled person has several different documents available that could lead to the invention, the rationale of the problem-solution approach requires the invention to be examined in relation to all these paths before it can be attributed an inventive step (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 10th edition, 2022, I.D.3.1, 6th paragraph).

4.1.6 Thus, the inventive step will be assessed below based on both document D2 and document D10.

4.2 Document D2 as Closest Prior Art

Difference

4.2.1 It was undisputed that the subject matter of the present main request differs from the closest preparation from document D2 (example 12) by the active content of amidoamine and the presence of Coco Betaine and Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride.

Technical Effect

4.2.2 The examples of the patent demonstrate that the addition of Coco Betaine to hair treatment preparations containing Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine and Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride reduces the increase in viscosity during storage for 180 days.

4.2.3 The Appellant objected that there are no direct comparative tests against example 12 from document D2. However, comparative tests were conducted in the contested patent (see paragraphs [0022] to [0024], Tables 1 and 2). Formulas 5 (according to the invention) and 4 (comparative formula) as well as formulas 2 (according to the invention) and 1 (comparative formula) differ from each other solely in the addition of Coco Betaine. These comparative tests are therefore suitable to demonstrate a technical effect of the distinguishing feature. The Coco Betaine-containing preparations (Formula 5 and Formula 2) show a reduction in the increase in viscosity after 180 days.

4.2.4 During the oral proceedings, the Appellant argued for the first time in the appeal proceedings that Cocamidopropyl Betaine could be understood as encompassed by the term Coco Betaine. Since a preparation that additionally contains Cocamidopropyl Betaine is used as a source of Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride in the example formulas of the patent, it is questionable whether Formula 1 is actually suitable for a comparative test and whether Formula 2 even has a compliant content (below 1%) of Coco Betaine. Finally, in Formula 3, Cocamidopropyl Betaine was added instead of Coco Betaine compared to Formula 1. Since the content of Coco Betaine and Cocamidopropyl Betaine in Formula 2 or Formula 3, as well as the corresponding viscosity after 180 days of the respective formulas, differ, the alleged effect is not solely attributable to the addition of Coco Betaine but also to the amount of the added component. Consequently, the purported effect has not been credibly demonstrated across the entire breadth of the claim.

4.2.5 The Respondent requested that these arguments be considered late and not admitted into the proceedings. The Appellant countered that this is purely a factual examination, namely whether the patent credibly demonstrates the alleged effect or not.

4.2.6 The Board notes that these arguments of the Appellant are entirely new and concern facts that have been present in unchanged form since the beginning of the opposition proceedings. The results of the examples of the patent have not been questioned in either the opposition or the appeal proceedings and were considered accepted. Furthermore, the necessity of examining the inventive step based on document D2 as the closest prior art has already been noted in the decision of the Opposition Division as well as in the present opinion of the Board of Appeal.

4.2.7 The arguments presented thus represent a change in the Appellant's submissions, the admission of which is to be assessed according to Article 13(2) RPBA. The Appellant has not provided valid reasons that extraordinary circumstances exist for the late presentation of these new arguments.

4.2.8 These newly presented arguments of the Appellant regarding the experiments in the patent are therefore not admitted into the appeal proceedings.

Objective Technical Problem

4.2.9 Consequently, the objective technical problem starting from document D2 is to provide a hair treatment preparation containing Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine for rinsing that shows a reduction in the increase in viscosity during storage.

Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

4.2.10 None of the cited documents explicitly discloses an effect of Coco Betaine on the increase in viscosity. The Appellant's arguments related to the provision of an alternative preparation. The fact that Coco Betaine is a common ingredient in hair treatment preparations is not sufficient on its own to provide the skilled person with an obvious solution to the present problem. Without any indication that Coco Betaine could reduce the increase in viscosity during storage, the skilled person would not have arrived at the present solution without exercising inventive activity.

4.3 Document D10 as Closest Prior Art

Difference

4.3.1 It was undisputed that the subject matter of the present main request differs from the closest preparations of document D10 (see examples 13 to 16) by the presence of Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine.

Technical Effect

4.3.2 No particular technical effect was presented by the Respondent for this distinguishing feature.

Objective Technical Problem

4.3.3 Consequently, the objective technical problem starting from document D10 is to provide an alternative hair treatment preparation for rinsing.

Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

4.3.4 The Appellant stated that the skilled person would have found an alternative to the preparations of document D10 in document D5. Document D5 discloses the use of amidoamines, including Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine (see D5a, paragraphs [0002] and [0005]). This specific compound is furthermore a commonly used component in shampoos and conditioners (see, for example, D2, example 12). The problem of stability over time is also described in D5 (see D5a, paragraph [0002]), and Betaine is proposed as a solution. However, these are already included in the compositions of document D10, so the skilled person would not have expected any disadvantages when incorporating amidoamines into these compositions. The addition of amidoamines to the preparations of document D10 would therefore be obvious.

4.3.5 The Appellant additionally argued that the compositions of document D10 contained Cocamide MIPA, i.e., Cocamid from Monoisopropanol. Document D11 shows that this component is a chemical analogue of an amidoamine (see D11, page 11, line 32 to page 12, line 2 and page 12, lines 26 ff.). It would therefore have also seemed obvious to the skilled person to replace the Cocamide MIPA component with an amidoamine from document D5 in the preparations of document D10.

4.3.6 These arguments are not convincing.

4.3.7 As pointed out by the Respondent, the skilled person would not have found any reason to combine the teachings of documents D5 and D10.

On the one hand, the objective in document D5 is to provide a hair treatment preparation with improved properties. This objective is achieved by the addition of a combination of four components, namely (A) amidoamine, (B) amphoteric surfactant, (C) alcohol with 16-24 carbon atoms, and (D) organic acid (see D5a, paragraph [0003], ""Means for solving the problems""). It is further described that the preparations according to the invention should have a pH of 2 to 4.5 (see D5a, paragraph [0008]).

On the other hand, the compositions of document D10 contain neither an amidoamine nor an alcohol with 16-24 carbons. Furthermore, in the examples of document D10, the pH is only adjusted to a value of 6.5 using citric acid or sodium hydroxide. An organic acid as a component per se is not disclosed.

In this context, the Appellant argued that document D5 generally defines a weakly acidic preparation (see D5a, paragraph [0008]). A pH of 6.5, as in the preparations of document D10, would be recognized by the skilled person as slightly acidic. Therefore, the different specific pH values would not prevent a combination of the teachings of both documents.

This argument is not convincing on its own because document D5 does not provide such a general teaching. The relevant paragraph (see D5a, paragraph [0008]) equates a weakly acidic preparation within the scope of the disclosed invention with a pH of 2 to 4.5 (""is preferably weak acidity, and is pH 2 to 4.5""), which clearly excludes a value of 6.5.

The Board is therefore of the opinion that the skilled person would not have combined the teachings of document D5 with the preparations of D10, which contain different components and have a different pH.

4.3.8 Furthermore, the Board agrees with the Respondent that even if the skilled person had combined the teachings of both documents, they would have used the aminoamides employed in the examples of document D5. Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine is indeed not preferred in document D5 and is only mentioned in a list of possible aminoamides. The fact that Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine was used in D2 (see example 12) is irrelevant in this context, as D5 does not refer to D2. Furthermore, the Board notes that D2, as an isolated patent document, cannot represent a general teaching. Additionally, document D2 relates to conditioner preparations, while document D10 discloses shampoo preparations. The skilled person would therefore not have combined specific examples from both documents.

4.3.9 Finally, document D11 cannot be considered for the assessment of inventive step.

Document D11 is relevant prior art according to Article 54(3) EPC (cf. Article 56, second sentence EPC). Furthermore, it is not suitable to demonstrate common knowledge as of the priority date for the following reasons:

a) individual patent documents generally do not serve as evidence of common knowledge,

b) the cited paragraphs from document D11 (see page 11, line 32 to page 12, line 2 and paragraph from page 12, line 26) do not relate to the general description of prior art or general common knowledge prior to the priority date of D11, but disclose specific embodiments of the invention.

The Board additionally notes that the cited paragraphs from document D11 do not provide evidence for the Appellant's arguments. Contrary to the Appellant's opinion, both components are not generally referred to as ""equivalents"" or ""analogues"" but as elements of different classes of components (alkanolamide and amidoamine).

4.3.10 Consequently, the Respondent's argumentation is based on a retrospective view. Starting from document D10, the skilled person would not have arrived at the present solution without exercising inventive activity.

4.4 The Board thus concludes that the subject matter of the main request meets the requirements of Article 56 EPC.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",the patent has been granted,the patent has been granted,appeal dismissed,Henkel AG & Co.

I. The appeal of the appellant (opponent) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to maintain the contested patent in amended form under Article 101(3)(a) EPC.

II. The appellant filed an opposition against the grant of the patent under Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty and inventive step, and under Article 100(c) EPC for unauthorized amendments.

III. In its decision, the opposition division concluded that the granted patent contained unauthorized amendments and could therefore not be maintained in its granted form. In contrast, the amended version of the patent in the form of auxiliary request 1 did not go beyond the content of the original application or the parent application, Articles 76(1) and 123(2) EPC, and the claimed compositions were based on inventive step starting from D2 as the closest prior art.

- y is equal to 1 or 2, and

- X is a physiologically acceptable organic or inorganic anion.""

Additionally, claim 10 also claims a method for reductive decolorization of dyed substrates in which these compositions are used.

VI. The appellant argued in its statement of grounds of appeal that claim 1 of the amended version of the patent contained unauthorized amendments compared to the original content of the parent or divisional application and was therefore not patentable under Articles 76(1) or 123(2) EPC. Furthermore, the compositions claimed in claim 1 did not involve an inventive step over D2, Article 56 EPC.

The appellant requested that the decision of the opposition division be overturned and the patent be revoked. Alternatively, it requested the scheduling of oral proceedings.

VII. The respondent (patent proprietor) defended the decision of the opposition division in its response to the appeal.

The respondent requested that the appeal be dismissed. Alternatively, it requested the scheduling of oral proceedings.

Furthermore, it also requested, as an alternative, to maintain the patent based on the auxiliary request 1 submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal, which corresponds to auxiliary request 2 from the opposition proceedings.

VIII. The board summoned the parties to oral proceedings as requested, scheduled for September 19, 2023. A communication under Article 15(1) RPBA was issued on June 14, 2023. In it, the board provisionally concluded that the appeal should be dismissed.

IX. In a letter dated June 30, 2023, the appellant informed the board that it would not attend the oral proceedings.

X. The oral proceedings were subsequently canceled by the board.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. The decision in the written procedure is permissible. The appellant's announcement not to participate in the oral proceedings scheduled in accordance with Article 116 EPC can only be understood as a withdrawal of their auxiliary request for such a hearing. The auxiliary request of the respondent, on the other hand, was made on the condition that the Board would not reject the appeal.

Both parties had the opportunity to express their views on the relevant issues in the written appeal procedure, Article 113(1) EPC.

3. Amendments, Article 123(2) and 76(1) EPC

3.1 The contested patent originates from a divisional application. The parent application as originally filed and published is referred to as D1 in the proceedings. The appellant argued that the amendments made in claim 1 of the version of the patent maintained by the opposition division led to a new selection from the subject matter originally disclosed in the parent application or the divisional application.

The contested selection steps consist of:

i) selecting keratin fibers from the described options for the intended purpose,

ii) restricting the remainder R of the compounds defined in the claim to the formula (II),

iii) limiting the remainder R**(2) contained in the remainder R to the options listed in the claim, and finally

iv) combining the resulting compounds with the quaternary ammonium salt of the formula (Q1-c).

3.2 However, the amendments made do not go beyond the content of the original disclosure. For the original disclosure, reference is made to the published parent application D1, which contains a disclosure identical to that of the originally filed divisional application.

The definition of the sulfinic acids (I) in claim 1 of D1 was restricted to the substructure (II) according to original claim 4. Furthermore, some meanings were removed from the definition of the remainder R**(2) contained in this structure. These deletions do not add anything to the original disclosure. The scope of the claim was only restricted to a smaller group of sulfinic acids. Moreover, the 2-hydroxy-2-sulfinessigsaure, which is highlighted in the description and used as the only sulfinic acid derivative in the examples, falls under the modified definition of formula (I).

Quaternary ammonium salts of the formula (Q1-c), characterized by (C8- to C30-) alkyl groups, are mentioned in original claim 9 as one of four options for quaternary ammonium salts. Furthermore, a salt falling under this definition, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, is used in the examples, also in combination with the previously described sulfinic acids, see for example example E2.

Thus, the changes made compared to the original claims are restrictions towards preferred embodiments, which are also supported by the original examples. This does not go beyond the original disclosure. The restrictions also do not lead to specific combinations of features that were not originally disclosed.

The restriction of the intended purpose to the use for reductive color removal of keratin fibers also does not go beyond the original disclosure. That the means for treating keratin fibers, particularly hair, must be suitable is evident from original claims 17 and 22 and is also mentioned in the very first paragraph of the description, or in the first two paragraphs on page 4, which describe the problem posed and its solution. Furthermore, the examples also refer to the treatment of hair.

3.3 Therefore, the amended version of the patent does not contain any unlawful amendments.

4. Inventive Step, Article 56 EPC

4.1 The patent deals with compositions for reductive color removal, particularly on hair, i.e., the removal of dyes resulting in the lightening of hair, see paragraph [0006]. In this context, particular emphasis is placed on a permanent decolorization without re-darkening, see page 3, lines 14-23.

4.2 The closest prior art is undisputedly D2, which also describes compositions for reductive color removal. In particular, the compositions of D2 contain as reducing agents the 2-hydroxy-2-sulfinessigsaure used in the contested patent, see page 7, lines 4-15. This is also used in examples 1 and 2.

4.3 The difference of the present claims compared to D2 lies in the additional use of the longer-chain quaternary ammonium salts (Q1-c). While D2 mentions cationic surfactants as possible additives in the decolorizing solutions described there and also generally mentions tetraalkylammonium chlorides or bromides (page 76, line 30 to page 77, line 3), the longer-chain salts defined in the present claim are not mentioned. The examples of D2 do not use cationic surfactants.

This fact was undisputed.

4.4 The appellant particularly contests in their appeal the finding of the opposition division that the use of the salts (Q1-c) leads to an improvement in the decolorizing effect compared to the teaching of D2.

4.4.1 To demonstrate this effect, the opposition division relied significantly on the test results described in D5, which the patent owner submitted during the opposition proceedings. According to these results, the use of the claimed quaternary ammonium salts, namely dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, leads to improved color lightening compared to the use of simple tetrapropylammonium chloride, which was chosen as a comparative compound representing the tetraalkylammonium chlorides generally described in D2. This improved effect was demonstrated by determining the color distance DeltaE and brightness DeltaL.

4.4.2 The appellant argued that the sole determination of the values for DeltaE and DeltaL does not indicate whether a stronger decolorization actually occurs.

The respondent argued that the parameter DeltaL is a measure of the brightness of the color tone; a higher value corresponds to a lighter strand color. The color distance DeltaE is a measure of how much color has been removed. This argument corresponds to the generally accepted color metrics; the opposition division saw it the same way. The Board sees no reason to doubt this.

That in individual cases the difference may not be very pronounced, as the appellant pointed out in the case of the dye ""chocolate brown,"" does not change the generally demonstrated tendency towards an improvement in the decolorizing effect.

The argument presented by the appellant with reference to D4 and the example of the patent that the claimed ammonium salts show no improvement over other cationic surfactants is equally unconvincing. Even if this were true, an improved effect must fundamentally be demonstrated compared to the structurally closest disclosure of the prior art. In this case, these are the tetraalkylammonium salts mentioned in D2. Whether and how the properties change compared to other structurally more distantly related additives also described in D2 is irrelevant.

4.4.3 Therefore, the finding of the opposition division that the claimed compositions exhibit an improved effect compared to the structurally closest compositions of D2 is ultimately confirmed.

4.5 Accordingly, the claimed subject matter starting from D2 solves the technical problem of providing compositions with an improved decolorizing effect.

The appellant has not presented any arguments as to why the skilled person should have resorted to the compounds defined in the claim (Q1-c) in expectation of an improvement starting from D2. The arguments of the appellant are limited to the assertion that the addition of the compounds (Q1-c) starting from D2 would have been obvious as an alternative to the compositions described in D2. Even if this assessment by the appellant were correct, it would not have helped the skilled person in their search for a solution to the posed problem. That the addition of the compounds Q1-c would lead to improved results or even just influence the decolorizing effect is nowhere suggested in the prior art.

4.6 The claimed solution to the above-defined technical problem was therefore not suggested to the skilled person by the prior art. The claimed compositions are based on inventive activity.

5. In summary, it can be stated that the decision of the opposition division is not to be criticized.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,appeal dismissed,L'OREAL,L'OREAL 14 rue Royale 75008 Paris / FR,"L'Oreal Service D.I.P.I. 9, rue Pierre Dreyfus 92110 Clichy / FR",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeal of the opponent is directed against the decision of the Opposition Division to reject the opposition against European Patent No. EP 2 640 694 under Article 101(2) EPC.

II. An opposition was filed against the grant of the patent based on Article 100 a) EPC for lack of novelty (Article 54 EPC) and lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC), Article 100 b) EPC for lack of sufficiency of disclosure, and Article 100 c) EPC for inadmissible amendments.

III. The Opposition Division concluded in its decision that claim 1 of the contested patent was not unallowably amended during the grant procedure. Furthermore, the claimed subject matter is disclosed in a manner sufficiently clear for the skilled person. Finally, the process according to claim 1 is novel (Article 54 EPC) and involves an inventive step (Article 56 EPC). The Opposition Division considered document D2 to be the closest prior art in agreement with the parties.

IV. According to the appellant (opponent), the decision of the Opposition Division is erroneous in that it recognized an inventive step. The grounds for opposition under Article 100 a) in conjunction with Article 54 EPC, as well as under Article 100 b) and c) EPC were not pursued further in the appeal proceedings.

V. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the Board informed the parties of its preliminary view of the legal and factual situation. In particular, it informed the parties that the admission of documents D13 and D14, which were submitted only in the appeal proceedings, was not to be expected, and that consequently, the rejection of the appeal was likely.

VI. An oral hearing took place on December 5, 2023, in the form of a video conference. At the end of the hearing, the decision was announced.

VII. The following documents were referred to in the proceedings:

D2:    US 2007/0117997 A1

D14c:  WO 2010/095927 A1

VIII. Claim 1 of the present main request (patent in the granted form) has the following wording:

""Process for the production of methylenediphenyldiisocyanate comprising the following steps:

a) Phosgenation of two- and/or multi-phenylmethylenediamine to obtain two- and/or multi-phenylmethylenediisocyanate,

b) Separation of the crude methylenediphenyldiisocyanate to obtain at least one mixture M containing two-core isomers of methylenediphenyldiisocyanate and at least one mixture P containing oligomeric methylenediphenyldiisocyanate,

c) Purification and/or separation of at least one mixture M to obtain at least one further mixture F containing at least one compound selected from 2,2'-methylenediphenyldiisocyanate, 2,4'-methylenediphenyldiisocyanate, and 4,4'-methylenediphenyldiisocyanate, and

d) Storing the mixture or mixtures F obtained in step (c) and the mixture P obtained in step (b) for a period of at least 1 day at a temperature of 5°C to 60°C,

characterized in that a part of at least one of the stored mixtures F and/or P is reintroduced into at least one of the steps (b) or (c), wherein the reintroduction of the stored mixtures F and/or P occurs at a location where the temperature and residence time are such that the cleavage of uretdione units into isocyanate units occurs.""

IX. In her statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

The documents D13 and D14 submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal should be admitted into the appeal proceedings. They represent a direct response to the contested decision and could therefore not have been submitted earlier. They are prima facie relevant as they show that the distinguishing features cited in the decision were known to the skilled person from the closest prior art. This demonstrates that the provision of the claimed process does not involve an inventive step.

The presence of an inventive step should also be denied both starting from document D14 as the closest prior art and solely considering document D2.

Document D14 was published before the priority date of the contested patent, as evidenced by documents D14a, D14b, and D14c.

X. In her response to the statement of grounds of appeal and in the further proceedings, the respondent essentially argued as follows:

Documents D13 and D14 were submitted late. They are not prima facie relevant and should therefore not be admitted into the appeal proceedings. The appellant has not conclusively proven that D14 was published before the priority date of the contested patent. Furthermore, neither the argumentation based on document D14 as the closest prior art regarding inventive step should be admitted, nor the argumentation presented solely during the oral proceedings based on the disclosure of document D2.

XI. The final requests of the parties are as follows:

The appellant (opponent) requests the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

The respondent (patent proprietor) requests that the appeal be dismissed and thus the patent be maintained in the granted version. She also requests that the documents D13, D14, as well as D14a, D14b, and D14c submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal not be admitted into the proceedings.","Reasons for the Decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

Documents D13, D14, D14a, D14b, D14c - Admission

2. The documents D13 and D14 were submitted by the appellant together with the statement of grounds for appeal and their admission was requested. The respondent requests that the documents not be admitted into the appeal proceedings due to late submission and lack of relevance.

3. The Board comes to the following conclusion:

3.1 The basis of the appeal proceedings is governed by Article 12 of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPBA). According to Article 12(2) RPBA, the primary objective of the appeal proceedings is to review the contested decision judicially. Therefore, the submissions of the parties in the appeal must relate to the requests, facts, objections, arguments, and evidence underlying the contested decision.

3.2 This does not apply to documents D13 and D14, nor to the arguments based on them. Therefore, this submission constitutes a change within the meaning of Article 12(4) RPBA. It is at the discretion of the Board to admit this submission (Article 12(4), sentence 1, RPBA). According to Article 12(6), second sentence, RPBA, the Board does not admit requests, facts, objections, or evidence that should have been presented in the proceedings leading to the contested decision or that were no longer maintained, unless the circumstances of the appeal case justify admission.

As explained below, documents D13 and D14 should have been presented already in the opposition proceedings. Furthermore, there are no circumstances in the appeal case that justify the admission of the documents.

3.3 By submitting document D14, the appellant initially addresses what they believe to be the erroneous view of the opposition division, which states that while the recycling of certain by-product streams within a production process is known from the prior art, the recycling of stored end products is not. On the other hand, by submitting document D13, they address what they believe to be the erroneous view of the opposition division regarding the occurrence of dimers during storage according to step (d) of the claimed process.

Document D13

3.4 As presented by the appellant, document D13 discloses that the formation of insoluble residues during the storage of 4,4'-MDI under suitable storage conditions can be reduced (see claim 1 and lines 5 to 10 and 34 to 37 of column 2). However, this was not disputed in the contested decision. In this respect, the submission of document D13 in the appeal proceedings cannot be regarded as a response to an argument raised only in the contested decision.

Document D14

3.5 As presented by the appellant, the opposition division stated in its decision that the recycling of product streams is generally common in modern process engineering. The opposition division also states in its decision that this should be distinguished from the recycling of a product that has already been formed. However, there is no indication of this in document D2 (see in particular page 9, paragraph 4).

3.6 Document D14 cannot refute this finding. The document discloses, as presented by the appellant, the recycling of PMDI or MDI-containing streams in a process for the phosgenation of methylenediphenyldiamine (see in particular figure 1 on page 2). However, this does not involve the recycling of a part ""of at least one of the stored mixtures F and/or P,"" in the sense of claim 1 of the patent in dispute, particularly not after they have been stored according to the claim for a period of at least 1 day at a temperature of 5°C to 60°C.

Claimed Recycling of Mixture ""F""

3.7 Mixture ""F"" according to claim 1 of the main request is obtained according to step (c) of the claimed process after purification and/or separation of the mixture ""M"" obtained in step (b). Mixture ""F"" contains at least one compound chosen from the 2,2'-, 2,4'- and 4,4'-isomers of methylenediphenyldiisocyanate.

3.8 Although document D14 also recycles a mixture containing 4,4'-MDI (see ""Recycle 4,4'-MDI ~80%"" in figure 1), this does not involve the recycling of a mixture ""F"" according to claim 1, which was obtained by purifying a mixture ""M"" containing dibasic isomers of methylenediisocyanate according to claim 1, but rather it is a mixture that is depleted in 4,4'-content. It contains 4,4'-MDI at only ~80%, compared to > 95% of the mixture fed into the crystallization unit. Thus, this is the recycling of the mother liquor generated during crystallization. The obtained 4,4'-MDI, however, is stored (see D14, page 4, paragraph 5), but not recycled.

3.9 The appellant pointed out that according to document D14, intermediate storage could also occur. Although document D14 indeed refers to the possibility of intermediate storage in the penultimate point of the left column on page 2, this section does not refer to the intermediate storage of a purified and/or separated mixture containing 4,4'-MDI, but apparently to a mixture already obtained, namely that generated after the pre-distillation (""Crude MDI Distillation Unit""), where, analogous to step (b) of granted claim 1, a separation of MDI and PMDI occurs.

3.10 Therefore, document D14 does not disclose the recycling of a mixture ""F"" stored under the conditions required by claim 1 of the main request.

Claimed Recycling of Mixture ""P""

3.11 Mixture ""P"" according to claim 1 of the main request is a mixture obtained according to step (b) by separating the crude methylenediphenyldiisocyanate formed after phosgenation, and which contains oligomeric methylenediphenyldiisocyanate.

3.12 Document D14 discloses in figure 1 the recycling of a mixture from a unit referred to as ""Residue Processing."" This mixture contains PMDI. According to the right column on page 3, the MDI obtained from the ""residue stream"" after distillation is recycled as feed into the pre-distillation (""Crude MDI Distillation Unit""). Thus, this does not involve the recycling of a mixture ""F"" or ""P"" stored under the conditions required by claim 1 of the main request.

3.13 Therefore, document D14 is not suitable for addressing the issue of recycling stored end products under certain conditions as mentioned in point 3.3 of this decision.

3.14 The appellant's submission is therefore not suitable to demonstrate that the documents could not have been submitted earlier. Documents D13 and D14 do not address the arguments of the opposition division in its decision, but rather aim to support the arguments of the appellant regarding lack of inventive step that were already presented at the beginning of the opposition proceedings. They should have been submitted in the opposition proceedings.

3.15 Furthermore, the appellant did not demonstrate that there are circumstances in the appeal case that justify the admission of the documents into the appeal proceedings. The Board also cannot identify such circumstances. Rather, the issue of recycling stored 4,4'-MDI and the formation of dimers during storage has been addressed by the appellant since the beginning of the opposition proceedings (opposition statement, pages 7 to 10), and was discussed both by the respondent (response to the opposition statement, page 5) and by the opposition division prior to the oral proceedings (communication of June 4, 2020, pages 4 to 5). Therefore, documents D13 and D14 should have been submitted earlier for this reason as well.

3.16 The Board therefore does not admit documents D13 and D14 into the appeal proceedings (Article 12(6) RPBA).

3.17 Documents D14a, D14b, and D14c were submitted by the appellant to prove the publication date of document D14. However, since document D14 is not admitted into the appeal proceedings for other reasons (see above), the publication date is irrelevant, and there is therefore no reason to admit documents D14a, D14b, and D14c without document D14.

Main Request (Patent in Granted Form)

Inventive Step (Article 100(a) and 56 EPC)

4. The appellant did not argue in the appeal proceedings how the opposition division's decision regarding the presence of an inventive step based on the technical teaching of document D2 in combination with other documents already submitted in the opposition proceedings is erroneous. Initially, they only raised a lack of inventive step based on document D2 in conjunction with document D14, which was submitted only at the beginning of the appeal proceedings. Another objection was raised, which is based on document D14 as the closest prior art. Finally, the appellant argued that inventive step is not given even solely based on document D2. They requested that this additional line of attack be admitted in the oral proceedings and presented in detail.

5. Document D14 is not admitted into the proceedings for the reasons mentioned above. The arguments based on this document are therefore already not conclusive for this reason, regardless of whether D14 is considered in combination with D2 as the closest prior art or whether D14 itself is regarded as the closest prior art. Furthermore, the appellant's argumentation is directed at claim 1 of the main request, i.e., the patent in granted form. Therefore, it should have been presented at the beginning of the opposition proceedings. The arguments raised only with the statement of grounds for appeal are therefore not admissible (Article 12(6) RPBA).

6. The appellant's argument regarding a lack of inventive step based solely on the disclosure of document D2 was first presented during the oral proceedings before the Board. This was not disputed by the appellant. The respondent requested the non-admission of this submission.

7. According to Article 13(2) RPBA, a change in the appeal submissions of a party at this stage of the proceedings is generally not considered unless there are exceptional circumstances.

8. The appellant argued that document D2 had already been discussed extensively during the proceedings, it had already been the subject of the contested decision, and was therefore known to both the appellant and the Board. However, the Board cannot recognize the presence of exceptional circumstances in this. With this reasoning, all aspects of the contested decision would automatically and at any time become the subject of the appeal proceedings, regardless of whether these aspects are addressed in the statement of grounds for appeal. This would significantly undermine the provisions of Article 108 and Rule 99(2) EPC, including Articles 12 and 13 RPBA. The Board therefore does not admit the argument based solely on the disclosure of document D2 regarding a lack of inventive step into the appeal proceedings (Article 13(2) RPBA).

9. In summary, it should be noted that the newly submitted documents D13 and D14 by the appellant are not admitted into the appeal proceedings because they only address aspects that have already been extensively discussed in the opposition proceedings and should therefore have been submitted there, Article 12(6) RPBA. Since the objections raised in the statement of grounds for appeal are all based on D13 or D14, they cannot lead to the overturning of the opposition division's decision. An objection directed solely at D2 was first raised in the appeal proceedings during the oral proceedings before the Board; the arguments related to it cannot be considered under Article 13(2) RPBA in the absence of exceptional circumstances.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided: The appeal is dismissed.",opposition rejected,opposition rejected,appeal dismissed,Huntsman International LLC,Huntsman International LLC 10003 Woodloch Forest Drive The Woodlands TX 77380 / US,"Lee, Alexander Mark, et al, et al Huntsman (Europe) BV Grijpenlaan 18 3300 Tienen / BE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. European Patent No. 2 819 640 was granted with 14 claims. Claim 1 of the patent reads as follows:

""1. Cosmetic formulation comprising

Glycerin and solid particles with an average particle size of 3 μm to 15 μm, particularly preferably from 4 μm to 10 μm,

characterized in that

the particles contain at least 95 wt.%, preferably at least 97 wt.%, particularly preferably at least 99 wt.% native cellulose derived from plant fibers, with the weight percentages referring to the total dry weight of the particles, and

that it is an emulsion.""

II. An opposition was filed against the grant of the patent. The grounds for opposition included lack of novelty and lack of inventive step (Article 100 a) EPC), insufficient disclosure (Article 100 b) EPC), and impermissible extension of content (Article 100 c) EPC).

III. The Opposition Division decided to revoke the patent. This decision was based on the granted patent as the main request.

IV. The following documents were cited inter alia in the decision of the Opposition Division:

D1: US 2005/0002996 A1

D3: US 2007/0062009 A1

D7: US 3530 217 A

D11: EP 1 057 477 A1

D14: Information sheet ""Cellulobeads""

D19: Manufacturer's website on Cellulon CP Kelco

V. In particular, the Opposition Division stated in its decision that the granted patent met the requirements of Articles 123(2), 83, and 54 EPC, but not those of Article 56 EPC.

VI. The patent holder (appellant) filed an appeal against the above decision.

VII. The following relevant evidence for the decision was submitted by the parties during the appeal proceedings:

D29: Test results

VIII. An oral hearing took place before the Board on September 19, 2023.

IX. The appellant (patent holder) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent in the granted version (main request). Furthermore, it requested that the documents D26 to D28 submitted with the response to the appeal not be admitted into the appeal proceedings. It also requested the admission of document D29.

X. The respondent (opponent) requested the dismissal of the appeal. Furthermore, it requested that neither the submission of June 29, 2023, nor the document D29 submitted with this submission be admitted into the proceedings.

XI. The relevant arguments of the appellant for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) The submission of June 29, 2023, should be admitted into the proceedings as it was submitted in direct response to the preliminary opinion of the Board.

b) The subject matter of the granted patent differs from the subject matter of the closest prior art D11 by the type of cellulose particles. The comparative test submitted as D25 proves that the use of the claimed cellulose derived from plant fibers achieves improved sensory properties when applied to the skin. The technical problem to be solved therefore consists in providing mechanically stable cosmetic formulations with good skin sensory properties. The use of the claimed cellulose is in no way suggested by the combination of D11 with the teachings of any other prior art. Consequently, the subject matter of the granted patent is inventive.

XII. The relevant arguments of the respondent for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

a) The submission of June 29, 2023, should not be admitted into the proceedings. The submission constitutes a change in the appellant's presentation, for which no reasons were given for its submission in the appeal proceedings. The submission does not meet the requirements of Article 12(4) RPBA. In particular, the obviousness of an error and its correction has not been convincingly demonstrated.

b) The subject matter of the granted patent differs from the subject matter of the closest prior art D11 by the type of cellulose particles. A technical effect was not demonstrated by appropriate comparative tests, particularly not across the entire breadth of claim 1. The technical problem to be solved therefore consists in providing an alternative, stable glycerin-containing cosmetic emulsion that has good sensory properties, including providing acceptable moisture on the skin without being sticky or leaving a slippery residue. The use of the claimed cellulose for cosmetic applications, including in emulsions, is suggested in D1, D3, D7, D14, and D19. Consequently, the subject matter of the granted patent does not involve any inventive step.","Reasons for the Decision

1. Admission of New Evidence and Arguments

1.1 Since the present reasoning of the decision does not refer to documents D26 to D28 as well as D29, and the submission of June 29, 2023, insofar as it relates to D29, the question of the admission of these documents and the corresponding submissions is not relevant for the present decision.

1.2 The remaining submission of June 29, 2023, refers to the weight percentages indicated in D25 and the evaluation of the comparative test in D25 (see submission of June 29, 2023, page 1, last paragraph, and page 2, first and second paragraphs). As mentioned by the appellant in their submission of June 29, 2023, this submission is a direct and appropriate response to the questions raised in the preliminary opinion (see points 3.2.5 to 3.2.7 a) of the preliminary opinion). The raising of partly new questions in the preliminary opinion of the Board of Appeal (in particular point 3.2.7 of the preliminary opinion) constitutes exceptional circumstances within the meaning of Article 13 (2) RPBA. Furthermore, the submission does not contain any arguments that can be considered complex.

The arguments of the respondent in this regard are more related to whether the appellant's submissions are convincing or not, rather than the question of admission. The actual obviousness of the alleged error and its correction, as well as the repeated errors in the appellant's submissions in the first instance proceedings, are not relevant to the question of the admission of the appellant's submission according to Article 13 (1) and 13 (2) RPBA 2020.

Thus, the remaining submission of June 29, 2023 (see submission of June 29, 2023, page 1 last paragraph and page 2 first and second paragraphs) is admitted into the proceedings (Article 13 (1) and 13 (2) RPBA 2020).

2. Amendments, Sufficient Disclosure, and Novelty

2.1 The respondent did not pursue their objections under Article 100 (a) EPC in connection with Article 54 EPC, as well as under Article 100 (b) EPC and Article 100 (c) EPC in the appeal proceedings.

2.2 The Board is of the opinion that these grounds for opposition do not preclude the maintenance of the granted patent.

3. Inventive Step

3.1 Closest Prior Art

3.1.1 The patent relates to a cosmetic emulsion that contains glycerin and solid particles with a specific particle size. These solid particles contain at least 95 wt.% cellulose derived from plant fibers. This emulsion is intended to be stable and to exhibit improved sensory properties when applied to the skin (see paragraphs [0003], [0004], [0006] to [0008] of the patent).

3.1.2 Both parties considered D11, Example 2, as the closest prior art. The Board sees no reason to deviate from this.

3.1.3 D11 relates to emulsions that contain fibrillar cellulose as stabilizing agents instead of emulsifiers. The description of the fibrillar cellulose particles used (see paragraphs [0014] to [0021]) generally includes the particles claimed in the contested patent. Example 2 describes a stable cosmetic emulsion that contains 5 wt.% glycerin, 10 wt.% apricot kernel oil, and as particles 1.7 wt.% cellulose microfibrils and 0.3 wt.% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC).

3.2 Difference and Effect

3.2.1 It was undisputed that the patented formulation differs from the formulation of Example 2 of D11 by the type of cellulose particles. Instead of the microfibrillar cellulose particles (5-40 μm in length and 0.002-1 μm in diameter) mixed with CMC from D11, the claimed formulation contains solid particles with an average size of 3-15 μm containing at least 95 wt.% native cellulose derived from plant fibers.

3.2.2 The parties disagreed regarding the resulting effect. According to the appellant, the patented formulations would show improved sensory properties when applied to the skin. This improved property is evidenced by the comparative test submitted as D25.

Consideration of the Comparative Test

3.2.3 The said comparative test (submitted as D25 with the statement of appeal) was first submitted in the opposition proceedings in February 2021, i.e., after the priority date of the patent. In the written proceedings, the respondent mentioned the consideration of the subsequently published comparative test in connection with decision G 2/21.

3.2.4 The Board notes that achieving improved sensory properties was already disclosed as an objective in the original application (see pages 2 to 3). Furthermore, various sensory properties - including absorption, stickiness, and oiliness - of the claimed formulations were evaluated in comparison to formulations without cellulose or with MCC in the original examples (see Examples 1 to 4 of the original application). The effect reported in the subsequently published comparative test is thus clearly encompassed by the technical teaching disclosed in the original application.

In light of decision G 2/21, the Board therefore believes that the subsequently published test (see D25) should be taken into account.

Significance of the Comparative Test

3.2.5 The respondent argued that the comparative tests submitted in the first instance proceedings (see comparative tests in the appellant's letters of February 25, 2021, and February 26, 2021, and summary in D25) are not significant.

Comparative formulation 1 is not an accurate representation of the formulation disclosed in Example 2 of D11 because (i) the type of cellulose particles and (ii) the amount of water differ.

This difference between the formulation of Example 2 of D11 and the comparative formulation (FU01/21-1) of D25 would be reflected in the respective different results reported in D11 and D25.

3.2.6 Regarding the type of cellulose particles used, the Board notes that the designation of the particles in Example 2 of D11 is not clear.

On one hand, ""cellulose microfibrils"" are mentioned. The respondent seemed to consider these as microfibrillar cellulose mechanically produced from plant cellulose fibers. On the other hand, the cellulose microfibrils in Example 2 of D11 are referred to as ""Cellulon PC from Kelco"" (emphasis added). Based on this designation, the appellant argued that the particles used are likely to be the commercial product Cellulon™ from CP Kelco (formerly a product of Weyerhaeuser, see D24). This product consists of bacterial, fermentatively produced cellulose (see D19, D21 page 29 caption, D22 e.g. Introduction, and D23 page 160, left column).

The Board notes that there is no indication in D11 that the cellulose particles used (including the particles from Example 2) could not be bacterial particles (see in particular paragraph [0016]). In paragraph [0019] of D11, only the product ""Cellulon from Kelco"" (instead of ""Cellulon PC"") is referenced in connection with ""cellulose fibrils"" (and not ""microfibrils""). Furthermore, there is no evidence that Kelco produced or has produced any cellulose other than the bacterial cellulose Cellulon™. The respondent also did not provide evidence that ""Cellulon PC"" is actually a different product and how it could be obtained. Additionally, according to D21 to D23, bacterial cellulose appears to have a fibrillar structure and only exhibits the same properties as microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) without having a true microcrystalline structure.

After weighing the probabilities, the Board is therefore of the opinion that the product used in the comparative test ""Cellulon CP Kelco"" corresponds to the cellulose particles described in Example 2 of D11.

3.2.7 Regarding the different amounts of water, 73.7 wt.% water was used in the formulations of the comparative test (FU01/21-1 and FU01/21-2), while 76.7 wt.% water was used in the formulation of Example 2 of D11. Furthermore, the specified amounts of the various components of both formulations of the comparative test only add up to 97 wt.% due to these different amounts of water instead of 100 wt.%. The appellant stated in this regard that the amounts of water represent an obvious error. The amounts of water used would correspond to the required amounts to reach a total of 100 wt.%.

The Board notes that the reference in D25 to ""the formulation of Example 2 of D11 FU01/21-1"" (emphasis added) establishes a direct identity link between the formulation FU01/21-1 in D25 and the formulation from Example 2 of D11. The Board therefore believes that the skilled person would indeed consider the water specification in D25 as an obvious error, the correction of which would also be obvious.

Regardless, the formulation according to the invention (FU01/21-2) in the comparative test contains the same amount of water as the comparative formulation (FU01/21-1), so both formulations differ solely by the distinguishing feature, i.e., the type of cellulose particles.

3.2.8 The respondent's argument regarding a different homogeneity of the formulations described in Example 2 of D11 and in the comparative test is not convincing. The comparative formulation of D25 is described as ""white, homogeneous,"" which actually corresponds to the homogeneity of the formulation from Example 2 of D11 as presented by the respondent. As explained by the appellant during the oral proceedings, phase separation of the comparative formulation only occurs upon application to the skin. This property was not evaluated in Example 2 of D11.

Furthermore, contrary to the respondent's opinion, the results obtained in Example 2 of D11 and in the comparative test (see D25) do not contradict each other. D11 merely states that the cream is well tolerated even on sensitive skin. The sensory properties when spreading the cream on the skin are not described. In contrast, the comparative test evaluates the slipperiness when spreading, the skin feel, and absorption. Even though D11 describes as a general objective the avoidance of known disadvantages, such as stickiness or residue (see paragraphs [0005] to [0007]), this does not mean that the specific cream produced in Example 2 necessarily fulfills these properties.

3.2.9 The Board is therefore of the opinion that the comparative example from D25 convincingly demonstrates an effect of the distinguishing feature, namely improved sensory properties, for the tested formulation.

3.2.10 In the written proceedings, the respondent also argued that the viscosity of both formulations in the comparative test (see D25) is similar. Consequently, the claimed cellulose particles would not exhibit any special effect.

This argument is not convincing. The fact that both emulsions have a similar viscosity does not prevent them from behaving differently when spread on the skin.

Demonstration of the Effect Across the Entire Scope of Claim 1

3.2.11 The respondent argued during the oral proceedings that the granted Claim 1 is broadly formulated. In particular, particles of different sizes as well as cellulose from a very wide variety of sources are claimed. Any woody plant would actually qualify as a source according to Claim 1. In contrast to this variety of claimed particles, only one type of particle was tested in D25, namely ""Ultrafine Cellulose Arbocel M8."" Therefore, a single example is not sufficient to credibly demonstrate the alleged effect across the entire scope of Claim 1.

3.2.12 During the oral proceedings, the appellant countered that bacterial, fermentatively produced celluloses like those from Example 2 of D11 exhibit a fibrillar ""growing in strands"" structure. The fibrils would then form MCC-like networks. In contrast, native celluloses derived from plant fibers would exhibit a cross-linked structure. Thus, the claimed celluloses have a uniform structure that distinguishes them from bacterial celluloses and MCC.

3.2.13 As presented by the appellant, it is therefore credible that the effect demonstrated in D25 occurs for the claimed particles independently of the type of plant from which the cellulose is derived, and thus across the entire scope of the granted Claim 1 compared to the bacterial, fermentatively produced cellulose from Example 2 of D11.

3.2.14 The counterarguments presented by the respondent based on the high number of different cellulose-containing plants are not sufficient to doubt this structural explanation. In this context, the question of the claimed particle size range is also not relevant, as it does not represent the distinguishing feature from the closest prior art, and the said uniform structure of the claimed celluloses does not seem to depend on particle size.

3.3 Objective Technical Problem

The objective technical problem starting from D11 is consequently to provide a further glycerin- and cellulose-containing cosmetic formulation with improved sensory properties when applied to the skin.

3.4 Obviousness of the Proposed Solution

None of the documents cited by the respondent D1, D3, D7, D14, or D19 suggests replacing the cellulose component from D11 with native cellulose derived from plant fibers to improve the sensory properties when applied to the skin. The respondent did not present any argument regarding a hint towards such an improvement in the prior art. The cited documents describe other objectives. D1 relates to the release of an active ingredient contained in cellulose fibers, D3 refers to products that are non-irritating to the respiratory tract, D7 discloses compositions that absorb excess sebum, and D14 and D19 are merely fact sheets for commercial cellulose particles that do not describe any of the present sensory properties.

3.5 Consequently, the subject matter of the granted claims meets the requirements of Article 56 EPC, and the ground for opposition under Article 100 (a) EPC in connection with Article 56 EPC does not preclude the maintenance of the granted patent.","Decision formula, For these reasons it is decided:, The contested decision is annulled., The patent is maintained in its unchanged form.",opposition rejected,opposition rejected,decision under appeal is set aside,"Mayr Kotsch Patentanwalt Rechtsanwältin, Partnerschaftsgesellschaft mbB",Mayr Kotsch Patentanwalt Rechtsanwältin Partnerschaftsgesellschaft mbB Design Offices Luise-Ullrich-Str. 14 80636 München / DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The applicant (patent owner) has filed an appeal against the decision of the opposition division to maintain European patent No. 1 464 322 as amended in the form of auxiliary request 5 filed on October 20, 2015.

II. An opposition was filed by respondents I and II (respectively opponents (1) and (2)) seeking the revocation of the patent in its entirety for lack of novelty and inventive step (Article 100(a) EPC), for insufficient disclosure of the invention (Article 100(b) EPC), and for extension of the subject matter of the patent as granted beyond the content of the application as filed. Among others, the following documents were cited in the opposition proceedings:

(1) EP-B-1 432 390,

(3) EP-A-1 133 977,

(5) EP-A-1 166 753, and

(11) EP-A-1 219 285.

III. According to the opposition division, claim 1 of the patent as granted extended the subject matter of the patent beyond the content of the application as filed and was therefore not compliant with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

The subject matter of claims 1 of auxiliary requests 1 to 3 lacked novelty over documents (1), (3), (5), and/or (11).

The subject matter of claim 19 of auxiliary request 4 did not involve an inventive step. The composition of example 2 of document (3) represented the closest prior art to the invention. This composition included a fluorescent dye in the orange range (Basic Yellow 2) with an amphoteric surfactant (diethylene glycol monoethyl ether) and did not include any oxidation dyes or oxidizing agents. The subject matter of claim 19 therefore differed from the composition of example 2 of document (3) solely by the use of fluorescent dyes (F1) or (F3) instead of the dye Basic Yellow 2. In the absence of a technical effect, the technical problem had to be formulated as providing an alternative lightening composition. The replacement of the dye Basic Yellow 2 with the known dyes (F1) or (F3) was an obvious alternative not involving an inventive step.

The use for coloring keratin fibers with a lightening effect according to claim 1 of auxiliary request 5 differed from the disclosure of document (3) in that the hair compositions used did not include an oxidizing agent or oxidation dye. The technical effect was the achievement of lighter hair. The technical problem could therefore be formulated as providing a means to achieve a lightening effect on pigmented or artificially colored keratin fibers in the absence of oxidation dyes and oxidizing agents. A person skilled in the art would not have removed the oxidation dyes and oxidizing agents from the composition since the presence of oxidizing agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, is essential when one wishes to lighten keratin fibers (see document (11), examples 1 and 2, pages 8 and 9).

The opposition division thus considered that the patent could be maintained in the form of auxiliary request 5.

IV. The applicant contested the opposition division's conclusions regarding the lack of novelty or inventive step of the subject matter of the claims of auxiliary requests 1 to 4 considered in the decision. He filed with his appeal brief a main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 7.

Claim 1 of the main request corresponds to claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 before the opposition division and reads as follows:

""1. Use of a composition comprising in a cosmetically acceptable medium, at least one fluorescent dye in the orange range soluble in the medium chosen from the fluorescent dyes belonging to the following families: naphthalimides; cationic or non-cationic coumarins; xanthene dioxazines; azaxanthenes; naphtholactams, azlactones; oxazines; thiazines; dioxazines; monocationic or polycationic fluorescent dyes of azoic, azomethinic, or methinic type and at least one amphoteric surfactant chosen from betaines and imidazolium derivatives and/or at least one non-ionic surfactant chosen from alkylpyrrolidones, oxyalkylene or glycerol ethers of fatty alcohols, oxyalkylene or glycerol esters of fatty acids of monoalcohols, esters of fatty acids and polyols possibly oxyalkylene or glycerol, for coloring with a lightening effect dark human skin or pigmented or artificially colored human keratin fibers.""

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 differs from claim 1 of the main request in that the keratin fibers have a tone height of 6 or lower.

Auxiliary request 2 corresponds to auxiliary request 2 then pending before the opposition division. Claim 1 of this request differs from claim 1 of the main request in that the surfactant is not chosen from the oxyalkylene esters of fatty acids and polyols.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 differs from claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 in that the keratin fibers have a tone height of 6 or lower.

Auxiliary request 4 corresponds to auxiliary request 3 then pending before the opposition division. Claim 1 of auxiliary request 4 differs from claim 1 of the main request in that the surfactant is not chosen from the oxyalkylene or glycerol esters of fatty acids and polyols.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 5 differs from claim 1 of auxiliary request 4 in that the keratin fibers have a tone height of 6 or lower.

Auxiliary request 6 corresponds to auxiliary request 4 then pending before the opposition division. Claims 1 to 19 and 31 of this request correspond to claims 1 to 20 of auxiliary request 5 maintained by the opposition division in the contested decision.

Claim 20 of auxiliary request 6 reads as follows:

""20. Composition characterized in that it comprises, in a cosmetically acceptable medium, at least one fluorescent dye soluble in the medium chosen from the group formed by dyes of the following structures:

V. According to the applicant, the use, subject of claim 1 of the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 5, was restricted to colorations with a lightening effect on specific keratin fibers, namely pigmented or artificially colored human keratin fibers. Document (3) did not specify the nature of the hair to be treated and included colorations on white hair. Furthermore, document (3) did not disclose the lightening of keratin fibers. The subject matter of claim 1 of the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 5 was therefore novel over document (3). It was also novel over documents (1), (5), and (11) due to the absence of an oxidizing agent.

The invention aimed to solve the problem of lightening dark pigmented or artificially colored keratin fibers without altering the integrity of said fibers, that is to say, without presenting the disadvantages of hydrogen peroxide. No document of the prior art aimed to solve the technical problem of the invention.

This technical problem was solved by the use of a composition comprising fluorescent dyes in the orange range, as claimed in claim 1 of the main request. Examples 1 and 2 of the patent showed that treating dark hair with compositions comprising fluorescent dyes provided a visible lightening effect. The presence in the composition of a surfactant such as sodium N-cocoylamido-N-ethoxycarboxymethylglycinate further exacerbated this fluorescence phenomenon on keratin fibers. Compositions (A) and (E) comprising only fluorescent dyes provided a significantly lower effect than when the fluorescent dye was associated with a surfactant according to the invention. The results of the tests submitted with the appeal brief demonstrated that the pigmented keratin fibers treated with the compositions containing a fluorescent dye and a surfactant required by claim 1 appeared lighter.

A person skilled in the art wishing to lighten dark hair without degrading it would not find in the cited documents the teaching to use fluorescent dyes in the orange range. On the contrary, according to the general knowledge of the person skilled in the art, it was not possible to lighten keratin fibers using direct dyes without using a chemical oxidizing agent. Indeed, direct dyes were known to color hair without allowing for the lightening of hair. A direct dye that fluoresced in the orange range had, on the contrary, the ability to lighten keratin fibers by an optical effect and this, without the use of an oxidizing agent, which allowed for the integrity of the colored fibers to be maintained. The subject matter of the claims of the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 5 therefore involved an inventive step in view of the cited prior art and the general knowledge of the person skilled in the art.

Regarding auxiliary request 6 (incorrectly referred to as auxiliary request 5 in the appeal brief), contrary to the conclusions of the opposition division, the composition of example 2 of document (3) was devoid of surfactant in the sense of the invention, since diethylene glycol monoethyl ether was not a surfactant, but a solvent. Furthermore, document (3) did not mention the use of this composition on pigmented or artificially colored fibers for the purpose of lightening them.

The comparative tests already submitted in the first instance and attached to the appeal brief dated September 27, 2016 (document (18)) demonstrated that the presence of particular surfactants in the composition allowed for a significant lightening of the hair. The person skilled in the art was not encouraged to add a surfactant compliant with claim 20 of auxiliary request 6 in order to improve the lightening. The subject matter of claims 20 to 35 of auxiliary request 6 therefore involved an inventive step.

VI. Respondent I requested that auxiliary requests 1, 3, 5, and 7 not be admitted into the appeal proceedings because they were filed late without reasons explaining why they had not been filed earlier before the opposition division.

According to respondent I, the subject matter of claim 1 of the patent as granted extended beyond the content of the application as filed.

The invention as claimed in claim 3 required a lightening of at least half a tone, which was not sufficiently described to be executed by a person skilled in the art.

The subject matter of claim 1 of the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 5 lacked novelty and/or inventive step over documents (1), (3), (5), and/or (11).

Document (3) disclosed compositions for lightening hair dyeing and could represent the closest prior art to the invention. The claimed compositions differed from the compositions of examples 7, 8, 11, and 13 of this document only by the nature of the direct dye. No technical effect resulted from this distinguishing feature. The objective problem underlying the invention could therefore only be seen in the use of an alternative lightening dye composition. The direct dye Basic Red 12 was known from document (11). The person skilled in the art would have considered replacing the dye present in the compositions of examples 7, 8, 11, and 13 of document (3) with the dye Basic Red 12 and would thus have arrived at the subject matter of the claims of auxiliary requests 1 to 5 without demonstrating inventive step.

The subject matter of these claims also lacked inventive step starting from document (5) in combination with document (7).

VII. Respondent II requested that auxiliary requests 1, 3, 5, and 7 not be admitted into the appeal proceedings because they were not substantiated (Article 12(2) and (4) RPCR).

According to respondent II, claim 1 of the main request and auxiliary requests 1, 2, 4, and 6 did not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

The invention as claimed in claims 1 to 26 of the main request was not sufficiently disclosed in the patent to be executed by a person skilled in the art.

The subject matter of claim 1 of the main request lacked novelty and/or inventive step over documents (1), (3), (5), and (11).

Regarding auxiliary request 6, the applicant had not demonstrated that the compositions of claims 20 to 35 of auxiliary request 6 had the effect of lightening human keratin fibers, or that the dyes mentioned in these claims had an advantage over those used in documents (3), (5), and (11). No technical effect was therefore associated with the use of dyes of formula F1 or F3 instead of the dye Basic Yellow 2 disclosed in document (3). Consequently, the claimed compositions represented only obvious alternatives to the compositions described in the prior art documents. In particular, the use of a fluorescent dye of formula F1 or F3 was obvious since these dyes were commercially available, as indicated in paragraph [0038] of the patent. The subject matter of claims 20 to 35 of auxiliary request 6 was also devoid of inventive step.

VIII. The applicant filed auxiliary requests 8 to 10 with a letter dated July 31, 2017, auxiliary request 8 corresponding to the request as maintained by the opposition division.

IX. In a notification dated August 7, 2019, accompanying the summons to an oral proceeding scheduled for May 5, 2020, the Board indicated that the subject matter of the claims of the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 5 included oxidation dyeing processes of hair in the presence of oxidation dyes and an oxidizing agent, hydrogen peroxide being particularly preferred. Therefore, the applicant's argument that an alternative to hydrogen peroxide was sought to lighten dark hair had to be rejected. The Board also noted that respondent I had not made any observations regarding auxiliary request 6.

X. In response to the summons, respondents I and II announced in letters dated October 2, 2019, and August 28, 2019, respectively, that they would not attend the oral proceedings.

The applicant announced in a letter dated March 17, 2020, that he would not attend the oral proceedings scheduled for May 5, 2020, and requested that the decision be made based on the requests and arguments present in the file. He did not provide any comments regarding the Board's remarks.

XI. On April 23, 2020, the Board canceled the oral proceedings scheduled for May 5, 2020.

XII. The applicant (patent owner) requested in writing the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent on the basis of the main request, submitted as auxiliary request 1 with a letter dated September 17, 2015, or alternatively on the basis of auxiliary requests 1 to 10, with auxiliary requests 1 to 7 being attached to the appeal brief dated September 27, 2016, and auxiliary requests 8 to 10 being filed with a letter dated July 31, 2017.

Respondents I and II (opponents (1) and (2)) requested in writing the rejection of the appeal.","Reasons for the decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

Main request

2. Inventive activity: claim 1

Document (3) relates to hair dye compositions. Permanent hair dyes consist of a first part containing an alkaline agent, an oxidation dye, and a direct dye, and a second part containing an oxidizing agent. Semi-permanent hair dyes, on the other hand, consist of a single part containing an organic acid or an alkaline agent, and a direct dye (paragraphs [0001] and [0002]).

The composition disclosed in example 7 of document (3) is a two-part composition. The first part of the composition includes, in particular, the direct dye Basic Yellow 2, which is a dye required by claim 1 of the main request, and the polyethoxylated ether (20) of isostearyl alcohol, which is a non-ionic surfactant of the oxyalkylene fatty alcohol ether type required by claim 1. The second part of the composition includes hydrogen peroxide, which is an oxidizing agent. These two parts are mixed just before being applied to the hair, allowing for simultaneous coloring and lightening of the hair (see paragraphs [0017] and [0025]).

According to the applicant, the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request was novel compared to this disclosure, as the use of claim 1 of the main request aims to color human keratin fibers that are pigmented or artificially colored with a lightening effect, whereas document (3) does not specify the nature of the hair to be treated, thus including white hair.

Even assuming, in favor of the applicant, that the choice of the nature of the hair to be treated is a distinguishing feature establishing novelty, the subject matter of claim 1 lacks inventive activity. Indeed, it is obvious to use a lightening dye composition on pigmented or artificially colored hair, and not on white hair which cannot be lightened.

According to the applicant, the technical problem was to find an alternative means to hydrogen peroxide for lightening dark hair. However, this argument is not relevant because the subject matter of claim 1 includes oxidation dyeing processes for hair in the presence of oxidation dyes and an oxidizing agent, with hydrogen peroxide being particularly preferred (see paragraphs [0098] and [0107] of the contested patent, page 14, lines 47; see also claims 24 and 48), claim 1 being characterized solely by the choice of the hair to be treated in favor of the applicant.

Therefore, the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request lacks inventive activity.

Auxiliary requests 1, 3, and 5

3. These requests were filed with the notice of appeal and, compared to the respective immediately lower-ranking requests, restrict the keratin fibers to be treated to those with a tone height of 6 or less.

According to Article 12(2), second sentence RPCR 2007, the notice setting out the grounds for the appeal must present the reasons for which it is requested to annul, modify, or confirm the contested decision, and must expressly and precisely set out all the facts, arguments, and justifications that are invoked.

The applicant did not indicate in the notice of appeal how this limitation should contribute to the presence of inventive activity.

Consequently, these unfounded requests are dismissed from the appeal proceedings in accordance with Article 12(4) RPCR 2007.

Auxiliary requests 2 and 4

4. In claim 1 of these auxiliary requests, the surfactant has been restricted in order to establish novelty over document (1).

However, the surfactant required by claim 1 of these requests still includes the polyethoxylated ether (20) of isostearyl alcohol present in the composition of example 7 of document (3), which is a non-ionic surfactant of the oxyalkylene fatty alcohol ether type.

The conclusions regarding the lack of inventive activity concerning the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request also apply to auxiliary requests 2 and 4.

Auxiliary request 6

Claims 1 to 19 and 36

5. Claims 1 to 19 and 36 of auxiliary request 6 are identical to claims 1 to 20 of auxiliary request 5 maintained by the opposition division in the contested decision. The patent owner being the sole appellant against the interim decision of the opposition division maintaining the patent in its modified form, neither the Board of Appeal nor the non-appellant opponents can contest the text of the patent as approved in the interim decision according to the principle of prohibition of reformatio in peius, see decision G 9/12, OJ EPO, 1994, 875).

Claims 20 to 35

6. The opposition division considered that claim 20 met the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC and that its subject matter was novel compared to the cited documents. These conclusions having not been contested by the respondents, the only point in dispute concerns inventive activity.

7. Inventive activity

7.1 Closest prior art

The opposition division considered that the composition of example 2 of document (3) represented the closest prior art to the invention. This conclusion has not been contested by the parties.

The composition of example 2 of document (3) is a direct dye composition that includes the direct dye Basic Yellow 2 and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether. This composition therefore does not include the direct dye of formula F1 or F3 required by claim 20. The diethylene glycol monoethyl ether present in the composition of example 2 of document (3) is not an amphoteric surfactant as asserted by the opposition division. Furthermore, it does not represent a non-ionic surfactant chosen from alkylpyrrolidones, oxyalkylene or glycerol ethers, oxyalkylene or glycerol fatty alcohol monoester fatty acid esters, and fatty acid and polyol esters as required by the composition of claim 20 of auxiliary request 6.

Document (3) discloses the preparation of dye compositions, but no example of use for dyeing hair. A lightening effect on dark hair is therefore not disclosed in document (3) regarding the composition of example 2, which is a direct dye composition that does not include oxidizing agents.

In conclusion, the composition of example 2 of document (3) does not include any of the components required by the composition of claim 20 of auxiliary request 6 and does not disclose a lightening effect when dyeing dark hair.

7.2 Technical problem

The opposition division defined the problem as providing an alternative lightening dye composition.

However, since document (3) does not disclose a lightening effect for the composition of example 2, the problem must be formulated as providing a dye composition having a lightening effect on dark hair without degrading the fiber.

7.3 Solution

The proposed solution is the direct dye composition according to claim 20, characterized by the association of a surfactant chosen from betaines and imidazolium derivatives and/or at least one non-ionic surfactant chosen from alkylpyrrolidones, oxyalkylene or glycerol fatty alcohol ethers, fatty acid monoester oxyalkylene or glycerol esters, and fatty acid and polyol esters, and a direct dye of formula F1 or F3.

7.4 Success

The applicant relies on the results of the tests submitted on April 10, 2009 (document 18) to demonstrate that the compositions of claim 20 are solutions to this problem.

In the first series of tests, it is shown that the use of the direct dye of formula F3 (see composition A), according to the invention, allows for a visually observable optical lightening of the treated strands compared to the untreated hair strand. It is also shown that the lightening effect is amplified by the presence of a surfactant as required by claim 20, namely by an amphoteric surfactant or a polyethoxylated fatty alcohol ether (steareth-20) - see compositions B, C, and D.

The second series of tests confirms this lightening effect with results on reflectance for other combinations of dyes of formula F3 and surfactants required by the compositions of claim 20.

According to respondent II, document (18) only showed an increase in reflectance for wavelengths above 570 nm, while for wavelengths below, untreated hair reflected more light than hair treated with the compositions according to the invention, so that, overall, there was no lightening of the colored hair across the entire visible spectrum.

However, the respondent's analysis of the absorption properties of the compositions according to the invention from the tests of document (18) corresponds to what is sought by the invention. Indeed, dye compositions must be compositions having a yellow-orange direct dye, thus including a dye that absorbs light in the visible range at wavelengths below 570 nm. Furthermore, instead of being dissipated as heat, the energy absorbed at these wavelengths is returned as light at wavelengths corresponding to yellow-orange (fluorescence phenomenon), which provides the lightening effect for the desired color.

The Board is therefore satisfied that document (18) shows that the compositions according to claim 20, free of oxidizing agents, provide a coloring with a lightening effect on dark hair without degrading them.

7.5 Evidence of the solution

According to the opposition division, it was obvious to replace the Basic Yellow 2 dye present in composition 2 of document (3) with another fluorescent dye, for example, the commercial dye F1, as indicated in paragraph 38 of the contested patent, to obtain an alternative lightening dye composition.

However, document (3) does not disclose that the composition of example 2 provides a lightening effect on dark hair. Moreover, the information that dye F1 is a fluorescent dye comes solely from the contested patent. Finally, even by replacing Basic Yellow 2 with dye F1 in the composition of example 2 of document (3), the skilled person does not arrive at the subject matter of claim 20 due to the absence of the required surfactant for the compositions according to the invention. It should be noted that the presence of this surfactant allows for amplifying the lightening effect (see document (18); point 7.4 above). The subject matter of claim 20 does not therefore arise in an obvious manner from the state of the art.

7.6 Consequently, the Board concludes that the subject matter of claim 20 of auxiliary request 6, and for the same reasons that of dependent claims 21 to 35, involves inventive activity.

8. The Board granting auxiliary request 6, there is no need to rule on auxiliary requests 7 to 10.","Device, For these reasons, it is decided as follows: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2. The case is referred back to the opposition division with the order to maintain the patent on the basis of claims 1 to 36 of auxiliary request 6 filed with the statement of grounds of appeal dated September 27, 2016, and a description to be adapted accordingly.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,decision under appeal is set aside,"Henkel AG & Co.

I. European Patent No. 2 050 445 was granted based on 14 claims.

II. Two oppositions were filed on the grounds of Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty and inventive step, Article 100(b) EPC for insufficient disclosure of the invention, and Article 100(c) EPC for extension of the subject matter beyond the content of the earlier application as filed.

The opponent DOC Generici S.r.l. withdrew its opposition during the opposition proceedings. It is therefore not a party to this appeal procedure.

IV. The present appeals of the patent holder (appellant I) and the opponent (appellant II) are directed against the decision of the opposition division that the patent in modified form and the invention to which it relates meet the requirements set out in the EPC.

The decision was based on two sets of claims: the main request filed by letter dated October 16, 2015, and auxiliary request 1 submitted during the oral proceedings on December 18, 2015.

In the decision, the opposition division found that the subject matter of claims 3 and 6 to 8 of the main request did not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. In contrast, the claims of auxiliary request 1 satisfied the conditions of this article, the invention was sufficiently disclosed, and the subject matter was novel and inventive.

V. In its statement of grounds of appeal, appellant I submitted sixteen sets of claims referred to as ""main request"" and ""auxiliary requests"" A, 1, 1A, 2, 2A, 3, 3A, 4, 4A, 5, 5A, 6, 6A, 7, and 7A. However, auxiliary requests 1, 1A, 2, 2A, 3, 3A, 4, 4A, 5, 5A, 6, 6A, 7, and 7A were withdrawn during the appeal proceedings (see letter dated December 30, 2019, last paragraph, and minutes of the oral proceedings of November 16, 2020, page 3, paragraph 7).

The main request and auxiliary request A correspond respectively to the main request and auxiliary request 1 on which the contested decision is based.

The wording of claims 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9 of the main request is as follows:

""1. Fenofibrate composition having a dissolution of at least 10% in 5 minutes, 20% in 10 minutes, 50% in 20 minutes, and 75% in 30 minutes, as measured according to the rotating paddle method at 75 rpm according to the European Pharmacopoeia, in a dissolution medium consisting of 1200 ml of water supplemented with 2% by weight of polysorbate 80 or 1000 ml of water supplemented with 0.025 molar sodium lauryl sulfate.""

""2. Composition according to claim 1, wherein the dissolution medium consists of 1200 ml of water supplemented with 2% by weight of polysorbate 80.""

""4. Composition according to one of claims 1 to 3, in the form of a tablet.""

""5. Composition according to one of claims 1 to 3, in the form of granules in a capsule.""

""8. Composition according to one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the fenofibrate is micronized.""

""9. Composition according to one of claims 1 to 8, comprising a hydrophilic polymer.""

Claim 1 of request A is identical to that of the main request. Its claims 2 to 5 correspond respectively to claims 2, 4, 5, and 9 of the main request.

VI. In its statement of grounds of appeal, appellant II requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

VII. In its response to appellant II's statement of grounds of appeal, appellant I argued that appellant II's appeal was not sufficiently substantiated regarding the issues of novelty and inventive step.

VIII. For the purpose of preparing for the oral proceedings, the Board sent a notification with its preliminary opinion. It considered in particular that claim 9 of the main request did not meet the requirements of Article 76(1) EPC. However, it gave a positive opinion regarding the sufficiency of disclosure.

IX. With a letter dated December 30, 2019, appellant I submitted auxiliary requests B, 1B, 2B, and 3B. It also argued that appellant II had not raised any objection under Article 76(1) EPC against claims 9 to 11 of the main request. Auxiliary request B was withdrawn during the oral proceedings held before the Board on November 16, 2020.

Auxiliary request 1B contains three claims. Claim 1 is identical to that of the main request, except for the phrase ""or 1000 ml of water supplemented with 0.025 molar sodium lauryl sulfate,"" which has been removed. Claims 2 and 3 correspond to claims 4 and 5 of the main request.

X. In its letter of February 20, 2020, appellant II presented arguments regarding lack of novelty and inventive step.

XI. During the oral proceedings held before the Board on November 16, 2020, appellant I submitted a new set of claims referred to as ""auxiliary request B-bis."" This request contained four claims corresponding to claims 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the main request.

XII. The following arguments were put forward by appellant I:

The subject matter of claim 8 of the main request is disclosed in claims 12 and 14 and the passages on page 9, lines 11-15 and on page 10, lines 11-14 of the earlier application as filed.

The opposition division considered in its decision (paragraph 20) that the subject matter of claim 9 met the requirements of Article 76(1) EPC. This point of the decision was not contested by appellant II in its statement of grounds of appeal (point 3.1). In particular, the appellant did not explain why the decision would be erroneous on this point. Therefore, the objection that claim 9 of the main request does not meet the requirements of Article 76(1) EPC is not admissible.

The composition of claim 9 of the main request is based in the earlier application on claim 12 and the passages of the description on page 6, lines 33-36, on page 7, lines 3-4, and on page 8, line 22. The earlier application also describes methods for preparing these compositions in its claim 14 and on page 9, lines 11-14 and 19-26.

Auxiliary request B-bis is admissible. It was submitted in response to the conclusion drawn by the Board during the oral proceedings that claim 8 did not meet the requirements of Article 76(1) EPC. This decision surprised appellant I because the Board's preliminary opinion did not mention claim 8. Appellant I therefore believed that claim 8 was compliant with the provisions of this article. Request B-bis results from the removal of claims in the main request. It simplifies the discussion and allows for a quicker procedure.

Auxiliary request 1B complies with Article 83 EPC. The definition of the composition of claim 1 based on its dissolution rate is common for the skilled person. Its preparation has been described in the patent and does not pose any particular problems. The patent illustrates such a composition in its example 1. Appellant II, who bears the burden of proof, has neither raised serious doubts nor provided evidence regarding the impossibility of reproducing the invention.

The objections of appellant II regarding lack of novelty or inventive step are not admissible. In its statement of grounds of appeal, appellant II simply made a general reference to the arguments submitted during the opposition proceedings, without explaining the reasons why the decision was erroneous. Arguments explaining these reasons were provided for the first time more than three years after the statement of grounds of appeal. They were submitted too late and should therefore not be admitted.

XIII. The following arguments were put forward by appellant II:

Claim 8 of the main request does not meet the requirements of Article 76(1) EPC. The earlier application as filed discloses micronized fenofibrate in specific formulations defined by its structural characteristics. It has never been disclosed in a general way related to the functional dissolution characteristics described in claim 1 of the main request, of which claim 8 depends. Furthermore, claims 12 and 14 of the earlier application do not constitute a valid basis since they contain limitations that are absent in claim 8 of the main request.

The objection under Article 76(1) EPC against claim 9 of the main request is admissible. It was raised by appellant II in point 3.1 of its statement of grounds of appeal, which indicates that this objection concerns all dependent claims 3 to 11 because they contain structural limitations that have never been disclosed in combination with the functional definition of claim 1.

Claim 9 of the main request relates to a fenofibrate composition defined by the functional characteristics described in claim 12 of the earlier application. However, these functional characteristics have never been described in combination with the hydrophilic polymer disclosed in the description or in claim 14. The earlier application discloses fenofibrate compositions according to the invention defined by their functional characteristics or by their structural characteristics, but not by a combination of both.

Auxiliary request B-bis is not admissible because it was submitted too late. It should have been submitted in response to the Board's preliminary opinion and not during the oral proceedings.

Auxiliary request 1B does not meet the requirements set out by Article 83 EPC. The composition of claim 1 is defined by the result to be achieved. Such a definition is not acceptable because it is not proportional to the technical contribution made by the invention, which is limited to example 1 of the patent. The skilled person would not be able to carry out the invention across the full scope of the claim. Furthermore, regarding the test of claim 1, essential parameters such as the amount of fenofibrate in the composition are missing.

The objections of lack of novelty and inventive step raised in the statement of grounds of appeal are admissible since, in light of the arguments and means provided in the opposition proceedings, they immediately clarify the reasons why the decision of the opposition division is erroneous. The statement of grounds of appeal indicates that, as argued in the opposition proceedings, the Lipanthyl® 200M composition and document D7 anticipate the claimed subject matter. In this context, the statement also refers to documents D8, D4, D5, D6, and D18. Regarding lack of inventive step, the statement of grounds of appeal indicates that D7 is the closest prior art. A conventional problem-solution approach was not possible because claim 1 is a statement of the problem and not a solution to the technical problem. The arguments presented in the letter of February 20, 2020, elaborate on those in the statement of grounds of appeal and should therefore also be admitted.

XIV. Appellant I requested the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent in a modified form based on one of the following sets of claims:

- main request or auxiliary request A submitted with its statement of grounds of appeal dated November 4, 2016,

- auxiliary request B-Bis submitted during the oral proceedings,

- auxiliary requests 1B, 2B, and 3B submitted with its letter of December 30, 2019.

XV. Appellant II requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

XVI. The Board rendered its decision at the end of the oral proceedings.","Reasons for the decision

1. The appeals are admissible. They meet the requirements of Articles 106 to 108 and Rule 99(2) EPC.

2. Main request - Article 76(1) EPC

In the opposition briefs against the patent in question, the objection raised regarding the ground for opposition under Article 100(c) EPC was the addition of elements compared to the earlier application as filed No. 98900125.0 and published under the number WO 98/31361 (see the opposition brief of March 24, 2014, page 1, last paragraph and page 5, point 3; and the opposition brief of March 26, 2014, page 2, lines 3-4 and pages 6-8, point c).

In this regard, the contested decision (paragraphs 16-22) and the appeal briefs are also based on the content of the earlier application as published WO 98/31361. Therefore, the relevant legal basis concerning the ground for opposition under Article 100(c) EPC is Article 76(1) EPC. Even though, in the written proceedings, the appellants cited Article 123(2) EPC, they agreed during the oral proceedings before the Board that the correct basis was Article 76(1) EPC.

The appellants also agreed that the content of publication WO 98/31361 was equivalent to that of the earlier application 98900125.0 as filed and thus served to assess compliance with the provisions of Article 76(1) EPC. The Board has no reason to deviate from this position.

2.1 Claim 8

The subject matter of claim 8 is a fenofibrate composition exhibiting the dissolution properties described in claim 1 and characterized in that the fenofibrate is in micronized form.

According to appellant I, the basis for this claim in application WO 98/31361 is found on page 9, lines 11-15 and on page 10, lines 11-14, as well as in claims 12 and 14.

On the one hand, claim 12 of WO 98/31361 describes an immediate-release fenofibrate composition having the dissolution properties of claim 1 of the main request. These dissolution properties are also mentioned in the description of WO 98/31361 on page 3, lines 1-11 and on page 5, lines 13-21. However, neither claim 12 nor the cited passages specify that the fenofibrate is in micronized form.

On the other hand, claim 14 of WO 98/31361 and the passages on page 9, lines 11-15 and on page 10, lines 11-14 describe micronized fenofibrate compositions where the fenofibrate is either combined with a hydrophilic polymer and deposited on inert cores (page 9, lines 11-15) or deposited on a water-soluble inert support (page 10, lines 11-14 and claim 14). Claim 1 and other passages of the description also refer to micronized fenofibrate, notably on page 5, lines 1-7, on page 6, lines 1-4, on page 9, lines 11-15 and 23-26, on page 10, lines 26-30 and on page 11, lines 12-17. However, all these passages describe fenofibrate either in combination with a hydrophilic polymer and possibly deposited on an inert support, or deposited on a water-soluble inert support. However, these technical features inseparably linked to the micronized form of fenofibrate are not present in claim 8 of the main request.

It follows that:

- the application WO 98/31361 describes fenofibrate compositions with the dissolution properties of claim 8, but in that context, it does not mention that the fenofibrate is in micronized form; and

- the technical features described in WO 98/31361 inseparably linked to the micronized form of fenofibrate are not present in claim 8.

Therefore, the Board concludes that claim 8 of the main request contains elements that go beyond the content of the earlier application as filed, which is contrary to the provisions of Article 76(1) EPC.

2.2 Claim 9

2.2.1 Admissibility

Appellant I contested the admissibility of the objection regarding the non-compliance of claim 9 of the main request with the provisions of Article 76(1) EPC. According to appellant I, point 3.1 of appellant II's appeal brief does not contest the opposition division's decision regarding claim 9. It does not further explain the reasons why this point of the decision would be erroneous.

The Board does not share this conclusion. Appellant II stated in the first paragraph of point 3.1 of its appeal brief:

""We fully concur with the Opposition Division's decision that the subject-matter of the Main Request does not meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.""

Then, in the second paragraph, it asserted:

""It is submitted that in particular claims 3 to 11 of the Main Request contravene Article 123(2) EPC, as the structural limitations of the dependent claims are never disclosed in conjunction with the purely functional definition of claim 1.""

The first paragraph leaves no doubt that, according to appellant II, the subject matter of the main request extends beyond the content of the earlier application. Subsequently, the second paragraph refers to the specific case of dependent claims 3 to 11. It explains that the reason why the subject matter of these claims extends beyond the content of the earlier application is that they contain structural limitations that have never been disclosed in combination with the purely functional definition of claim 1.

Even though the argument in paragraph 2 is very succinct, it is clear and understandable, especially in light of the argument also very succinctly presented by the opposition division in the contested decision (paragraph 20). Point 3.1 of the appeal brief contains the essence of the objection and allows for an immediate understanding of the reason why the reasoning in paragraph 20 of the contested decision is erroneous. The fact that the appeal brief cites Article 123(2) EPC instead of Article 76(1) EPC is irrelevant here (see point 2 above).

The objection regarding the addition of elements in claim 9 of the main request is therefore admissible.

2.2.2 Extension of the subject matter

Claim 9 of the main request relates to a fenofibrate composition exhibiting the dissolution properties described in claim 1 and characterized in that it comprises a hydrophilic polymer.

According to appellant I, the basis for this claim in application WO 98/31361 would be found in the combination of claim 12 with the passages on page 6, lines 33-36, on page 7, lines 3-4, and on page 8, line 22. Claim 14 and the passages on page 9, lines 11-14 and 19-26 would reinforce this view.

As explained above (point 2.1), claim 12 of WO 98/31361 describes an immediate-release fenofibrate composition having the dissolution properties of claim 1 of the main request. The definition of the composition in claim 12 is purely functional; it does not contain structural features beyond the presence of fenofibrate.

The question that arises in the context of examining compliance with the provisions of Article 76(1) EPC is therefore whether WO 98/31361 discloses a combination of the teaching of claim 12 with the structural element ""hydrophilic polymer.""

The passage in WO 98/31361 on page 6, lines 33-36, cited by appellant I, defines what a hydrophilic polymer is according to the invention. On page 7, lines 3-4, polyvinylpyrrolidone is disclosed as the preferred hydrophilic polymer. The passage on page 8, line 22 mentions a hydrophilic polymer in the context of a general structural definition of the composition according to the invention. The composition would contain, in addition to fenofibrate, at least one water-soluble inert support and a hydrophilic polymer in given concentration ranges.

Claim 14 and the passages on page 9, lines 11-14 and 19-26 describe methods for preparing a composition according to the invention. The composition resulting from the method according to claim 14 would contain micronized fenofibrate and a hydrophilic polymer deposited on a water-soluble inert support. Similarly, the compositions resulting from the methods on page 10, lines 11-14 and 19-26 would contain micronized fenofibrate and a hydrophilic polymer deposited on inert cores.

The Board notes that other passages in application WO 98/31361 also teach that the composition according to the invention contains, among other things, micronized fenofibrate and a hydrophilic polymer on an inert support (see page 5, lines 1-7 and 22-30; page 10, lines 1-3).

It follows that, as pointed out by appellant II, the composition of claim 9 of the main request results from extracting the technical feature ""hydrophilic polymer"" from its structural context to insert it into an exclusively functional context devoid of the associated structural features and described inseparably, such as the inert support or the fact that fenofibrate is in micronized form.

The composition of claim 9 of the main request is therefore contrary to the provisions of Article 76(1) EPC.

3. Auxiliary request A - extension of the subject matter

Claim 5 of auxiliary request A corresponds to claim 9 of the main request. Therefore, for the reasons outlined above, auxiliary request A is also contrary to Article 76(1) EPC.

4. Auxiliary request B-bis - admissibility

Auxiliary request B-bis is a set of four claims corresponding to claims 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the main request. It was submitted by appellant I during the oral proceedings before the Board in order to address the objection under Article 76(1) EPC regarding claim 8 of the main request. Appellant II contested its admissibility.

According to appellant I, since the Board had not mentioned claim 8 in its preliminary opinion accompanying the summons to the oral proceedings, he believed that claim 8 was compliant with the provisions of Article 76(1) EPC. He was therefore surprised by the Board's conclusion during the oral proceedings that claim 8 was not compliant with these provisions.

The Board is not convinced by this argument.

In the contested decision (paragraph 21), the opposition division concluded that the subject matter of claim 8 of the main request extended beyond the content of the earlier application.

In its notification of August 28, 2019 (point 7.2.1), the Board gave a negative opinion on this matter regarding claims 3 and 6 of the main request, of which claim 8 is dependent, and regarding claim 9. The Board then stated (point 7.2.2) that the objection also applied to all sets of auxiliary claims then on file, as they all contained equivalent claims. The Board therefore did not need to give its opinion on other claims since, for the reasons already outlined, none of the requests on file appeared to comply with Article 76(1) EPC.

Appellant I's interpretation that the non-mention of claim 8 in the Board's preliminary opinion was a positive opinion has no basis and cannot serve to justify a legitimate expectation. This is all the more true as the notification clearly indicated in its first paragraph that the Board's opinion was provisional, that it could not have any binding effect on the final decision, and that the notification did not contain an exhaustive list of issues to be addressed during the oral proceedings.

In fact, with his letter dated December 30, 2019, appellant I responded to the Board's preliminary opinion and submitted the sets of auxiliary claims B, 1B, 2B, and 3B, of which only auxiliary request B contained a claim equivalent to claim 8 of the main request. By doing so, appellant I anticipated and took into account the scenario in which claim 8 of the main request would not be deemed compliant with the conditions set out in the EPC.

The introduction at such a late stage of the proceedings of a request aimed at addressing an objection present in the contested decision is therefore not justified and goes against the principle of procedural economy. Consequently, following Article 13(1) RPCR 2020, the Board decided not to admit auxiliary request B-bis.

5. Auxiliary request 1B

Claims 1 to 3 of auxiliary request 1B correspond to claims 1, 4, and 5 of the main request.

Appellant II neither contested its admissibility nor raised an objection regarding the extension of its subject matter beyond the content of the earlier application. The Board also has no reason to do so.

5.1 Sufficiency of disclosure

According to appellant II, the fact that claim 1 is described in terms of the result to be achieved renders the disclosure of the invention insufficient. In particular, appellant II criticized the lack of structural technical features that would be essential to achieve the expected result as well as the breadth of claim 1 compared to the very specific teachings of the description. He also pointed out that essential parameters are missing in the test of claim 1. In this context, he referred to the amount of fenofibrate used in the dissolution test.

The Board is not convinced by these arguments. The patent contains sufficient information for a person skilled in the art to prepare the claimed composition without undue effort, and appellant II, who bears the burden of proof, has not demonstrated otherwise.

The composition of claim 1 relates to a fenofibrate composition having a particular dissolution profile, measured by the rotating paddle method at 75 rpm according to the European Pharmacopoeia in a specific dissolution medium.

The patent explains in paragraphs [0009], [0010], and [0015] to [0018] how to arrive at a composition having the claimed dissolution profile, notably by a preparation process in which a suspension comprising micronized fenofibrate with a particle size of less than 20 microns, at least 20% by weight of a hydrophilic polymer, and optionally a surfactant, is sprayed onto an inert support.

The hydrophilic polymer is preferably a polyvinylpyrrolidone with a molecular weight between 10,000 and 100,000 (paragraph [0027]). The inert support consists of particles of an excipient such as sugar or hydrolyzed starch (paragraph [0025]). The preferred surfactant is sodium lauryl sulfate (paragraph [0029]).

Example 1 illustrates one way to prepare the claimed composition while Example 2 demonstrates that the composition indeed achieves the expected result. In particular, Example 1 (paragraphs [0054] to [0061]) describes the preparation of a suspension of micronized fenofibrate with a particle size of about 5 microns, in an aqueous solution containing sodium lauryl sulfate (surfactant) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (hydrophilic polymer). This suspension is sprayed onto lactose crystals (water-soluble inert support) to obtain a granule that is transformed into tablets or capsules.

Regarding the description of the dissolution test, the fact that claim 1 does not specify the amount of fenofibrate to be used in the test does not raise serious doubts about the reproducibility of the invention, especially since the claim defines percentages of dissolved fenofibrate rather than absolute quantities. Even if the concentration of fenofibrate had some influence on the result of the test, appellant II has not proven that this influence would cause such significant variations that they would prevent the reproduction of the invention.

Finally, appellant II's assertion that the invention cannot be carried out without undue effort across the entire scope of claim 1 is purely speculative and is not supported by any evidence.

Therefore, the Board agrees with the patent holder that a lack of sufficiency of disclosure has not been demonstrated.

5.2 Admissibility of novelty and inventive step objections in appellant II's appeal brief

According to Article 12(2) RPCR 2007, the statement setting out the grounds of appeal must clearly and concisely present the reasons for requesting the annulment, modification, or confirmation of the contested decision and must expressly and precisely set out all facts, arguments, and justifications invoked. If these conditions are not met, the Board may consider the facts, evidence, and requests as inadmissible (Article 12(4) RPCR 2007, see also Article 25(1) RPCR 2020).

The case law of the Boards of Appeal establishes that, in principle, a statement that merely refers generally to arguments presented in the first instance is not sufficient within the meaning of Article 108, third sentence EPC (Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, V.A.2.6.4, point a, ninth edition, 2019).

In the present case, the Board agrees with appellant I (response of March 20, 2017, point 3) that the general reference in appellant II's appeal brief (points 5 and 6) to the novelty and inventive step arguments submitted during the opposition proceedings is not sufficient to substantiate the appeal with respect to Articles 54 and 56 EPC. Furthermore, the contested decision was favorable to appellant I, and appellant II did not explain on which point the decision would be erroneous.

In point 5.1 of its appeal brief, appellant II considered that, as advanced in the opposition proceedings, the formulation of the prior art Lipanthyl® 200M as well as the content of document D7 anticipated the claimed composition. He also referred to documents D8, D4, D5, D6, and D18. However,

during the opposition proceedings, appellant II contested the novelty of the claimed subject matter in its opposition brief with arguments that were supplemented during the oral proceedings with elements that were not originally mentioned, such as documents D18, D19c, and D19f and the modified figures 1. However, the minutes of the oral proceedings before the opposition division are not a detailed account of the arguments provided.

Similarly, point 6.1 of appellant II's appeal brief indicates in a general way that the claimed subject matter lacks inventive step in view of documents D7 or D8, alone or in combination with one of documents D18, D2, D10, or D11. In the written phase of the opposition proceedings, appellant II had considered that D8 was the closest prior art. D7 was only considered to constitute the closest prior art during the oral proceedings before the opposition division.

The arguments on which appellant II's appeal brief is based regarding novelty and inventive step are therefore not presented clearly and concisely. But above all, these arguments had been rebutted by the opposition division in its decision (paragraphs 37 to 40 and 45), and appellant II did not indicate in its appeal brief the reasons why the opposition division's reasoning was erroneous.

Consequently, the objections of lack of novelty and inventive step were not sufficiently substantiated in the appeal brief. They do not meet the requirements of Article 12(2) RPCR 2007, and, following Article 12(4) RPCR 2007, the Board decided not to take them into consideration.

5.3 Admissibility of novelty and inventive step arguments in the letter of February 20, 2020

On February 20, 2020, i.e., more than three years after the appeal brief, appellant II provided for the first time the precise reasons why the contested decision was, in his opinion, erroneous regarding the aspects of novelty and inventive step. These reasons represent an unjustified modification of the arguments presented by appellant II at a late stage of the proceedings, and their admission would go against procedural economy. Therefore, the Board decided not to admit them (Article 13(1) RPCR 2020).

6. Adaptation of the description

For the purpose of adapting the description of the patent to the claims of auxiliary request 1B, appellant I only modified paragraph [0017]. He considered that it was not necessary to modify paragraph [0009].

Appellant II argued that paragraph [0009] should be modified to eliminate the conditions of the dissolution test of the claimed composition that were no longer part of the invention, notably the fact that fenofibrate is dissolved in a medium of 1000 ml of water supplemented with 0.025 molar sodium lauryl sulfate.

The Board considers that the modification of paragraph [0009] is not necessary. Even though this paragraph discloses two different conditions for determining the solubility of fenofibrate, the passage in question does not indicate that both conditions are part of the invention. Claim 1 is clear in that the dissolution test of the fenofibrate composition is carried out exclusively in a medium consisting of 1200 ml of water supplemented with 2% by weight of polysorbate 80. Therefore, paragraph [0009] contains information that is not part of the invention but could be useful in its context and does not detract from the clarity of the limits of claim 1.

The Board has therefore decided that paragraph [0009] should not be adapted.","Device, For these reasons, it is decided as follows: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2. The case is referred back to the opposition division to maintain the patent in the following version: Description: Pages 2 and 4 to 8 of the patent as granted, Page 3 submitted during the oral proceedings of November 16, 2020, Claims: Numbers 1 to 3 of auxiliary request 1B submitted with the letter dated December 30, 2019, Drawings: Figures 1 and 2 of the patent as granted.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,,"DOC Generici S.r.l., Prof. Hörnchen, Ulrich","Prof. Hörnchen, Ulrich Steinenkreuz 28 53773 Hennef / DE","Vossius & Partner Patentanwälte Rechtsanwälte mbB, et al, et al Siebertstrasse 3 81675 München / DE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VII. In a first additional letter, the appellant provided arguments regarding the admissibility of documents D8-D10 and objected to the corrections made in the auxiliary requests.

VIII. In a letter responding to the appellant's letter, the respondent submitted counterarguments on each point discussed by the appellant in its latest letter.

IX. A notification from the Board of Appeal established in accordance with Article 15(1) RPCR was issued in preparation for the oral proceedings.

X. In a second additional letter, the appellant submitted further arguments against the inventive step of the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request and the auxiliary requests.

XI. The oral proceedings scheduled for July 9, 2020, were canceled, and the parties were subsequently summoned to attend oral proceedings on July 27, 2021.

XII. With the letter dated May 28, 2021, the respondent informed the board and the appellant of its absence from the oral proceedings. It submitted a set of descriptions adapted to each of the auxiliary requests.

XIII. The oral proceedings took place on July 27, 2021, in the absence of the respondent in accordance with Rule 115(2) EPC and Article 15(3) RPCR 2020.

XIV. The following arguments, insofar as they are relevant to the present decision, were put forward by the appellant.

Admissibility of documents D8 to D10

- Documents D8 to D10 were documents on click chemistry-type cycloaddition reactions used in various technical fields of chemistry such as molecular biology, drug development, biotechnology, macromolecular chemistry, or materials science.

- In the summons to the oral proceedings, the opposition division indicated that the skilled person would have considered documents D3 and D4 for a potential solution to the problem posed by the patent.

- In its decision, the opposition division changed its mind and considered that documents D3 and D4 belonged to a technical field that the skilled person would not have considered to solve the technical problem (point 4.8 of the decision).

- The submission of documents D8 to D10 with the statement of grounds of appeal represented a legitimate reaction to this change of opinion regarding the use of click chemistry-type cycloaddition reactions in different fields of chemistry.

- Documents D8 to D10 should be admitted into the proceedings.

Inventive Step

- D2 was considered the closest document to the invention. The thermally activated preparation of compound NP6e represented the process of D2 that was closest to the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request.

- The distinguishing feature was the implementation of a click chemistry-type cycloaddition reaction between a constrained cycloalkyne and an azide.

- The objective technical problem was to provide a method for modifying the surface of a semiconductor nanocrystal involving a click chemistry-type cycloaddition reaction that could be performed at a lower (physiological) temperature.

- The solution proposed by the claims was obvious in view of D3, which proposed click chemistry-type cycloaddition reactions performed at physiological temperature.

- The subject matter of claims 1 and 11 did not involve an inventive step.

- Even considering the preparation involving a click chemistry-type cycloaddition reaction product obtained by catalytic initiation using copper bromide as the starting point for the problem-solution analysis, no inventive step could be recognized. The distinguishing feature was also the implementation of a click chemistry-type cycloaddition reaction between a constrained cycloalkyne and an azide. The objective technical problem was the development of a surface functionalization method for semiconductor nanocrystals to preserve fluorescence properties. The solution was also obvious in view of D3, which proposed click chemistry-type cycloaddition reactions not involving the use of copper.

- The arguments submitted for claim 1 of the main request applied to the subject matter of claim 1 of each of the auxiliary requests.

XV. The following arguments, insofar as they are relevant to the present decision, were put forward by the respondent.

Admissibility of documents D8 to D10

- Documents D8 to D10 should have been submitted during the proceedings before the opposition division.

- These documents did not describe the implementation of click chemistry-type cycloaddition reactions for semiconductor nanocrystals.

- Documents D8 to D10 should not be admitted into the proceedings.

Inventive Step

- D2 was considered the closest document to the invention, as it related to the surface functionalization of fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals.

- The invention, based on a click chemistry-type cycloaddition reaction between an azide and a constrained cycloalkyne, differed from the teaching of D2 in that it proposed a distinct method for surface functionalization of semiconductor nanocrystals.

- The method proposed according to the invention, operated under mild conditions, significantly preserved the photoluminescence properties of the semiconductor nanocrystals, as demonstrated in the examples of the patent.

- The objective technical problem was to develop a method for surface functionalization of semiconductor nanocrystals to preserve fluorescence properties.

- D3 and D4 belonged to a technical field different from that considered by the invention and would not have been considered by the skilled person. The problem of preserving the fluorescence of semiconductor nanocrystals did not arise in the field of biomolecules to which D3 and D4 pertained.

- The skilled person could not have anticipated the effectiveness of the click chemistry-type cycloaddition reaction of an azide with a constrained cycloalkyne for functionalizing semiconductor nanocrystals without affecting their fluorescence properties. The quantum yield was influenced by the functionalization of semiconductor nanocrystals, as taught by D6 (page 3142, second sentence of the introduction) and D7 (page 5132), such that the quantum yield of the functionalized semiconductor nanocrystal from a constrained cycloalkyne could not be anticipated.

- The claimed subject matter involved an inventive step.

XVI. The requests of the parties were as follows:

- The appellant requested the annulment of the decision of the opposition division and the revocation of the patent in its entirety.

- The respondent requested the dismissal of the appeal, implying the maintenance of the decision and the rejection of the opposition. It requested, as an auxiliary measure, the maintenance of the patent in modified form according to any of auxiliary requests 1, 2, 2bis, 3, 4, 4bis, and 5, the claims of which were submitted with the response to the appeal statement and the adapted description with the letter of May 28, 2021. Additionally, it requested that documents D8 to D10 not be admitted into the appeal proceedings.","Reasons for the decision

Main request: claims 1 to 13 as granted

1. Admissibility of documents D8 to D10

1.1 Documents D8 to D10 were submitted by the applicant with their statement of grounds of appeal. Documents D8 to D10 are documents representing the general knowledge of the skilled person and disclosing ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reactions. These reactions are used in several technical fields of chemistry such as molecular biology, drug development, biotechnology, macromolecular chemistry, or materials science (see in particular the combination of document D8 and the introduction of D9).

1.2 The respondent requested that these documents not be admitted into the appeal proceedings.

1.3 Since the statement of grounds of appeal was filed before January 1, 2020, the admissibility of documents D8 to D10 is subject to the criteria defined in Article 12(4) RPCR 2007 in light of the transitional provisions specified in Article 25(2) RPCR 2020.

The board notes that, in its summons to oral proceedings, the opposition division indicated that the skilled person competent in the field of the invention in question, namely that of semiconductor nanocrystals, would have considered documents D3 and D4 for a potential solution to the problem posed by the patent. Documents D3 and D4, which disclosed ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reactions involving cyclooctynes for the modification of biomolecules, were considered to belong to technical fields adjacent to that of the invention in question (point 4.8 of the annex to the summons to oral proceedings).

In its decision, the opposition division changed its mind. It reasoned that documents D3 and D4 belonged to a different technical field than that of the invention, and that the skilled person would not have considered these documents to find a solution to the posed problem (point 4.8 of the decision).

Thus, the opponent could neither foresee nor react to this change of opinion by the opposition division regarding whether the skilled person working in the field of semiconductor nanocrystals would have considered ""click chemistry"" cycloaddition reactions disclosed in the fields addressed in D8 to D10. They therefore had no opportunity during the proceedings before the opposition division to submit documents D8 to D10 showing that ""click chemistry"" reactions are not limited to the field of semiconductor nanocrystals or the field of biomolecules and are part of the general knowledge of the skilled person.

Consequently, the submission of documents D8 to D10 with the statement of grounds of appeal represents a legitimate reaction to this change of opinion by the opposition division during the oral proceedings, and the board decided to admit these documents into the appeal proceedings according to Article 12(4) RPCR 2007.

2. Inventive step - Articles 100 a) and 56 EPC

2.1 The applicant believes that the claimed subject matter does not involve an inventive step considering D2 as the closest prior art in combination with D3.

2.2 The patent relates to fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals and a method for preparing them to achieve external surface grafting of semiconductor nanocrystals without affecting their photoluminescent and more particularly fluorescent properties (paragraphs [0001] and [0026]).

2.3 The subject matter of claim 1 relates to a method for modifying the surface of a semiconductor nanocrystal. The surface modification is implemented using a ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction involving a cycloalkynyl radical and an azide.

A ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction in the context of the patent is a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between a cycloalkyne and an azide leading to the formation of a 1,2,3-triazole ring according to the following scheme:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

2.4 Document D2 discloses the modification of the surface of luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals. Synthesis schemes 1 and 2 (""scheme 2"" on page 2126) describe ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reactions involving a semiconductor nanocrystal whose surface is functionalized with a linear alkynyl group (see in particular compound NP2 in scheme 2). This functionalized semiconductor nanocrystal NP2 is then brought into contact with an azide to provide, during a thermally initiated reaction or by copper bromide, a reaction product comprising a triazole ring (see compounds NP6a-e and the notes of schemes 1 and 2).

Since D2 (abstract) has the same objective as the contested patent, namely the surface functionalization of fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals, the board considers, in agreement with the parties, that D2 constitutes the closest prior art for assessing the inventive step of the subject matter of claim 1.

The emission spectrum of compound NP6e, prepared thermally (left column of page 2128 of D2), is described in figure 3b. Since this compound is a fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystal, whose surface has been modified using a ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction, its preparation represents the process of D2 that is closest to the subject matter of claim 1.

2.5 Distinctive features

Considering the preparation of compound NP6e disclosed in D2, a compound whose surface is thermally functionalized with a linear alkynyl group, the distinctive feature of claim 1 is the implementation of a ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction between an alkyne and an azide, in which the alkyne is a constrained cycloalkyne.

2.6 Assessment of the technical effect obtained by the distinctive feature

Example 1 of the patent describes the synthesis of a modified nanocrystal comprising a cyclooctynyl radical (constrained cycloalkyne), see paragraph [0118].

This modified nanocrystal is then functionalized by a ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction between the cyclooctynyl radical and an azide Ac4ManNAz (compound AB3 functionalized into compound AB4, scheme in paragraph [0130]). The ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction is performed at room temperature (paragraph [0132]). This reaction corresponds to the ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction involved in the process of claim 1.

In D2, the equivalent ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction on compound NP2 to obtain compound NP6e is performed at 95°C (notes of scheme 2 of D2).

2.7 The respondent contested this approach by asserting that the method proposed by the patent was selective compared to thermally induced ""click chemistry"" cycloaddition reactions in D2 that led to lower selectivity since two isomers NP6e and NP6e' were obtained, and the latter exhibited an even lower quantum yield (0.38%) compared to the former (0.55%).

The board considers that these arguments are not relevant for the following reasons.

The production of two isomers in D2 (NP6e and NP6e', figure 3a of D2) is due to the modification of one of the functions of the substituent R' of the azide R'-N3 (transformation of the spiropyran function into merocyanine) and not to the nature of the alkyne NP2 (scheme 2). It has not been shown that any difference in selectivity was solely due to the presence of the distinctive feature, namely the presence of a constrained cycloalkynyl moiety.

Therefore, the only effect obtained by the distinctive feature is the realization of the ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction at room temperature (paragraph [0132] of the patent), whereas the equivalent reaction is performed at 95°C in D2 (notes of scheme 2 of D2).

2.8 Objective technical problem

For these reasons, the board concludes that the objective technical problem with respect to D2 is to provide a method for modifying the surface of a semiconductor nanocrystal involving a ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction that can be performed at a lower (physiological) temperature.

2.9 Evidence of the solution

Document D3 (figure 1 and scheme 1) describes the modification of biomolecules by ""click chemistry"" type reactions. It discloses ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reactions involving a constrained cycloalkyne (a cyclooctyne derivative) and reactive towards an azide. The reaction is performed under physiological conditions (penultimate sentence of the third paragraph of the left column of page 15046: ""Here we report that the [3+2] cycloaddition of azides and cyclooctyne derivatives [Figure 1B] occurs readily under physiological conditions in the absence of auxiliary reagents"").

The skilled person would therefore have found in the teaching provided by D3 the solution to the above-stated objective problem. In seeking a reaction that could be performed at a lower temperature, they would have adapted the process described in D2 by using a cyclooctynyl derivative instead of the linear alkyne. They would have arrived at the subject matter of claim 1 without exercising inventive ingenuity.

2.10 The respondent argued that the skilled person, starting from D2, would not have considered D3, as D3 belonged to a different technical field where the problem of preserving the fluorescence of semiconductor nanocrystals was not addressed in that document.

The board does not share the respondent's view. First, even though D3 does not describe semiconductor nanocrystals, D3 mentions fluorescent glycoproteins (third paragraph of page 15047) and ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reactions involving cycloalkynes and azides, thus constituting a neighboring field to that of the patent.

Moreover, as explained above, D3 is concerned with the problem of providing a ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction that can be performed at a physiological temperature. Thus, the problem identified in D3 is related to that underlying the subject matter of claim 1, namely to provide a ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction that can be performed at a physiological temperature.

Thus, the board is of the opinion that D3 does not constitute a technical field that the skilled person, faced with the technical problem, would not have considered.

For these reasons, the subject matter of claim 1 does not involve an inventive step.

2.11 The same conclusion would apply when considering the alternative of D2 involving a ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction product obtained by catalytic initiation using copper bromide as the starting point for the problem-solution analysis.

The distinctive feature of claim 1 would also be the implementation of a ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction between an alkyne and an azide, in which the alkyne is a constrained cycloalkyne.

The effect obtained by the distinctive feature is shown in the examples of the patent.

Figure 1 of the contested patent shows the quantum yields of fluorescence of the following compounds (see the figure on page 12 of the patent):

- AB1: semiconductor nanocrystal functionalized with a linear alkyne group

- AB3: semiconductor nanocrystal functionalized with a cyclooctynyl group

- AB2: the reaction product of ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition of AB1 with an azide catalytically initiated by copper (I) as described in D2

- AB4: the reaction product of ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition of AB3 with an azide (product obtained according to the process of claim 1).

Figure 1 shows that the decrease in quantum yield of compound AB4 compared to its precursor AB3 (decrease from 100% to about 80%) is less compared to the decrease in quantum yield observed for compound AB2 compared to its precursor AB1 (decrease from 100% to about 50%).

Consequently, the distinctive feature is associated with better preservation of quantum yield.

Thus, the objective technical problem would be the development of a method for surface functionalization of semiconductor nanocrystals to preserve fluorescence properties.

The solution would also be obvious in light of D3 for the following reasons. D2 teaches that semiconductor nanocrystals functionalized by a ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction initiated by copper bromide have a significant decrease in photoluminescence quantum yield (""dramatic decreases of PL-QY""), a decrease explained by the presence of residual copper (I) ions (page 2128, first paragraph of the right column: ""demonstrating the quenching of the fluorescence due to the presence of residual Cu(I) ions.""). The skilled person, faced with the problem of finding a means to preserve fluorescence, would know that copper should be eliminated and would have sought an alternative ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction excluding the presence of copper. They would find such an alternative in the teaching of D3. Indeed, as stated in point 2.9, D3 proposes ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reactions of azides in the presence of a cyclooctyne derivative induced without the presence of copper (I).

Thus, the solution proposed by D3 would also be obvious to the skilled person who would have applied it to the problem posed by D2.

2.12 The respondent provided the argument that the skilled person could not have predicted the effectiveness of a ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction between an azide and a constrained cycloalkyne without affecting fluorescence properties. The quantum yield was influenced by the functionalization of semiconductor nanocrystals, as taught by D6 (page 3142, second sentence of the introduction) and D7 (page 5132), such that the quantum yield of the semiconductor nanocrystal functionalized from a constrained cycloalkyne could not be anticipated.

The board does not share this view. As explained in D2, the decrease in fluorescence is related to the presence of copper (I) ions. It is therefore clear from D2 that the absence of copper (I) will not affect the fluorescence properties of the semiconductor nanocrystal. Furthermore, document D3 shows that functionalization using a ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction involving a cyclooctyne allows for the production of fluorescent compounds (third paragraph of page 15047), suggesting that fluorescence properties are not significantly affected.

2.13 For these reasons, the subject matter of claim 1 does not involve an inventive step either when considering the alternative of D2 disclosing a reaction product comprising a triazole ring obtained by catalytic initiation using copper bromide as the starting point for the problem-solution analysis.

Auxiliary requests 1, 2, 2bis, 3, 4, 4bis, and 5

3. These were filed with the response to the statement of grounds of appeal. The respondent provided no additional arguments compared to those given for the main request regarding the inventive step of the subject matter of claim 1 of each of the auxiliary requests.

3.1 Auxiliary request 1

This request corresponds to auxiliary request 1 filed on June 2, 2016, in the first instance and essentially corresponds to the main request in which a technical term and certain typographical errors have been removed:

- the expression ""of two reactive functions"" at the end of the definition of the radical ""X"" in claim 2 has been removed.

- one of the terms ""and,"" present twice in claim 2 (between the definitions of ""A"" and ""G"") has been removed.

- A missing comma between the terms ""the fluorophores"" and ""the linkers"" has been added in claim 10.

These modifications do not limit the scope compared to claim 1 of the main request.

The reasons given for the lack of inventive step regarding the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request therefore apply to the subject matter of auxiliary request 1.

3.2 Auxiliary request 2

Claim 1 of this request results from the combination of claims 1, 3, and 4 of the main request: the group G1 is the constrained cycloalkynyl radical which itself is a cyclooctynyl radical.

The corrections discussed above for auxiliary request 1 have been reproduced for this auxiliary request 2.

The reasons given for the lack of inventive step of the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request also apply to the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 for the following reasons.

The distinctive feature of the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 is the implementation of a ""click chemistry"" type cycloaddition reaction between an alkyne and an azide, in which the alkyne is a cyclooctynyl radical.

The objective technical problem remains the same as that formulated for claim 1 of the main request (point 2.8 above).

As D3 describes a cyclooctynyl group (in particular figure 1 and scheme 1 of D3, point 2.9 above), the solution to the objective problem remains obvious with respect to D3.

The claim of auxiliary request 2 does not involve an inventive step.

3.3 Auxiliary request 2bis

Auxiliary request 2bis corresponds to auxiliary request 2, in which the modifications made for auxiliary request 1 have not been reproduced.

For the same reasons as those given for auxiliary request 2, the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 2bis does not involve an inventive step.

3.4 Auxiliary request 3

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 results from the combination of claims 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the main request.

Claim 8 of auxiliary request 3 results from the combination of claims 11, 12, and 13 of the main request.

In claims 1 and 8 of this auxiliary request, the organic coating layer of the semiconductor nanocrystal corresponds to the general formula (I):

(I)    L-X-E-A-G1

3.5 Such a definition is derivable from the combination of D2 and D3:

Starting from compound NP2 (see the formula in point 2.3 above), precursor of compound NP6e, and considering that the skilled person would replace the linear alkyne with a cyclooctynyl group (see the argumentation for auxiliary request 2 above), the compound derived from this combination would include the following functions according to the general formula (I):

- the phosphine oxide group corresponds to L

- X is the acyl group -OCO-

- E is the propylene group -CH2-CH2-CH2-

- A is a single bond

- G1 is the cyclooctynyl group.

Thus, considering the above analysis and the reasons given for the main request, the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 also does not involve an inventive step.

3.6 Auxiliary requests 4 and 4bis

Auxiliary request 4 includes claims 1 to 8 of the process from auxiliary requests 2; claims 9 and 10 of the product are deleted.

Auxiliary request 4bis corresponds to auxiliary request 4, in which the modifications made for auxiliary request 1 have not been reproduced.

For the same reasons as those given for auxiliary request 2, the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary requests 4 and 4bis does not involve an inventive step.

3.7 Auxiliary request 5

Auxiliary request 5 includes claims 1 to 7 of the process from auxiliary request 3, claim 8 of the product is deleted.

Since claim 1 of this request corresponds to claim 1 of auxiliary request 3, the same reasons as those given for auxiliary request 3 apply to the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 5, which does not involve an inventive step.","Device, For these reasons, it is ruled as follows: 1.

I. The applicant (patent owner) has filed an appeal against the interim decision of the opposition division establishing that European patent No. 2 104 486 could be maintained based on claims 1 to 10 of auxiliary request 2 received on March 30, 2016, in electronic form.

Claim 1 of the patent as granted reads as follows:

""1. A method for coloring human hair comprising applying to the hair without prior treatment a coloring composition which comprises one or more natural dyes selected from orceins, lawsone, juglone, alizarin, purpurin, carminic acid, kermesic acid, purpurogallin, protocatechaldehyde, indigo, curcumin, spinulosine, apigenin, chlorophyllin, sorghum orceins, and cochineal carmine and benzyl alcohol for a sufficient time to achieve the desired coloration, optionally followed by a rinsing step.""

II. Oppositions were filed by respondents I and II (opponents (1) and (2) respectively) seeking the revocation of the patent in its entirety for lack of novelty and inventive step (Article 100(a) EPC) and for extension of the subject matter of the patent beyond the content of the application as filed (Article 100(c) EPC).

According to the opposition division, claim 1 of the patent as granted was based on the method of claim 17 of the application as filed in which the composition was restricted to a composition comprising one or more natural dyes chosen from the dye list of claim 2, excluding isatin, and benzyl alcohol. Claim 13 defined three solvents including benzyl alcohol which is introduced into the coloring composition of the method of claim 1. Claim 13 was dependent on claim 2. Each of the solvents described in claim 13 was therefore associated with each of the dyes in claim 2. All specific solvent-dye combinations as defined in claim 1 of the patent as granted were recognized directly and unambiguously by the skilled person not only because of the interdependence of the claims but also because the solvents and natural dyes were mandatory elements of the compositions of the invention as described in the application as filed. Thus, claim 1 of the patent as granted did not extend the subject matter beyond the content of the application as filed.

However, the subject matter of claim 1 of the patent as granted lacked novelty, while the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 did not involve an inventive step.

The claims of auxiliary request 2 met the requirements of the EPC and the patent could therefore be maintained on this basis.

III. In its appeal brief, the applicant contested the opposition division's conclusions regarding the lack of novelty and inventive step of the claimed method. It also filed auxiliary requests 1 to 5 which differ from the main request in that the list of natural dyes is successively restricted.

Thus, in claim 1 of auxiliary request 1, the natural dyes are chosen from orceins, lawsone, juglone, alizarin, purpurin, carminic acid, kermesic acid, purpurogallin, protocatechaldehyde, indigo, curcumin, spinulosine, apigenin, sorghum orceins, and cochineal carmine.

In claim 1 of auxiliary request 2, the natural dyes are chosen from orceins, lawsone, alizarin, carminic acid, kermesic acid, and cochineal carmine.

In claim 1 of auxiliary request 3, the natural dyes are chosen from orceins, lawsone, alizarin, carminic acid, kermesic acid, sorghum, and cochineal carmine.

In claim 1 of auxiliary request 4, the natural dyes are chosen from orceins, lawsone, alizarin, and carminic acid.

In claim 1 of auxiliary request 5, the natural dyes are chosen from orceins and carminic acid.

IV. In its letter in response to the appeal brief dated April 4, 2017, respondent I contested, among other things, the opposition division's conclusions that the claims of the patent as granted did not extend the subject matter of the patent beyond the content of the application as filed. According to respondent I, claim 1 of the patent as granted resulted from a multiple selection that had no basis in the application as filed. Therefore, claim 1 of the patent as granted did not comply with the provisions of Article 123(2) EPC.

V. In a letter dated September 21, 2017, the applicant argued that claim 1 of the application as filed disclosed a method comprising a natural dye and an organic solvent. All examples of the present patent described compositions comprising both a natural dye and an organic solvent. Claim 2 of the application as filed disclosed the list of natural dyes with only one exception in claim 1 of the patent as granted. Claim 13, dependent among others on claim 2, described the organic solvents. Due to the dependency of the claims, all specific dye-solvent combinations were covered by the application as filed and, consequently, each combination was disclosed therein. Thus, the removal of natural dyes (claim 2) and organic solvents (claim 13) resulted in the removal of certain dye-solvent combinations without leading to specific combinations that were not initially described. Therefore, the claims of the patent as granted and of auxiliary requests 1 to 5 were compliant with Article 123(2) EPC.

VI. In a notification dated April 11, 2019, accompanying the summons to oral proceedings set for January 8, 2020, the Board observed that:

""The application as filed provides as natural dye the individual dyes listed in claim 1 of the patent as granted (see claim 2 of the application as filed) and as solvent, among others, benzyl alcohol (see claim 13 of the application as filed).

However, by restricting the list of solvents to benzyl alcohol alone and the dyes to 16 individual dyes, claim 1 of the patent as granted individualizes specific dye-solvent combinations, namely the combinations of benzyl alcohol with each of the 16 individual dyes. These specific pairs, however, are not disclosed in the application as filed which provides that the composition contains at least one solvent chosen from propylene glycol ethers, benzyl alcohol, and alkylene carbonates (claim 17), but does not define which solvent is combined with which natural dye. Thus, the specific combination of benzyl alcohol with each of the 16 natural dyes, the subject of claim 1 of the patent as granted, cannot be directly and unambiguously derived from the application as filed.

Therefore, claim 1 of the patent as granted appears to extend the subject matter of the patent beyond the content of the application as filed and does not seem to satisfy the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

Claim 1 according to auxiliary requests 1 to 5 differs from claim 1 of the patent as granted by restrictions in the list of natural dyes. Therefore, the situation remains the same as for the main request in that claim 1 of these auxiliary requests also individualizes particular dye/solvent associations that are not disclosed in the application as filed.""

VII. In a letter dated November 8, 2019, respondent II announced that it would not participate in the oral proceedings on January 8, 2020.

VIII. In a letter dated December 9, 2019, respondent I announced that it would not participate in the oral proceedings on January 8, 2020.

IX. In a letter dated December 18, 2019, the applicant announced that it would not participate in the oral proceedings on January 8, 2020.

X. The applicant requested in writing the annulment of the decision of the opposition division and the maintenance of the patent as granted, or alternatively, the maintenance of the patent based on the claims according to auxiliary requests 1 to 5 filed with the letter setting out the grounds of appeal dated November 28, 2016.

Respondent I requested the dismissal of the appeal.

Respondent II did not submit any requests in the appeal proceedings.

XI. The Board rendered its decision at the end of the oral proceedings held on January 8, 2020, in the absence of the parties.","Reasons for the decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

2. In the notification dated April 11, 2019, accompanying the summons to oral proceedings scheduled for January 8, 2020, the Board indicated that claims 1 of the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 5 do not appear to satisfy the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

3. In response to this notification, the applicant informed the Board that he would not participate in the oral proceedings on January 8, 2020.

4. Consequently, the Board has no reason to deviate from the reasons stated in this notification, which led it to conclude that the claims of the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 5 do not comply with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC (see point VI of the statement of facts and conclusions above).

I. The applicant (opponent) has filed an appeal against the interim decision of the opposition division stating that European patent No. 1 968 711 could be maintained in the form of auxiliary request 1 filed on March 16, 2016, during the oral proceedings before the opposition division.

II. The applicant had filed an opposition seeking the revocation of the patent in its entirety for lack of inventive step and industrial applicability (Article 100(a) EPC) and for insufficient disclosure of the invention (Article 100(b) EPC).

III. Auxiliary request 1 filed on March 16, 2016, comprises four claims, namely independent product claims 1 and 2, identical to claims 1 and 2 of the patent as granted, as well as independent process claim 3 and dependent claim 4 of claim 3.

According to the opposition division, the subject matter of claims 1 and 2 was sufficiently disclosed to be manufactured and implemented industrially. It therefore rejected the grounds for opposition relating to industrial applicability (Article 100(a) EPC in combination with Article 57 EPC) and insufficient disclosure of the invention (Article 100(b) EPC). Claim 3 of auxiliary request 1 met the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, and its subject matter was novel and did not result in an obvious manner from the cited documents. The same conclusions applied to dependent claim 4. The opposition division found that claims 1 and 2 had not been objected to by the opponent for lack of inventive step.

Consequently, the opposition division concluded that the contested patent could be maintained in amended form based on claims 1 to 4 of auxiliary request 1.

IV. The applicant filed an appeal against this decision and requested that the decision be annulled and the patent revoked.

In his statement of grounds of appeal dated November 18, 2016, the applicant contested the conclusions of the opposition division only regarding the patentability of process claims 3 and 4, namely that independent claim 3 did not comply with the provisions of Article 123(2) EPC and that the subject matter of claims 3 and 4 lacked inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

V. In his letter in response to the statement of grounds of appeal dated April 5, 2017, the respondent (patent owner) requested that the appeal be dismissed or, alternatively, that the patent be maintained in the form of auxiliary requests 1 to 5 attached to said letter.

VI. In a letter dated October 2, 2018, the applicant submitted that the subject matter of independent claim 3 of all requests extended the subject matter of the patent beyond the content of the application as filed and did not involve an inventive step.

VII. By a summons dated December 18, 2019, the parties were invited to attend oral proceedings on November 24, 2020.

VIII. In a notification dated April 24, 2020, issued in accordance with Article 15(1) RPBA, the Board noted that the only contentious point of the appeal concerned claim 3 of auxiliary request 1 maintained by the opposition division and issued a preliminary opinion that the subject matter of this claim did not involve an inventive step.

IX. In a letter dated October 23, 2020, the respondent withdrew his main request, with auxiliary request 1 then pending becoming the new main request and auxiliary requests 5, 3, and 7 then pending becoming respectively auxiliary requests 1 to 3. The respondent also submitted with the same letter an auxiliary request 4 comprising only claims 1 and 2 of the request maintained by the opposition division.

X. During the oral proceedings before the Board held on November 24, 2020, the applicant requested that auxiliary request 4 submitted with a letter dated October 23, 2020, not be admitted into the appeal proceedings due to the lateness of its submission without compelling reasons. If this request were to be admitted into the appeal proceedings, he requested that the Board consider the argument that the subject matter of claims 1 and 2 lacked inventive step for the same reasons as process claim 3 of the other requests and therefore reject this request for lack of inventive step. The applicant argued that the Board's discretion to admit or not admit a late request would not be exercised reasonably if the Board accepted auxiliary request 4 into the appeal proceedings without allowing the applicant to challenge it on the merits, as his right to be heard would then not be respected.

During the oral proceedings, the respondent withdrew his main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 3.

XI. The applicant (opponent) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

The respondent (patent owner) requested the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent based on the request submitted as auxiliary request 4 with a letter dated October 23, 2020.

XII. The Board rendered its decision at the conclusion of the oral proceedings.","Reasons for the decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

Admissibility of auxiliary request 4 filed with a letter dated October 20, 2020

2. The applicant opposed the admission of this request into the appeal proceedings, citing its late filing and the fact that the respondent had not provided convincing reasons justifying this filing.

2.1 The summons to the oral proceedings before the Board of Appeal is dated December 18, 2019, before the entry into force of the new Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (RPCR 2020). According to Article 25, paragraph 3, which sets out the transitional provisions of the RPCR 2020, Article 13 RPCR 2007 continues to apply to amendments to claims made by the parties.

2.2 The amendments made in this late request consist of the deletion of method claims 3 and 4 from the set of claims maintained by the opposition division, which were the only contentious point in the appeal proceedings. This amendment thus resolves all contentious points of the appeal proceedings without raising additional questions.

2.3 In these circumstances, the Board therefore decides to admit this request into the appeal proceedings (Article 13(1) and (3) RPCR 2007) - (see also T 2097/10; point 3 of the reasons; not published OJ EPO).

2.4 According to the applicant, the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal opposed the admission of this late request into the appeal proceedings since no convincing reason justifying its late filing was invoked by the respondent.

However, the applicant refers to requirements set forth in Article 13(2) of the RPCR 2020, whereas in this case it is still the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal in their 2007 version that apply (see point above).

Article 13 of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal 2007 does not require such convincing reasons. Therefore, the applicant's argument must be dismissed.

Admissibility of objections against claims 1 and 2 in the appeal proceedings

3. During the oral proceedings before the Board, the applicant requested that objections of lack of inventive step against claims 1 and 2 be admitted into the appeal proceedings.

3.1 The legal and factual framework of an appeal is based on the notice of appeal and the statement of grounds of appeal in which the applicant must present the reasons for which the contested decision should be annulled or the extent to which it should be modified, as well as the facts and evidence on which the appeal is based (Rule 99(2) EPC).

3.2 In this case, the applicant based his appeal solely on the fact that claim 3 was not compliant with the EPC. The statement of appeal does not include any objection against claims 1 and 2 which were deemed admissible by the opposition division.

The applicant did not challenge the merits of the opposition division's decision regarding product claims 1 and 2, noting that these claims had not been subject to objections of lack of inventive step.

Therefore, the request to introduce an objection against claims 1 and 2 maintained by the opposition division during the oral proceedings before the Board substantially changes the framework of the appeal, which only concerned the patentability of independent claim 3 and dependent claim 4.

3.3 On the other hand, the Board informed the parties in the notification dated April 24, 2020, issued in accordance with Article 15(1) RPCR (see point 5), that the only contentious point concerned the patentability of independent claim 3, and it was only during the oral proceedings before the Board that the applicant attempted to introduce an objection against claims 1 and 2.

3.4 In these circumstances, the Board decides not to admit this new objection into the appeal proceedings.

3.5 According to the applicant, before the filing of the late request, he could obtain the revocation of the patent by attacking only claim 3 present in all pending requests. The admission of auxiliary request 4 into the appeal proceedings required him to attack claims 1 and 2 in order to obtain the revocation of the patent. He should therefore have been allowed to challenge claims 1 and 2 of the late-filed auxiliary request 4 during the oral proceedings before the Board.

3.6 However, it is not the lateness of the filing of auxiliary request 4 that put the applicant in a position where he could not object to the substance of claims 1 and 2 to obtain the revocation of the patent, but rather the fact that he did not challenge them, neither before the opposition division (see point 7.12 of the contested decision), nor in his statement of grounds of appeal.

3.7 According to the applicant, the Board would not exercise its discretionary power reasonably by admitting a new request into the appeal proceedings without allowing the applicant to comment on its patentability. The applicant states that his right to be heard is not respected, as he cannot raise substantive objections against a late request admitted into the appeal proceedings. On the other hand, this objection did not add any new facts and could have been addressed during the oral proceedings, as the objections raised regarding the lack of inventive step for the subject matter of claim 3 also applied to claims 1 and 2.

However, while the deletion of the method claims ends the only objections raised in the statement of appeal, the new objections of the applicant change the factual and legal framework of the appeal. The Board therefore believes that it is exercising its discretionary power reasonably by not admitting these objections.

The applicant has been heard on the admissibility of the objections against claims 1 and 2. Since these objections are not admitted into the appeal proceedings, there is no need to hear the applicant's arguments that the subject matter of claims 1 and 2 lacks inventive step.

4. The respondent having withdrawn the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 3 pending during the oral proceedings before the Board, auxiliary request 4 remains the only request in the appeal proceedings. This request includes only claims 1 and 2 of auxiliary request 1 maintained by the opposition division.

The opposition division concluded that the subject matter of claims 1 and 2 was sufficiently disclosed for it to be manufactured and implemented industrially and that claims 1 and 2 had not been subject to objections of inventive step from the opponent.

Claims 1 and 2 of auxiliary request 1 maintained by the opposition division were not challenged in the statement of appeal. On the other hand, the late objection of lack of inventive step by the applicant against these claims is not admitted in the proceedings.

In these circumstances, the Board has no reason to diverge from the conclusions of the opposition division in the contested decision regarding claims 1 and 2.","Device, For these reasons, it is decided as follows: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2. The case is referred back to the first instance with the order to maintain the patent based on claims 1 and 2 of the auxiliary request 4 filed with the letter dated October 23, 2020, and a description to be adapted accordingly.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,,"ALLERGAN, INC.","ALLERGAN, INC. 2525 Dupont Drive Irvine CA 92612 / US","Hoffmann Eitle, et al, et al Patent- und Rechtsanwälte PartmbB Arabellastraße 30 81925 München / DE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. European Patent No. 1 944 009 was granted based on 21 claims. The wording of independent claim 1 was as follows:

""1. Composition for the bleaching of keratin fibers, in the form of an anhydrous paste, comprising at least one peroxygenated salt and at least one non-volatile branched liquid carboxylic acid ester having a solidification point determined by DSC of less than 4 °C chosen from the compounds of the following formula (I):

R1CO-O-R2 (I)

wherein R1 and R2 independently denote a hydrocarbon chain of C1-C30 which may be interrupted by one or more oxygen atoms and/or by one or more carbonyl groups and may be substituted by one or more hydroxy groups, R1 being branched.""

II. The patent was opposed on the grounds of Article 100(a) EPC for lack of inventive step, and Article 100(b) EPC for insufficiently clear and complete disclosure of the invention for a person skilled in the art to carry it out. The following documents cited during the opposition proceedings remain relevant for the present decision:

D1: Pure & Applied Chemistry; 1995, 67, 1789-1800

D2: FR 2 842 099

D8: Comparative tests submitted for examination

III. The present appeal by the opponent (appellant) is directed against the decision of the opposition division to reject the opposition.

According to the decision of the opposition division:

a) The appellant had not provided evidence that raised serious doubts regarding the sufficiency of the disclosure in the patent concerning the determination of the melting point by DSC. This parameter was therefore disclosed in a sufficiently clear and complete manner to allow a person skilled in the art to carry out the invention.

b) Regarding inventive step, document D2 was considered the closest prior art. The composition of the patent differed from the compositions of document D2 by the presence of a non-volatile branched liquid ester as defined in the first claim. The technical problem could be formulated as the improvement of the low-temperature stability of a bleaching composition in the form of an anhydrous paste comprising a persulfate. The solution proposed by the patent was not derivable from prior art D4. Therefore, the subject matter of the patent involved an inventive step.

IV. The statement of grounds of appeal by the appellant was accompanied by the following documents:

D10: JAOCS, 83(6), 2006, 547-552

D11: Introducing Pemulen® polymeric emulsifiers

D12: Technical data sheet TDS-224 - Lubrizol

V. In its response to the statement of grounds of appeal, filed on July 31, 2017, the patent holder (respondent) requested the dismissal of the appeal and submitted two auxiliary requests.

VI. For the preparation of the oral proceedings, the Board sent a notification dated September 6, 2019. In this notification, the Board expressed a preliminary positive opinion regarding the sufficiency of the patent. Regarding inventive step, the Board observed that the composition defined in the first claim of the patent was distinguished from the compositions disclosed in D2, chosen as the closest prior art, by the presence of a non-volatile branched liquid ester with a solidification point below 4°C. In the Board's opinion, the tests in D8 showed that replacing a linear ester with a branched ester improved the stability of the composition at low temperatures. It also noted that such an effect would not be suggested in D2.

VII. By letter dated November 7, 2019, the appellant informed the Board that it was withdrawing its request for oral proceedings and would not participate in the proceedings scheduled for January 16, 2020. By fax on December 16, 2019, the Board notified the parties that the oral proceedings were canceled.

VIII. The following arguments were put forward by the appellant:

a) Disclosure of the invention

As explained in D1, the measurement of the solidification point by DSC was related to certain parameters such as the heating and cooling rates. This was also confirmed by documents D6 and D10. The patent did not provide sufficient information regarding the adjustment of these parameters. The person skilled in the art was therefore required to conduct tests to establish whether an ester of formula (I) had a solidification point below 4°C as required by the wording of the first claim. This, however, was contrary to the requirements of sufficiency of disclosure.

b) Inventive step

The closest prior art was document D2. The compositions of the patent differed from this document in that they contained a branched ester as defined in the first claim. The comparative tests D8 of the respondent were not relevant on the grounds that the comparative compositions made by the respondent did not include a non-ionic or anionic amphiphilic polymer as exemplified in D2. The technical problem was therefore the provision of alternative compositions for bleaching keratin fibers. The use of branched esters of formula (I) was already described in D2 and D4. The subject matter of the first claim was therefore devoid of inventive step. The conditions of Article 56 EPC were not met even if the technical problem was formulated as the provision of compositions having better stability, based on the tests of D8. Indeed, document D3c showed that the use of branched esters as defined in the patent increased the stability of cosmetic compositions.

IX. The following arguments were put forward by the respondent:

a) Disclosure of the invention

The solidification temperature was a perfectly clear characteristic for the person skilled in the art. Indeed, D1 disclosed that the DSC method was commonly used and that this method provided accurate results when used properly. All documents relating to the DSC method for determining the solidification temperature simply showed the necessity of performing this measurement according to the rules of the art. Thus, the person skilled in the art wishing to carry out the invention did not have to make unreasonable efforts to identify the branched esters according to the first claim of the patent.

b) Inventive step

The subject matter of the invention was distinguished from D2 by the presence of a non-volatile branched liquid acid ester, whose solidification temperature was below 4°C. As shown by the comparative tests D8, this difference allowed for the obtaining of compositions exhibiting better stability at low temperatures. The objective technical problem was to improve the low-temperature stability of a bleaching composition in the form of an anhydrous paste. A person skilled in the art starting from D2 would not have found any incentive in the prior art to add an ester as defined in the patent to solve this problem. Therefore, the compositions according to the first claim involved an inventive step.

X. The appellant requests the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

XI. The respondent requests the dismissal of the appeal or, alternatively, the maintenance of the patent based on one of the two auxiliary requests filed on July 31, 2017, with the response to the statement of grounds of appeal.","Reasons for the decision

Main request - Patent as granted

1. Article 100(b) EPC

1.1 The applicant objected to an insufficiency in the disclosure of the invention on the grounds that the patent does not contain information for determining the solidification point by DSC. In their opinion, the measurement of this value would depend on a plurality of parameters that the respondent failed to disclose in the patent.

1.2 The Board notes that the patent indicates in paragraph [0027] which DSC apparatus can be used to determine the solidification temperature. According to D1, DSC devices are commonly used and easy to operate (page 1789, lines 1 to 4). D7 (page 33, lines 7-17) confirms that DSC is a well-established technology for the physical characterization of several materials. D1 warns that DSC measurements are influenced by the setting of certain parameters of the device (page 1789, lines 12-19). However, the meaning of this passage from D1 is simply to emphasize the importance of working carefully. In fact, the authors conclude that ""...the accuracy of DSC/DTA results is intimately correlated with the individual knowledge and skill of the operator..."".

1.3 The applicant referred to D6 to note that fatty acid esters are often in the form of a mixture of compounds that do not have a well-defined melting point but rather melt over a range of temperatures (page 31, sixth paragraph). In these cases, it would not be possible to determine the solidification point. However, it is also stated in this paragraph of D6 that in such cases, the melting point is the final temperature of the melting range.

Regarding D10, the Board observes that the passage on page 551 (right column) stating that the cooling rate could influence the polymorphism of fatty acids is presented in the context of a particular method of using DSC that includes several heating and cooling steps and the introduction of a step defined as ""special"" (""...we inserted a special step in the DSC method."" - page 551, left column). In any case, this document does not indicate that a person skilled in the art would have difficulties determining a solidification point by DSC.

1.4 In general, the Board shares the conclusion of the opposition division that the applicant has not provided evidence that raises serious doubts about the ability of a person skilled in the art to determine the solidification point by DSC (point II.1 of the decision).

Therefore, the ground for opposition under Article 100(b) EPC does not oppose the maintenance of the patent as granted.

2. Articles 100(a) and 56 EPC

2.1 Closest prior art

2.1.1 Document D2 was considered the closest prior art by the opposition division in its decision. The Board agrees with this choice, which was not contested by either the applicant or the respondent.

2.1.2 The composition for the decolorization of keratin fibers defined in the first claim of the patent is distinguished from the compositions disclosed in D2 (see examples 1 to 5) by the presence of a branched liquid non-volatile ester with a solidification point below 4°C.

2.2 Objective technical problem

2.2.1 According to the respondent, the problem underlying the present invention is to improve the low-temperature stability of a decolorizing composition in the form of an anhydrous paste. In this regard, they refer to comparative tests D8 which show that a composition according to the invention comprising isononyl isononanoate (branched liquid ester with a solidification point below 4 °C) exhibits better cold resistance than a comparative composition containing the same weight content of isopropyl myristate (linear liquid ester with a solidification point below 4 °C). Isopropyl myristate is mentioned in D2 (page 4, line 27) as one of the preferred esters.

2.2.2 According to the applicant, the tests of D8 would not be relevant because, contrary to the teaching of D2, the comparative compositions do not contain a non-ionic or anionic amphiphilic polymer.

The Board is not convinced by this argument because D2 does not indicate that these polymers have a stabilizing effect at low temperatures. D11 and D12, cited by the applicant in support of the fact that amphiphilic polymers influence stability, do not concern the low-temperature stability of anhydrous pastes. In any case, the presence of such polymers in the compositions according to the invention is also permitted by the first claim of the patent. In the absence of any information on the effects of these polymers, it must be assumed that they have the same effect on the stability of the compositions of D2 and on that of the compositions of the patent.

2.2.3 Since the two compositions tested by the respondent in the D8 tests differ only by the ester used (isononyl isononanoate vs isopropyl myristate), the Board considers that these tests are suitable to show that replacing a linear ester with a branched ester improves the stability of the compositions at low temperatures. Therefore, the technical problem indicated by the respondent (see paragraph 2.2.1) has been solved.

2.3 Evidence of the solution

2.3.1 According to the general teaching of D2, fatty acid esters can be linear or branched (page 4, lines 20-27). However, this document does not indicate that the use of branched esters leads to advantages in terms of stability. Thus, a person skilled in the art would not arrive, based on the teaching of D2, at solving the technical problem by providing the compositions of the first claim.

2.3.2 Regarding the possibility of combining the teaching of D2 with that of D3c or D4, the Board observes the following.

D3c discloses makeup removal compositions based on oils containing branched esters (paragraphs [0006] and [0007]). These compositions are described as having good stability over time. However, D3c does not address the problem of improving low-temperature stability. Furthermore, the Board considers that a person skilled in the art working in the field of anhydrous pastes for hair decolorization would not consult a document concerning oil-based makeup removal compositions.

D4 discloses the optional presence of branched esters in decolorizing pastes. However, this document does not indicate that these compounds have an influence on the stability of the composition.

It follows that the compositions of the first claim involve an inventive step also with respect to D2 combined with D3c or D4.

2.4 The Board therefore concludes that the ground for opposition of lack of inventive step (Article 100(a) and 56 EPC) does not oppose the maintenance of the patent as granted.","Device, For these reasons, it is ruled as follows, The appeal is dismissed.",opposition rejected,opposition rejected,appeal dismissed,Henkel AG & Co.

I. The appeal filed by the opponent (hereinafter the appellant) concerns the interim decision of the opposition division which established that auxiliary request 3 met the requirements set out in the EPC.

II. Auxiliary request 3 included 17 claims, with claim 1 being worded as follows:

""Process for the synthesis of the compound of formula (I):

D12|Org. Chem. Res. Dev. 2006, 10(1), 149-152         |

IV. In its decision, the opposition division reached, among other conclusions, the following findings:

- The subject matter of claims 1-17 according to auxiliary request 3 involved an inventive step when considering D1 as the closest prior art.

- The subject matter of claim 1 according to auxiliary request 3 fulfilled the criteria of sufficiency of disclosure of the invention.

V. The appellant, in its statement of grounds of appeal, contested the decision of the opposition division regarding the inventive step of the subject matter of claims 1 to 17 according to auxiliary request 3, and the sufficiency of disclosure of the underlying invention. It submitted the following documents:

VI. The patent holder (hereinafter the respondent), in its response to the appeal statement, submitted arguments regarding the inadmissibility of the appeal, the inadmissibility of documents D13 and D14, and the patentability of the claims according to the main request, which corresponded to auxiliary request 3 submitted before the opposition division.

VII. The board summoned the parties to attend oral proceedings scheduled for July 23, 2020. In preparation for this, the board issued a notification under Article 15(1) RPCR dated March 31, 2020. The board indicated its provisional opinion regarding the admissibility of the appeal, inventive step, and sufficiency of disclosure.

VIII. In a letter dated July 1, 2020, the respondent withdrew its request for oral proceedings on the condition that the appellant withdraw its request for oral proceedings. By email on July 3, 2020, the appellant withdrew its request for oral proceedings. The oral proceedings were canceled with the letter of July 8, 2020. The present decision is based on the submissions provided by the parties and the observations made in the board's notification during the written phase.

IX. The following arguments, insofar as they are relevant to the present decision, were put forward by the appellant.

Inventive Step:

- D1 was the closest prior art and described the preparation of the same product and the same intermediates as those of claim 1 of the main request.

- The differences between claim 1 of the main request and the teaching of D1 were that the compounds of formulas (V) and (VI) were not isolated.

- The fact that the amide compound of formula (V) was not isolated could not lead to the technical effect mentioned in the decision, namely the improvement of yield, as the yield after isolation of the corresponding compound 4b was 96% in D1.

- Furthermore, the non-isolation of the compound of formula (V) and the acyl chloride of formula (VI) was part of the general common knowledge of the skilled person, as shown by D8. Since the compounds of formula (VI) were highly reactive, there was a tendency in the art not to isolate them, as evidenced by documents D13 and D14.

- Thus, the non-isolation of the compound of formula (V) and the acyl chloride of formula (VI) was obvious, and the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request did not involve an inventive step.

Sufficiency of Disclosure:

- It was only possible to obtain the compound of formula (I) with a yield above 92% under specific operational conditions, as stated in paragraph [0010] of the patent. The operational conditions were those of the sole example of the patent. Due to the absence of these conditions in claim 1 of the main request, the claimed invention did not solve the technical problem across the entire scope of the claim.

X. The following arguments were put forward by the respondent.

Admissibility of the Appeal:

- The case law of the Boards of Appeal required the appealing party to explain how the first instance decision was incorrect in the appeal statement.

- The appellant did not meet this requirement by reiterating arguments already presented without adequately explaining how the opposition division's decision should be reformed. Such a reference in the appeal statement to previously presented arguments, repeated verbatim, had generally been recognized as insufficient by case law (T 2012/16).

- The appellant focused most of its reasoning on the non-isolation of the compound of formula (V) to refute the claim that it was responsible for the observed technical effect. Thus, the arguments regarding the absence of inventive step already presented in the first instance were again presented and partially repeated verbatim in the statement of grounds of appeal (paragraphs 2.6 to 2.12, 3.1 and 3.2).

- The reasoning developed in points 2 and 3 of the statement of grounds of appeal did not constitute an appropriate response to the reasons indicated by the opposition division in its decision, particularly regarding the consideration of the yield increase in the technical problem solved by auxiliary request 3, and the opposition division's failure to consider document D8 to render the yield increase generated by the use of a one-pot process obvious.

Inventive Step:

- D1 described the same sequence of reaction steps as claim 1 of the main request and could be considered as the closest prior art.

- The differences between claim 1 of the main request and the teaching of D1 lay in the fact that the compounds of formulas (V) and (VI) were not isolated.

- The technical effect of these differences was to allow an increase in the yield of the compound of formula (I) obtained. The objective technical problem was to provide a synthesis process for the compound of formula (I) with improved yield and high purity.

- The solution proposed by claim 1 was not obvious in view of the disclosures of D8 and D12. D8 illustrated an example of one-pot synthesis derived from D12. Nowhere in D12 was there mention of the contribution in terms of yield. Similarly, the solution was not obvious when considering D13 and D14. D13 and D14 did not concern structurally similar compounds to those described in the contested patent and did not focus on the yields of the reactions.

Sufficiency of Disclosure:

- The submissions of the appellant on this matter constituted rather an objection of lack of inventive step. The reagents necessary for carrying out each step of the synthesis process were present in claim 1 of the main request, and the skilled person possessed, upon reading claim 1, all the elements to implement the process of the said claim.

XI. Requests of the parties, relevant to the present decision.

The appellant requests the annulment of the decision of the opposition division and the revocation of the patent in its entirety.

The respondent requests:

- that the appeal be rejected as inadmissible,

- the confirmation of the decision of the opposition division and the maintenance of the patent in its modified form according to said decision (main request), and

- that documents D13 and D14 not be admitted into the proceedings.","Reasons for the decision

1. This decision is issued without oral proceedings, the applicant, and consequently the respondent as well, having withdrawn their respective requests for oral proceedings (see point VIII above).

2. This decision is based on the main request, which corresponds to the auxiliary request 3 considered by the opposition division in its decision as meeting the requirements set out in the EPC.

3. Admissibility of the appeal

3.1 The respondent submitted that the applicant had not explained in the appeal brief why the first-instance decision was incorrect (X, above).

3.2 To assess the admissibility of the appeal, it is necessary to examine whether the requirements of Article 108, third sentence EPC and Rule 99(2) EPC are met, relying on the content of the statement of grounds of appeal and the contested decision. The statement of grounds of appeal must allow understanding of why the decision is erroneous and on what facts the applicant's arguments are based.

According to the board, as stated in the communication under Article 15(1) RPCR dated March 31, 2020, the appeal is admissible for the following reasons.

The decision of the opposition division provides the reasons why the subject matter of claims 1-17 according to auxiliary request 3 then pending involved an inventive step, considering D1 as the closest prior art and why the underlying invention of claim 1 was sufficiently disclosed. In its statement of grounds of appeal, the applicant identifies the reasons why it believes that the subject matter of claim 1 does not involve an inventive step. It argues that the non-isolation of intermediate V is part of the general knowledge of the skilled person (point 2.7 of the statement) and does not lead to any technical effect (points 2.8 to 2.12 of the statement). Similarly, the applicant argues that it is part of the basic general knowledge of the skilled person not to isolate intermediate VI, which is an acyl chloride due to its reactivity (points 2.14 to 2.17 of the statement). These two features (non-isolation of intermediates V and VI) are the distinguishing features of claim 1 according to auxiliary request 3 identified by the opposition division in its decision (point 4.4), for the reasoning of inventive step.

The applicant also submitted arguments in points 2.14 to 2.17 (regarding the non-isolation of intermediate VI) that were neither in its opposition statement nor in its letter of August 24, 2016, which was in response to the amended claims filed by the applicant on July 22, 2016. It is also possible to understand that the applicant contests the reasons for considering the improved yield as an effect for formulating the objective technical problem, as the non-isolation of compound of formula (V) did not contribute to this effect and as the skilled person would avoid isolating the compound of formula (VI) due to its reactivity. For these reasons, the applicant presented arguments in its appeal brief that establish a causal link, at least implicit, with the reasons invoked in the contested decision. Contrary to the respondent's submissions, these arguments do not therefore merely repeat the arguments presented before the opposition division and represent a situation different from that in decision T 2012/16, point V of the statement of facts and conclusions.

For these reasons, the board concludes that the appeal is admissible.

4. Admissibility of documents D13 and D14

The respondent objected to the admissibility of documents D13 and D14. D13 was submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal. D14 was submitted and not admitted during the oral proceedings before the opposition division. The document was resubmitted with the statement of grounds of appeal.

Documents D13 and D14 are admitted into the proceedings in accordance with Article 12(4) RPCR 2007.

Since this decision is in favor of the respondent, it is not necessary to provide reasons for their admission.

5. Inventive step - Article 56 EPC

5.1 The applicant believes that the claimed subject matter does not involve an inventive step considering D1 as the closest prior art in combination with the basic general knowledge of the skilled person.

5.2 The patent relates to a synthesis process for 7,8-dimethoxy-1,3-dihydro-2H-3-benzazepin-2-one of formula (I).

More specifically, claim 1 (point II above) relates to a synthesis process for the compound of formula (I):

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

comprising the following steps:

a) the acid (3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) acetic of formula (IV):

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

is converted into the compound of formula (VI):

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

b) the compound of formula (VI) is not isolated and is subjected to a condensation reaction with a compound of formula (VII):

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

in the presence of a base in an organic solvent,

to yield the compound of formula (V):

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

c) The compound of formula (V) is not isolated and is subjected to a cyclization reaction in an acidic medium to yield, after isolation, the compound of formula (I).

5.3 Closest prior art

Document D1 (""Scheme III"", page 1497) discloses a synthesis process for 7,8-dimethoxy-1,3-dihydro-2H-3-benzazepin-2-one, which corresponds to the compound of formula (I) of claim 1 according to the main request. The respondent in its response to the statement of grounds of appeal (point 4.1) also considers that D1 represents the closest prior art. In agreement with the parties, the board considers that D1 represents the closest prior art.

In D1, the process (""Scheme III"", page 1497, right column) involves, in a first step ""1."", the chlorination of the acid (3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) acetic 4a (corresponding to the compound of formula (IV) of claim 1 according to the main request) in methylene chloride, implicitly leading to the formation of the acid chloride (corresponding to the compound of formula (VI) of claim 1 according to the main request). In a second step ""2."", the acid chloride (3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) acetic is amidated, in the presence of triethylamine and methylene chloride, using 2,2-dimethoxyethylamine (corresponding to the compound of formula (VII) of claim 1 according to the main request) to yield N-(2,2-dimethoxyethyl)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)acetamide 4b (corresponding to the compound of formula (V) of claim 1 according to the main request). In a final step, compound 4b is cyclized with concentrated hydrochloric acid (corresponding to the cyclization reaction in an acidic medium of claim 1 according to the main request) to give compound 4c (corresponding to the compound of formula (I) of claim 1 according to the main request).

The operational conditions are described on page 1503, left column, compounds ""(4b)"" and ""(4c)"". The acid chloride (3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) acetic, corresponding to the compound of formula (VI) of claim 1 according to the main request, was isolated after distillation (see the synthesis of 4b): ""The mixture was heated under reflux, evaporated, and distilled at 125-130°C (1 Torr) to yield 48.5 g (81%) of the corresponding acid chloride"".

Compound 4b (corresponding to the compound of formula (V) of claim 1 according to the main request) was also isolated: ""After 1 h of stirring at room temperature, the mixture was extracted with water and evaporated in vacuo to yield 60.8g (96%) of 4b"".

Document D1 thus describes, according to claim 1 of the main request, the preparation of a compound of formula (I) involving a first step where a carboxylic acid of formula (IV) is converted into an acyl chloride of formula (VI). This is isolated and then converted into an amide of formula (V) in the presence of an amine of formula (VII). The amide of formula (V) is isolated and then cyclized into the product of formula (I).

5.4 Distinguishing features

Considering the disclosure of D1 (5.3 above), the distinguishing features of claim 1 according to the main request are therefore:

- the compound of formula (VI) is not isolated.

- the compound of formula (V) is not isolated.

These distinguishing features have not been contested by either party.

5.5 Objective technical problem

5.5.1 The effect linked to these distinguishing features is an increase in overall yield. In the patent, the overall yield of the compound of formula (I), from compound (IV), is 92.9% (paragraph [0042] of the patent), whereas it is 58% in D1 (81% x 96% x 75%, see page 1503, left column, compounds 4b and 4c).

Therefore, the objective technical problem is to provide a synthesis process for the compound of formula (I) to improve the yield.

5.5.2 The applicant argued that the non-isolation of the amide compound of formula (V) could not lead to the mentioned technical effect, as the yield after isolation of the corresponding compound 4b was 96% in D1.

The board considers that this argument is not relevant for the following reasons. If it were accepted that this non-isolation of the compound of formula (V) could not be the cause of the overall yield increase observed in the patent compared to the process of D1, it would still be credible that this increase is due to the non-isolation of the compound of formula (VI), which also represents a distinguishing feature of the process of claim 1 of the main request compared to the process of D1. The increase in overall yield must therefore be taken into account in formulating the objective technical problem.

5.5.3 In the context of sufficiency of disclosure, the applicant also submitted that it was only possible to obtain the compound of formula (I) with a yield above 92% under specific operational conditions. Since these conditions were not mentioned in claim 1, the claimed invention did not solve the technical problem across the full scope of the claims.

As explained below (point 6.2), in the absence of verifiable facts, this argument cannot be accepted.

5.6 Non-obviousness of the solution

The board considers that the prior art does not teach to carry out a ""one pot"" preparation to improve the yield of the compound of formula (I), for the following reasons.

""One pot"" syntheses are known, as shown by documents D8 (full document) and D12 (page 150, ""Scheme 3"" and page 151, ""7-hydroxyquinoline (1)""), which represent the basic general knowledge of the skilled person. These describe cyclization reactions in an acidic medium according to a ""one pot"" method. However, these documents describe the preparation of 7-hydroxyquinoline, which is not a compound similar to the compound of formula (I). Furthermore, the preparation involves different reactants and reagents than those used in the patent. It is also noteworthy that D12 does not mention any improvement in yield. Only D8 mentions that the ""one pot"" preparation is a strategy to improve the efficiency of a chemical reaction. D8 also refers to an improvement in yield. However, this does not mean that the skilled person would expect this improvement for any multi-step process considered. D1 teaches the distillation and purification of intermediate compounds (compounds of formulas (VI) and (V) according to claim 1), which constitutes an indication that the intermediates should be isolated. The state of the art does not suggest that comparable (or higher) yields would be obtained if the distillation/purification step were omitted in the preparation of the intermediate compounds of formulas (VI) and (V). In other words, although the ""one pot"" preparation was a known technique, the skilled person could not expect that higher yields would be obtained by proceeding in this manner in the specific process of D1.

5.7 The applicant further argued that the non-isolation of the compound of formula (V) and the acyl chloride of formula (VI) was part of the basic general knowledge of the skilled person, as shown by D8. Since the compounds of formula (VI) were highly reactive, there was a trend in the art not to isolate them, as evidenced by documents D13 and D14.

According to the board, these arguments are based on an ex post facto analysis simply considering the fact that it was known to use ""one-pot"" reactions, without considering the objective technical problem. Even if it is recognized that ""one-pot"" reactions are a recognized technique in the field of organic synthesis, nothing suggested, and it could not be expected in view of the possible presence of intermediate products or side reactions, that a higher yield would be automatically obtained by reproducing the synthesis scheme described in D1 according to a ""one-pot"" synthesis. Similarly, while it may be accepted that the high reactivity of acyl chloride compounds of formula (VI) represents an indication not to isolate them, the cited prior art does not mention any teaching that would establish that the non-isolation of these compounds would lead to a higher yield of the process described in D1. In the absence of such an indication, the skilled person, faced with the problem of improving the yield of the reaction described in D1, would not have chosen a ""one-pot"" synthesis. The applicant has not convincingly established the obviousness of the solution to the objective technical problem.

Likewise, documents D13 and D14, which also represent the general knowledge of the skilled person regarding the synthesis of amides involving the use of intermediate acyl chlorides and the conversion of carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides, refer to the non-isolation of the acyl chloride (D13, last paragraph of page 662 and second paragraph of page 663; D14, page 444, paragraph titled ""Procedure""). However, they contain no indication of the yield improvement that would result from the non-isolation of the acyl chloride intermediate. Thus, even considering documents D13 and D14, the skilled person would not have been able to deduce that implementing a ""one-pot"" reaction in the synthesis of D1 would inevitably lead to an increase in yield.

For these reasons, which have already been communicated to the parties in the communication under Article 15(1) RPCR dated March 31, 2020, the board concludes that the subject matter of claim 1 according to the main request involves an inventive step. Claims 2-16 depend on independent claim 1, and the subject matter of claim 17 includes the process of claim 1. Therefore, the subject matter of these claims also involves an inventive step.

6. Sufficiency of disclosure

6.1 The applicant submitted that it was only possible to obtain the compound of formula (I) with a yield above 92% under specific operational conditions. (IX, above).

6.2 Claim 1 specifies, for the synthesis of the compound of formula (I), the reactants of formulas (IV) and (VII) necessary for the preparation of the intermediate products of formulas (VI) and (V) and the reaction conditions (""base in an organic solvent"") to yield the compound of formula (V) and those (""cyclization reaction in an acidic medium"") leading to the product of formula (I).

Any objection regarding the sufficiency of disclosure of the invention can only succeed if serious reservations can be formulated, supported by verifiable facts. The applicant has not shown by verifiable facts that the application as filed, based on its overall content, including the examples, did not contain all the operational conditions for obtaining the compound of formula (I). In the absence of verifiable facts, the arguments submitted by the applicant do not cast doubt that the invention can be implemented across the full scope of claim 1.

Moreover, the argument regarding the allegation that the claimed invention would not solve the technical problem across the full scope of the claims constitutes rather an argument that would be taken into account in the examination of inventive step (problem-solution approach).

For these reasons, the board concludes that the underlying invention of the subject matter of claim 1 according to the main request meets the requirements of Article 83 EPC.

7. None of the reasons invoked by the applicant oppose the maintenance of the patent as amended according to the main request.","Device, For these reasons, it is decided as follows: 1.

I. The applicant (patent owner) has filed an appeal against the decision to revoke European patent No. 1 634 624.

II. An opposition was filed by the respondent (opponent) seeking the revocation of the patent in its entirety for lack of novelty and inventive step, and for extension of the subject matter of the patent as granted beyond the content of the application as filed (Article 100 a) and c) EPC). Among others, the following documents were cited in the opposition proceedings:

(1) ISP ""X-TEND TM 226: A novel ester with high solubilizing capacity"" ISP Product information, August 2003,

(2) DE-A-198 60 268, and

(4) WO-A-2005/117824.

III. According to the opposition division, the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request then pending lacked novelty over document (4) (Article 54(3) EPC). Example 4 of document (2) constituted the closest prior art to the invention. The results of the comparative tests submitted by the applicant on January 10, 2017 (document (12)) and by the respondent on October 2, 2014, and supplemented on December 21, 2016 (document (9)) were both conducted in vitro and based on reliable and significant SPF measurements. The comparative tests of document (9) showed that there was no improvement in SPF when a composition as defined in claim 1 contained 1% by weight of 2-phenylethyl benzoate, whereas the comparative tests of document (12) demonstrated an improvement in SPF values for higher concentrations. The improvement was therefore not observed across the entire claimed range. The problem to be solved was thus to provide alternative photoprotective compositions. Document (1) indicated that the compound X-Tend 226 (2-phenylethyl benzoate) was an advantageous solvent for photoprotective compositions. Thus, a person skilled in the art, starting from the composition of example 4 of document (2) and wishing to provide alternative compositions, would have considered, in light of document (1), replacing C12-15-alkyl benzoate with 2-phenylethyl benzoate without exercising inventive step. Consequently, the subject matter of the then pending auxiliary request 1 did not involve an inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

It was not demonstrated that a quantity of 6% by weight of 2-phenylethyl benzoate was sufficient by itself to solubilize the 1,3,5-triazine derivatives present in the compositions of the tests of document (12). The opposition division therefore did not admit the auxiliary request 2 filed during the oral proceedings because no evidence was provided to establish that the added feature to claim 1, namely that 2-phenylethyl benzoate was present in a sufficient amount to solubilize by itself the total amount of triazine filter, contributed to the solution of the technical problem posed.

The composition of claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 required the presence of specific additional photoprotective agents.

However, the composition of example 4 of document (2) also included complementary organic photoprotective agents required by claim 1. Therefore, claim 1 of the then pending auxiliary request 3 did not involve an inventive step for the same reasons as those stated for auxiliary request 1.

No argument in favor of the inventive step of claim 1 of the then pending auxiliary request 4 was submitted, and the opposition division dismissed this request for the same reasons as for auxiliary request 1.

IV. The applicant contested the conclusions of the opposition division regarding the lack of inventive step of the subject matter of claim 1 of the then pending auxiliary request 1 before the opposition division. This request became the main request in the appeal proceedings. Five auxiliary requests were also filed.

Due to a German national patent application, namely DE 102004027475 conferring prior national rights, the applicant filed separate restricted sets of claims for Germany.

Claim 1 of the main request for all contracting states except Germany reads as follows:

""1. Photoprotective cosmetic or dermatological composition, characterized in that it comprises,

(i) at least one derivative of 1,3,5-triazine, and

(ii) 2-phenylethyl benzoate of the formula:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

(iii) at least one organic photoprotective agent and/or at least one complementary hydrosoluble, liposoluble, or insoluble mineral photoprotective agent in commonly used cosmetic solvents, the complementary photoprotective agent(s) being present in proportions ranging from 0.01 to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition,

provided that the composition is different from an oil-in-water emulsion comprising

a) 2-phenylethyl benzoate;

b) at least one UV filter of the triazine type;

c) an oil-in-water emulsifier or a mixture of oil-in-water emulsifiers chosen from

- glyceryl stearate citrate,

- a mixture of cetearyl alcohol + hydrogenated castor oil PEG-40 + cetearyl sulfate sodium + glyceryl stearate,

- Polyglyceryl-3-methylglucoside distearate,

- stearic acid,

- PEG-40 stearate,

- PEG-100 stearate or

- potassium cetyl phosphate;

d) other additional UV filters.""

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 differs from claim 1 of the main request in that 2-phenylethyl benzoate is present in a sufficient amount to solubilize by itself the total amount of triazine filter present in the composition.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 differs from claim 1 of the main request in that the composition comprises one or more complementary organic photoprotective agents chosen from anthranilates; salicylic derivatives, camphor derivatives; beta,beta'-diphenylacrylate derivatives; benzotriazole derivatives; benzalmalonate derivatives; benzimidazole derivatives; imidazolines; bis-benzazole derivatives; p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) derivatives; methylene bis-(hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole) derivatives; benzoxazole derivatives; filter polymers and silicone filters; dimers derived from alpha-alkylstyrene; 4,4-diarylbutadienes and their mixtures.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 differs from claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 in that 2-phenylethyl benzoate is present in a sufficient amount to solubilize by itself the total amount of triazine filter present in the composition.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 4 differs from the claim of the main request by the exclusion of the oil-in-water emulsion in which the amounts are by weight relative to the total weight of the composition:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHICFORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 5 differs from claim 1 of auxiliary request 4 in that 2-phenylethyl benzoate is present in a sufficient amount to solubilize by itself the total amount of triazine filter present in the composition.

According to the applicant, document (2) represented the closest prior art to the invention. This document dealt with the stability of derivatives of the 1,3,5-triazine type in cosmetic compositions. The compositions of the invention differed from the prior art compositions containing one or more 1,3,5-triazine type sunscreens by the use of 2-phenylethyl benzoate as the solvent. This solvent stabilized the sunblock compositions and also allowed for a higher sun protection factor than that of prior art compositions comprising derivatives of the 1,3,5-triazine type. The results of the comparative tests submitted with a letter dated November 12, 2015 (documents 10 and 11) showed that the claimed compositions exhibited an excellent sun protection factor. The comparative tests of document (12) conducted based on composition 4 of document (2) demonstrated that the claimed composition showed a significant improvement in sun protection factor in terms of UV-B radiation filtration, which indicated a significant technical effect associated with the presence of 2-phenylethyl benzoate in the claimed composition compared to that described in document (2).

The tests described in document (9) submitted by the respondent exhibited a particularly large standard deviation across the different measurements, suggesting that the implementation of the method used lacked reliability.

The comparative tests described in document (12) exhibited a lower standard deviation and thus allowed for a significant improvement in sun protection factor to be demonstrated.

Therefore, the objective technical problem was to provide a cosmetic composition exhibiting better photoprotective efficacy.

Document (1) was the only document disclosing 2-phenylethyl benzoate. However, it did not disclose any effect of this compound on compositions comprising at least one derivative of the 1,3,5-triazine type, but only taught that 2-phenylethyl benzoate could solubilize oxybenzone and avobenzone.

Thus, a person skilled in the art was not incentivized to use 2-phenylethyl benzoate in the compositions disclosed in document (2) to increase photoprotective efficacy.

Consequently, the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request involved an inventive step in view of the cited prior art.

Auxiliary request 1 corresponded to auxiliary request 2 before the opposition division and included the additional feature that 2-phenylethyl benzoate was present in a sufficient amount to solubilize by itself the total amount of triazine filter present in the composition. This feature limited the subject matter of the invention and contributed to solving the technical problem posed of providing compositions exhibiting an improvement in sun protection factor. In the tests described in document (12), the weight ratio between the amount of 1,3,5-triazine filter and the amount of 2-phenylethyl benzoate was 1, and thus evidently sufficient to allow for the solubilization by itself of the total amount of 1,3,5-triazine filter present in the composition. In contrast, in the tests of document (9), this weight ratio was approximately 5.7. The amount of benzoate was therefore likely insufficient to allow for the solubilization by itself of the total amount of 1,3,5-triazine filter. Thus, the compositions used in the respondent's tests were not according to claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 and were therefore irrelevant.

Auxiliary request 2 corresponded to auxiliary request 2 pending before the opposition division. The compositions implemented in the comparative tests of the respondent (document (9)) did not fall within the scope of the claims. In relation to auxiliary request 2, auxiliary request 3 additionally required that 2-phenylethyl benzoate be present in a sufficient amount to solubilize by itself the total amount of triazine filter present in the composition.

For these auxiliary requests, and also for auxiliary requests 4 and 5, the same reasoning regarding inventive step as for the main request and auxiliary request 1 applied.

V. In its response to the appeal brief, the respondent contested the conclusions of the opposition division regarding the extension of the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 then pending beyond the content of the application as filed and the novelty with respect to the examples of document (4). It also contested the applicant's conclusions regarding the presence of an inventive step.

VI. In the notification dated October 21, 2019, accompanying a summons to oral proceedings set for April 23, 2020, the Board indicated that the feature of claim 1 of the main request according to which the additional photoprotective agent(s) had to be present in proportions ranging from 0.1 to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition did not distinguish the claimed compositions from the compositions of examples 7, 16, 18, and 19 of document (4) in which all protective agents were present in proportions between 0.1 and 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition.

Regarding the comparative test reports of documents (10), (11), and (12) invoked by the applicant to support the presence of inventive step, the Board observed that:

""5. The applicant relies on the comparative tests presented in documents (10) and (11) to conclude that the claimed composition exhibits an excellent sun protection factor. It appears that the tests of documents (10) and (11) do not implement a composition according to the invention.

6. The applicant relies on the test presented in document (12) based on a comparison with composition 4 of document (2) to demonstrate that the claimed composition shows a significant improvement in sun protection against UV-B radiation.

However, the operational protocol indicates that the monochromatic protection factors were recorded between 290nm and 400nm, which covers UV-B radiation, but also UV-A.

7. The applicant concludes from the test presented in document (12) that 2-phenylethyl benzoate allows for a higher protection factor for compositions comprising derivatives of the 1,3,5-triazine type. It seems that the proposed comparison does not allow for such a conclusion, since the compared compositions include other sunscreen agents, notably avobenzone (Parsol 1789). The observed effect may be due to the combination of 2-phenylethyl benzoate with any sunscreen agent(s) present in the composition.

8. According to the applicant, document (1) teaches only that 2-phenylethyl benzoate can solubilize oxybenzone and avobenzone and does not disclose any effect on compositions comprising derivatives of the 1,3,5-triazine type.

However, the applicant's comparative tests implement compositions according to the invention including avobenzone. Document (1) discloses an effect on sun protection resulting from the combination of avobenzone and 2-phenylethyl benzoate.

9. According to the applicant, the feature of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 that 2-phenylethyl benzoate is present in a sufficient amount to solubilize by itself the total amount of triazine-type filters present in the composition excludes the comparative tests of the respondent presented in document (9). In the tests of document (12), on the other hand, the weight ratio of the amount of 1,3,5-triazine filter to the amount of 2-phenylethyl benzoate is 1:1, which allows for the solubilization of the total amount of 1,3,5-triazine filter present in the 2-phenylethyl benzoate.

However, triazine-type derivatives have limited solubility in C12-C15 alkylbenzoates (between 25% and 30%; see document (11)). Although 2-phenylethyl benzoate is a better solvent, it is not evident that the solubility in 2-phenylethyl benzoate of the mixture of triazine-type derivatives present in composition B of document (12) reaches a ratio of 1:1.""

VII. In the response dated February 14, 2020, to the Board's notification, the applicant contested that the compositions of examples 7, 16, 18, and 19 of document (4) affect the novelty of claim 1 of the main request and submitted auxiliary request 6 based on the main request in which these compositions from document (4) were excluded by means of four disclaimers.

The applicant did not provide any comments regarding the Board's remarks concerning the comparative tests presented in documents (10), (11), and (12).

The applicant announced that he would not be represented at the oral proceedings scheduled for April 23, 2020, and withdrew his request for oral proceedings. He requested a decision based on the arguments developed in the written proceedings.

VIII. The Board canceled the oral proceedings of April 23, 2020.

IX. The applicant (patent owner) requested in writing the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent based on the main request, or alternatively on auxiliary requests 1 to 5, attached to the appeal brief dated August 21, 2017, or also based on auxiliary request 6 filed with a letter dated February 14, 2020.

X. The respondent (opponent) requested in writing the rejection of the appeal.","Reasons for the decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

Main request

2. The main request corresponds to the auxiliary request 1 pending before the opposition division. The Board notes that the respondent has contested the opposition division's findings regarding the compliance of this request with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC and regarding novelty in relation to document (4), which is prior art under Article 54(3), thus only relevant for the examination of novelty. However, these points are not decisive since the Board concludes that the subject matter of the claims of this request lacks inventive step.

3. Inventive step

3.1 Closest prior art

The applicant does not contest that document (2) represents the closest prior art to the invention. This document aims to increase the stability of photoprotective cosmetic compositions in the form of water/oil emulsions comprising polar UV filtering substances (page 3, lines 3 to 5). The photoprotective composition of example 4 of document (2) includes, among other components, 2% by weight of dioctylbutamidotriazine and 4% by weight of octyltriazone (solar filters of the type 1,3,5-triazine), as well as 2% by weight of butylmethoxydibenzoylmethane and 2% by weight of methylbenzylidene camphor (organic photoprotective agents) and 6% by weight of C12-15 alkyl benzoate (solvent). The composition of claim 1 differs from that of the document only by the presence of 2-phenylethyl benzoate instead of C12-15 alkyl benzoate.

3.2 Technical problem

The applicant has defined the problem to be solved as providing cosmetic compositions with improved photoprotective efficacy.

3.3 Solution

The solution proposed by the contested patent is the composition of claim 1, characterized in that it contains 2-phenylethyl benzoate.

3.4 Success

3.4.1 The applicant relies on the comparative tests presented in documents (10) and (11) to show that the presence of 2-phenylethyl benzoate in compositions comprising 1,3,5-triazines allows for improved photoprotective efficacy.

In the notification of October 21, 2019, the Board observed that the tests in documents (10) and (11) did not implement a composition according to the invention (see point 5). The applicant did not contest this observation. Consequently, the tests presented in documents (10) and (11) do not allow for the conclusion that the compositions according to the invention have improved photoprotective efficacy.

3.4.2 The applicant also relies on the comparative tests presented in document (12).

In the notification of October 21, 2019, the Board found that the comparison proposed in the comparative tests of document (12) did not lead to the conclusion that the presence of 2-phenylethyl benzoate in photoprotective compositions comprising triazines resulted in a higher protection factor, since the observed effect on SPF could be attributed to the combination of 2-phenylethyl benzoate with another sunscreen agent present in the compared compositions (see point 7).

Since the applicant did not contest this point, the Board has no reason to deviate from its preliminary opinion.

The Board therefore concludes that the tests in document (12) do not show that the presence of 2-phenylethyl benzoate improves the efficacy of photoprotection of compositions comprising 1,3,5-triazine derivatives.

3.4.3 Consequently, all the applicant's arguments supporting the demonstration of improved photoprotective efficacy based on the comparative tests of documents (10), (11), and (12) must be dismissed.

3.5 Reformulation of the technical problem

Since the comparative tests presented by the applicant do not allow for the conclusion that the technical problem of improving photoprotective effect (point 3.2 above) has been effectively solved by the claimed compositions, it is appropriate to reformulate the technical problem to be solved as providing an alternative to the photoprotective compositions of document (2).

3.6 Evidence

It remains to determine whether the solution proposed by the contested patent to the reformulated technical problem is obvious from the prior art, in other words, whether it would have been obvious to a person skilled in the art to use 2-phenylethyl benzoate in photoprotective compositions comprising 1,3,5-triazine derivatives.

The opposition division considered that the proposed solution to the alternative problem was obvious in light of document (1), which taught that 2-phenylethyl benzoate was an advantageous solvent in photoprotective compositions. The applicant did not contest this point, their argument focusing solely on the non-obviousness of the solution to the problem of improvement. Under these circumstances, the Board has no reason to adopt a different position on the analysis of inventive step than that taken in the contested decision and adopts the conclusions of the opposition division that the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request is obvious in light of the combination of document (2) with the teaching of document (1).

3.7 Consequently, the main request must be rejected for lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

Auxiliary request 1

4. According to the applicant, the feature of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 requiring the presence of 2-phenylethyl benzoate in a sufficient amount to solubilize alone the total amount of triazine-type filters present in the composition aims to exclude the comparative tests of the respondent from document (9).

However, the Board did not consider document (9) to reach the conclusion that it had not been shown that the presence of 2-phenylethyl benzoate in compositions containing 1,3,5-triazines improves photoprotective efficacy.

The technical problem to be solved remains, as for the main request, the provision of alternative photoprotective compositions.

Therefore, the subject matter of claim 1 of the auxiliary request lacks inventive step for the same reasons as those invoked for the main request.

Auxiliary requests 2 to 5

5. According to the applicant, the subject matter of claim 1 of these auxiliary requests involves an inventive step for the same reasons as for the main request or auxiliary request 1.

Consequently, since the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request and auxiliary request 1 lacks inventive step, this conclusion also applies to the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary requests 2 to 5.

Auxiliary request 6

6. Claim 1 of auxiliary request 6 differs from claim 1 of the main request only by the exclusion of the compositions of examples 7, 16, 18, and 19 disclosed in document (4) by means of four disclaimers. The filing of this request was motivated solely by the need to restore novelty over document (4), which is prior art under Article 54(3) EPC.

Consequently, the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 6 lacks inventive step for the same reasons as those invoked for the main request.","Device, For these reasons, it is decided as follows: The appeal is rejected.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,Beiersdorf AG,Beiersdorf AG Unnastrasse 48 20253 Hamburg / DE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeal of Opponent 2 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Appellant"") is directed against the decision of the Opposition Division that European Patent No. 1 648 513 (""the Patent"") in its amended form according to the fourth auxiliary request, and the invention to which it pertains, meets the requirements set forth in the EPC. This patent is titled: ""Use of antibodies with optimized ADCC to treat patients with low response to antibody treatment.""

II. The Opposition Division considered in the contested decision that the subject matter of claims 1 and 8 of the main request and of auxiliary requests 1 and 2 extended beyond the content of the application as filed (Article 123(2) EPC). Regarding auxiliary request 3, it decided that the claims met the clarity requirement set out in Article 84 EPC and the requirements of Articles 123(2) and (3) EPC, but that the subject matter of claim 1 was not novel within the meaning of Article 54 EPC. In contrast, it found that the claims of auxiliary request 4 met the requirements of Rule 80, Articles 123(2) and (3), and Article 84 EPC, that the invention to which it pertains was disclosed in a sufficiently clear and complete manner (Article 83 EPC), and that its subject matter was novel and inventive (Articles 54 and 56 EPC).

III. With its notice of appeal, the Appellant submitted, among other things, three new documents (numbered D82 to D84).

IV. The Patent Holder is the Respondent in the appeal proceedings. With its response to the appeal, it submitted, among other things, sets of claims for a main request and 16 auxiliary requests (designated 1, 2A, 2B, 3A to 3D, 4A to 4D, 5A to 5D, and 6) as well as 12 new documents (numbered D85 to D96). The main request is identical to auxiliary request 4, which the Opposition Division had deemed compliant with the requirements of the EPC.

V. Opponent 1, a party of right in the appeal proceedings, did not comment on the content of the response to the appeal nor on the new requests submitted during the appeal proceedings.

VI. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

""1. Use of a chimeric, humanized or human monoclonal antibody of IgG1 isotype anti-Rhesus of human red blood cells, wherein the glycan structure of the Fc domain of the antibody corresponds to a biantennary type, with short chains, low sialylation, mannoses and GlcNAc at the terminal non-intercalating attachment points, and low fucosylation, said composition having a content greater than 80% for the forms G0 + G1 + G0F + G1F and a content for the forms G0F + G1F of less than 30%, for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of hemolytic disease of the newborn in patients homozygous for phenylalanine at position 158 of CD16 (FCGR3A-158F homozygotes) or patients heterozygous valine/phenylalanine at position 158 of CD16 (FCGR3A-158V/F).""

Claim 7 relates to a composition for the same medical use according to Article 54(5) EPC.

Claims 1 and 7 of auxiliary request 1 differ from those of the main request in that the expression ""of the Fc domain of the antibody"" is removed.

Claims 1 and 7 of auxiliary request 2A differ from those of the main request in that the expression ""wherein the glycan structure of the Fc domain of the antibody corresponds to a biantennary type, with short chains, low sialylation, mannoses and GlcNAc at the terminal non-intercalating attachment points, and low fucosylation"" is removed and the expression ""at the level of the glycan structure of the Fc domain of the antibody"" is inserted after ""said composition having.""

Claims 1 and 7 of auxiliary request 2B differ from those of the main request in that the expression ""wherein the glycan structure of the Fc domain of the antibody corresponds to a biantennary type, with short chains, low sialylation, mannoses and GlcNAc at the terminal non-intercalating attachment points, and low fucosylation"" is removed.

The claims of auxiliary request 3A correspond to those of the main request, except that claims 2, 5, 8, and 11 relating to the use, in low responder patients, of antibodies directed against an antigen of a cancer cell with a particular glycosylation are limited by exclusion of anti-GD3 antibodies.

The claims of auxiliary requests 3B to 3D combine this modification with those presented respectively in auxiliary requests 1, 2A, and 2B.

The claims of auxiliary request 4A correspond to those of the main request, except that claims 2 and 5 relating to the use, in low responder patients, of antibodies directed against an antigen of a cancer cell with a particular glycosylation are limited to the case where the antibody is an anti-CD20 antibody and where the cancer is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL-B).

The claims of auxiliary requests 4B to 4D combine this modification with those presented respectively in auxiliary requests 1, 2A, and 2B.

The claims of auxiliary request 5A correspond to those of the main request, except that claims 2 to 5 and 8 to 11 relating to the use, in low responder patients, of antibodies directed against an antigen of a cancer cell with a particular glycosylation have been removed. The claims are thus limited to the use in low responder patients of anti-Rhesus D antibodies with a particular glycosylation in the treatment of hemolytic disease of the newborn.

The claims of auxiliary requests 5B to 5D combine this modification with those presented respectively in auxiliary requests 1, 2A, and 2B.

The claims of auxiliary request 6 correspond to those of the main request, except that the independent claims have been limited by the insertion of the feature that the antibody has ""a cytotoxic activity that is not affected by the FCGR3A-158F homozygotes or FCGR3A-158V/F polymorphism of amino acid 158 of CD16.""

VIII. In accordance with Article 15(1) RPCR, the Board notified its preliminary opinion to the parties. It indicated, among other things, that it considered that the invention referred to in the claims of auxiliary request 2B was sufficiently disclosed and that the subject matter of these claims was novel, but likely lacked inventive activity. The same finding regarding inventive activity was made concerning the other auxiliary requests.

IX. The Board summoned the parties to oral proceedings on March 23, 2021. The Appellant subsequently withdrew its request for oral proceedings. The Respondent and Opponent 1 informed the Board that they would neither be present nor represented at the oral proceedings.

X. The Board therefore cancelled the oral proceedings and informed the parties that the decision would be rendered in writing based on the submissions of the parties currently included in the file.

XI. The arguments of the Appellant can, insofar as they are relevant to the decision, be summarized as follows:

Main Request - Claims 1 and 7

Inventive Activity (Article 56 EPC)

The disclosure of document D3 represents the closest prior art for the subject matter of claims 1 and 7.

The difference between the subject matter of these claims and the disclosure of document D3 lies in the selection of a subgroup of newborn patients suffering from hemolytic disease, namely the subgroup carrying the 158F variant of the FcgammaRIIIA receptor. The effect of this difference is that a subgroup with reduced ADCC activity is treated.

Regarding document D3, the objective technical problem is formulated as follows: ""to provide treatment of hemolytic disease in a subgroup of newborn patients associated with weaker ADCC activity"" (translation provided by the Board; see notice of appeal, page 44).

It would have been obvious to the skilled person to treat the subgroup of patients carrying the 158F variant like all other patients, as this group is large. Approximately 80% of the population carries this variant (see document D5).

Furthermore, nothing in the prior art suggested that this treatment would not be effective for this type of patient.

If the skilled person had considered that the ADCC activity of the antibody was essential for treatment, they would also have expected effective treatment because the antibodies disclosed in document D3 showed superior ADCC activity.

Moreover, they would have found in document D9 the disclosure that antibodies with low fucosylation (like that of D3) showed increased affinity for the 158F variant and consequently increased ADCC activity.

XII. The arguments of the Respondent can, insofar as they are relevant to the present decision, be summarized as follows:

Main Request - Claims 1 and 7

Inventive Activity (Article 56 EPC)

Document D1 is the only document to mention patients with a low responder genotype of the FcgammaRIIIA receptor and to describe antibody compositions having the claimed glycosylation. D1 is considered to be the closest prior art for all claims of the main request.

Document D3 concerns the same therapeutic use as in claims 1 and 7, but it does not mention the claimed subgroup of patients, which is the basis of the invention. It is therefore not the closest prior art.

If document D3 were considered by the Board to be the closest prior art, the subject matter of claim 1 would nevertheless be inventive for the following reasons.

The subject matter of claims 1 and 7 differs from the disclosure of document D3 by the selection of the subgroup of patients with a low responder FcgammaRIIIA genotype (158F/F or 158F/V). This difference allows for the first time an effective clinical treatment of this subgroup of patients, at a level comparable to that of other patients (see figures 2 and 3 of the patent; see diagram on page 93 of the response to the notice of appeal).

The objective technical problem in view of document D3 can be defined as: ""to provide effective treatment with anti-Rhesus antibodies for the subgroup of patients with a low responder FcgammaRIIIA genotype (158F/F or 158F/V), with an effectiveness comparable to that of other patients"" (see response to the appeal, point 4.4.3.1, page 101).

Nothing allowed the skilled person to conclude that the antibodies described in document D3 for the general population would provide effective treatment with anti-Rhesus antibodies for the subgroup of patients with a low responder FcgammaRIIIA genotype (158F/F or 158F/V), with an effectiveness comparable to that of other patients.

None of the other documents in the prior art provided the skilled person with a reasonable expectation of success in providing treatment for the population of low responder FcgammaRIIIA genotype patients (158F/F or 158F/V), who had previously not responded satisfactorily, with an effectiveness comparable to that of high responder FcgammaRIIIA genotype patients (158V/V).

Requests

The Appellant requests the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

The Respondent requests the maintenance of the patent based on the claims of the main request, or alternatively, based on one of the sets of claims of the 16 auxiliary requests, in the hierarchical order indicated in Table 6 of the response to the appeal.","Reasons for the decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

The invention

2. The invention relates to the treatment of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) or the treatment of cancer in a subgroup of patients carrying a low responder genotype of the FcgammaRIIIA receptor (also called CD16A or FCGR3A) (158F/F or 158F/V) with chimeric, humanized, or human monoclonal antibodies of specific glycosylation exhibiting a strong interaction for the FcgammaRIIIA receptor of effector immune system cells (see paragraph [0001] of the patent). ""F"" is the abbreviation for the amino acid phenylalanine according to the one-letter amino acid code and ""V"" is that of the amino acid valine.

3. The activity of an antibody inducing effector cells to lyse target cells is referred to as ""ADCC."" Antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity requires binding of the Fab portion of the antibodies to their target as well as engagement of their Fc domain to the Fc receptors on effector cells (RFc). On ""natural killer"" (NK) cells, the receptor responsible for this cytotoxic activity is FcgammaRIIIA (see paragraph [0004] of the patent). Patients carrying at least one 158F allele of the FcgammaRIIIA receptor respond less well to treatments with conventional monoclonal antibodies, and this difference in response is partly attributed to the lower affinity of their FcgammaRIIIA receptor for IgG-type antibodies (see paragraph [0015] of the patent).

4. The structure and glycosylation composition of an antibody vary, among other factors, depending on the type of cell line used for its production.

Main request - claims 1 and 7

5. Claim 1 concerns a medical use according to decision G 5/83 (Swiss-type claim), namely ""Use of a composition ... for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of hemolytic disease of the newborn in..."". Claim 7 concerns a composition for medical use according to Article 54(5) EPC, namely ""Composition ... for its use in the treatment of hemolytic disease of the newborn in..."". In this case, the board considers these two formulations to be identical for the question of inventive step. Therefore, only claim 1 will be addressed hereafter.

Inventive step (Article 56 EPC)

Closest prior art; difference and effect of this difference

6. Contrary to the respondent's opinion, the board agrees with the appellant that the disclosure of document D3 represents an appropriate starting point for the analysis of the inventive step of the subject matter of claim 1. In any case, if the claimed invention is considered not to involve an inventive step with respect to a particular element of the prior art, the choice of the starting point does not require specific justification since the claimed invention must be inventive with respect to any prior art, subject to the provisions of Article 56, second sentence EPC (see, for example, decision T 967/97; see point 20 below).

7. Document D3 is a patent application filed by the respondent and concerns the treatment of patients with hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN, see page 1, lines 10 to 13; claim 25) with, among others, the anti-Rhesus D antibody R297 (see Table 1, page 12; page 35, lines 23 to 24; page 36, lines 1 to 2; figures 6 and 7) which is identical to the anti-Rhesus D antibody R297 used in the patent (see examples and figure legends, page 9 of the patent). This fact is not disputed by the parties. In the following decision, the analysis of the inventive step is limited to the anti-Rhesus D antibody R297 which constitutes the subject matter of claim 1.

8. The parties also agree that the difference between the subject matter of claim 1 and the disclosure of document D3 is the selection of the subgroup of patients who carry a 158F/F or 158F/V genotype of the FcgammaRIIIA receptor.

9. Regarding the technical effect produced, the respondent considered that this difference allows for an effective clinical treatment of this subgroup of low responder patients, at a level comparable to that of patients who do not carry this genotype. The appellant considered that this difference allows for the treatment of a subgroup of patients associated with a weaker ADCC activity.

10. The antibody T125 expressed in the YB2/0 cell line has an ADCC activity for this subgroup of patients, namely those carrying a 158F/F genotype of the FcgammaRIIIA receptor, which is not significantly different from that of patients with a 158V/V genotype of the FcgammaRIIIA receptor (see figures 2 and 3 of the patent and the diagram on page 93 of the respondent's reply).

In other words, as the respondent noted: ""the ADCC responses via FcgammaRIIIA (CD16A) of patients with the low responder FcgammaRIIIA (CD16A) genotype (158F/F) and high responder (158V/V) obtained with the composition of anti-Rhesus D monoclonal antibody having the claimed glycosylation (T125 YB2/0) are extremely close, showing that there is no longer, with the antibody compositions having the claimed glycosylation, a significant difference in response between the two patient groups (the observed difference is statistically non-significant, with a p-value >0.05 (Student Test))."" (response to the appeal, page 93).

11. The board agrees that the effect noted by the respondent is achieved for the antibody T125 expressed in the YB2/0 cell line (for example, R297). This fact is not contested by the appellant.

Objective technical problem

12. The objective technical problem to be solved by the skilled person is therefore the identification of a group of patients who particularly benefit from the treatment of HDN with the anti-Rhesus D antibody R297 (T125 produced in YB2/0 cells).

13. The solution to this problem is the selection of the subgroup of patients homozygous for phenylalanine at position 158 or heterozygous valine/phenylalanine at position 158 of the FcgammaRIIIA (158F/F or 158V/F).

Obviousness

14. In document D3, the subgroup of patients carrying a low responder FcgammaRIIIA genotype (158F/F or 158F/V) is not identified. Nevertheless, nothing in document D3 or in general knowledge would have indicated to the skilled person to exclude from treatment patients with a FcgammaRIIIA-158F/F or FcgammaRIIIA-158V/F genotype, especially since this group constitutes about 80% of the general population (see document D5, page 757, left column, lines 10 to 17).

15. Document D3 teaches that the antibody R297 (T125 expressed in YB2/0 cells) is among the ""ADCC active antibodies FCRgammaRIIIA"" (see page 12, Table 1) and as the respondent noted in their response, see page 65: ""... it was known from D3 that, to be predictive of in vivo efficacy, the ADCC induced by IgG isotype antibodies had to be induced via the FcgammaRIIIA receptor ..."".

16. Finally, document D3 emphasizes the importance of a reduced fucose content by stating that ""a composition according to the invention particularly effective comprises for example a content greater than 60%, preferably greater than 80% for the G0 + G1 + G0F + G1F forms, it being understood that the G0F + G1F forms are less than 50%, preferably less than 30%"" (page 11, lines 18 to 21). The anti-Rhesus D antibody R297 analyzed for its glycosylation in D3 (see figure 7) possesses all these characteristics.

17. To choose a group that particularly benefits from treatment with an optimized antibody as described in document D3, namely the low fucosylated anti-Rhesus D antibody R297, the skilled person would have consulted document D9 which teaches that antibodies with low fucosylation show a stronger interaction with the 158F variant of FcgammaRIIIA and induce a more pronounced ADCC in patients carrying the 158F allele (see D9, page 10, last paragraph):

""[...] the glycoprotein in the composition comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure which lacks fucose, attached to the Fc region of the glycoprotein. Such compositions were demonstrated herein to exhibit a surprising 100-fold improvement in binding to FcgammaRIIIA(F158), which is not as effective as FcgammaRIIIA(V158) in interacting with human IgG.""

18. The fact that document D9 does not mention HDN would not have prevented the skilled person from considering it since it is part of general knowledge that the ADCC activity of an antibody is caused by the constant Fc part of the antibody and not by the part providing specificity for a target (Fab). Document D9 refers to a multitude of diseases (see for example page 89, first paragraph).

19. The skilled person would therefore have chosen this subgroup of patients, namely those carrying a FcgammaRIIIA 158F/F or 158F/V genotype, as a group that particularly benefits from increased ADCC activity. In light of the results obtained for antibodies derived from T125 and produced in YB2/0 (for example R297) in document D3, the skilled person would not have doubted that this patient group could be treated with such an antibody.

20. The subject matter of claim 1 of the main request is therefore devoid of inventive step.

Auxiliary requests 1 to 6 (including their versions A to D, if applicable)

Inventive step (Article 56 EPC)

21. The respondent did not explain why or how auxiliary requests 1 to 6 (including their versions A to D, if applicable) submitted with the response to the appeal address the objections regarding inventive step in view of document D3 taken as the closest prior art in combination with document D9.

22. Furthermore, the modifications of each of the claims 1 of these requests compared to claim 1 of the main request do not change the subject matter of these claims in a way that establishes an additional difference with the prior art D3 since the antibody R297 for the treatment of HDN remains a subject of these claims.

23. Therefore, the subject matter of each of the claims 1 of these requests is also devoid of inventive step.

Conclusion

24. Since none of the requests meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC, the patent must be revoked.","Device, For these reasons, it is ruled as follows: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2.

I. Applicants I and II (opponents 2 and 1 respectively) and the patent owner filed an appeal against the interim decision of the opposition division establishing that European patent No. 1 810 663 could be maintained based on claims 1 to 17 of auxiliary request 1 received on August 11, 2016.

By letter dated July 22, 2020, the patent owner withdrew their appeal.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 maintained by the opposition division reads as follows:

""1. Cosmetic composition comprising, in a cosmetically acceptable medium,

- at least one non-ionic fixing polymer of the type poly(vinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate) and

- at least one ester of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid, the ester of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid corresponding to the formula:

R1CO-(OCH2CH2)n0-[OCH2-CH(OR2)-CH2]n1(OCH2CH2)n2-R3 where

R2 corresponds to hydrogen or a group (CH2CH2O)n3COR4, n1 is an integer equal to 0;

n2 represents an integer ranging from 2 to 300;

n3 represents an integer ranging from 1 to 300;

n0 is an integer ranging from 0 to 300.

R3 corresponds to a hydroxyl group or a group R5COO,

R1, R4, R5 independently of one another correspond to an alkyl group of C10 to C30 or an alkylene group of C10 to C30,

the concentration of the ester of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid ranging from 1 to 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.""

II. Applicants I and II had filed opposition statements seeking the revocation of the patent in its entirety for lack of novelty and inventive step (Article 100(a) EPC), based inter alia on the following documents:

(5) GNPD Mintel Database; Database accession number 10243450; Hair Styling Products from Alberto Culver Launched in Canada in December 2005,

(6) GNPD Mintel Database; Database accession number 347431; Rework Hair wax from Alberto Culver Launched in Italy in March 2005,

(7) EP-A-0 919 219,

(9) EP-A-1 043 011, and

(11) EP-A-1 055 407.

III. According to the opposition division, the subject matter of claim 1 of the contested patent lacked novelty, particularly in view of documents (5) and (6).

The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 was novel over documents (5) and (6), due to the concentration of 1 to 10% by weight of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid esters required for the claimed compositions. These documents constituted the closest prior art to the invention. The technical problem to be solved aimed at providing a styling composition with improved hair fixing properties. The first series of tests presented in document (19) filed with a letter dated August 11, 2016, showed that the claimed compositions solved the problem of improving hair fixing. None of the cited documents established a link between the presence of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid esters in the composition and the hair fixing properties. The proposed solution to this problem of improving hair fixing, namely the presence of a concentration between 1 and 10% by weight of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid esters, was therefore not obvious in light of the prior art. The subject matter of the claims of auxiliary request 1 thus involved an inventive step.

IV. According to applicants I and II, document (5) or document (6) represented the closest prior art to the invention. The comparative tests presented in document (19) did not show that the claimed compositions had a superior fixing power compared to the compositions disclosed in documents (5) or (6). The objective problem to be solved was therefore that of providing alternative styling compositions.

Documents (7), (9), and (11) concerned styling compositions. From these documents, it appeared that a content of PEG esters between 1 and 10% by weight was common. Furthermore, the styling compositions of examples 8 to 12 were described as having good hair fixing properties with a content of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid esters between 1 and 10% by weight.

Thus, a person skilled in the art would consider a content between 1 and 10% of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid esters as obvious for the purpose of providing an alternative styling composition and would arrive at the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 without exercising inventive step.

V. According to the respondent (patent owner), each of documents (5) and (6) represented the closest prior art to the invention. These documents did not disclose the concentration of the various ingredients of the compositions. Therefore, in order to reproduce the compositions described in these documents, it was necessary to arbitrarily set the contents of 19 or 30 compounds, respectively. By choosing to compare composition A, corresponding to the composition of example 1 of the patent, with comparative compositions B and C in which the contents of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid ester were respectively equal to 0.7 and 13% by weight, based on the weight of the composition, the respondent had placed themselves in a less favorable position by only varying the content of the polyethylene glycol and fatty acid ester. Thus, compositions A and B, and A and C from the test report of document (19) differed only in the contents of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid ester, which showed that the improvement in fixing was due to this feature.

The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 therefore involved an inventive step.

VI. In the notification dated April 16, 2020, accompanying the summons to oral proceedings scheduled for November 10, 2020, the Board communicated its preliminary conclusions, namely that the comparative tests presented in document (19) did not demonstrate an improvement in the fixing power of the claimed compositions compared to those disclosed in documents (5) and (6). The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 therefore lacked inventive step. Furthermore, the Board indicated that it was inclined not to accept auxiliary requests 2 to 5 in the appeal proceedings as the filing of these requests was not justified.

VII. By a letter dated July 22, 2020, the respondent requested the cancellation of the oral proceedings scheduled for November 10, 2020.

VIII. By a notification dated October 26, the parties were informed that the oral proceedings scheduled for November 10, 2020, were cancelled.

IX. The respondent (patent owner) requested in writing the cancellation of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent as granted or, alternatively, the maintenance of the patent based on auxiliary request 1 filed with a letter dated June 22, 2018 (request maintained by the opposition division), or further, based on one of auxiliary requests 2 to 5 filed with a letter dated February 12, 2019.

Applicants I and II (opponents) requested in writing the cancellation of the decision and the revocation of the patent.","Reasons for the decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

Main request - patent as granted

2. Since the patent owner is not the appellant in the appeal procedure against the interim decision of the opposition division maintaining the patent in a limited form, the request for the rejection of the oppositions and for the maintenance of the patent as granted must be rejected under the principle of prohibition of reformatio in peius, see decision G9/92, OJ EPO, 1994, 875.

Auxiliary request 1

3. Inventive step

3.1 Closest prior art to the invention

Documents (5) and (6) disclose a cosmetic composition marketed for hair fixation, indicating the list of ingredients. The cosmetic composition includes, among others, a poly(vinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate) polymer (VP/VA Copolymer) and a polyethylene glycol and fatty acid ester (PEG-20 Stearate). The amounts of the ingredients in the compositions are not specified.

It is undisputed that these compositions disclosed in documents (5) or (6) represent the closest prior art to the invention.

3.2 Technical problem

According to the respondent, the technical problem to be solved was to provide compositions that improve hair fixation.

3.3 Solution

The solution proposed by the contested patent consists of selecting a content of the polyethylene glycol and fatty acid ester ranging from 1 to 10% by weight of the composition.

3.4 Success

The respondent referred to comparative tests submitted with a letter dated August 11, 2016 (document 19) to show that this problem was solved by the claimed compositions. Applicants I and II argued that these tests did not demonstrate that the choice of a concentration of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid esters between 1 and 10% by weight allowed for an improvement in hair fixation.

3.4.1 On the choice of the compared compositions in document (19)

The compared compositions include 6% by weight of a PVP/VA copolymer, 2% by weight of a PEG-200 glyceryl stearate ester, 5% by weight of glycerol, 0.6% by weight of a polymer of acrylamidopropane sulfonic acid in reverse inversion (Sepigel 305), 10% by weight of ethanol, and 0.1% by weight of PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil.

The compositions (B) and (C) representing the closest prior art to the invention additionally include 0.7% and 13% by weight of PEG-100 stearate ester, respectively, while the composition A according to the invention includes 3%.

However, the composition of document (6) includes PEG-20 stearate ester, and not the PEG-100 stearate ester used in compositions (B) and (C) according to the invention. Therefore, these tests cannot demonstrate that a composition differing from the composition of document (6) only by the choice of a concentration of PEG-20 stearate ester between 1 and 10% shows an improvement in hair fixation properties.

Moreover, the compared compositions (A), (B), and (C) all also include 2% by weight of PEG-200 glyceryl stearate ester, which is a polyethylene glycol and fatty acid ester corresponding to the formula

R1CO-(OCH2CH2)n0-[OCH2-CH(OR2)-CH2]n1-(OCH2CH2)n2-R3

where n1 equals 1. According to the application as filed, the esters for which n1 = 0 or 1 are analogous (see page 4, lines 30 to 32). The effect on the improvement of hair fixation shown in the tests is therefore achieved with compositions having a concentration of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid esters increased by 2% compared to that indicated in document (19). Thus, the compared compositions (B), (A), (C) have a total concentration of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid esters of 2.7%, 5%, and 15% by weight, respectively. Therefore, the comparative composition (B), which represents a composition of the prior art, has a concentration of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid esters equal to 2.7%, which is between 1 and 10% by weight.

The tests presented in document (19) therefore cannot demonstrate that the choice of a concentration of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid esters between 1 and 10% is responsible for an improvement in hair fixation properties.

3.4.2 From the above, the Board concludes that the tests presented in document (19) do not show that the problem of improving hair fixation has been solved.

3.5 Reformulation of the technical problem

The technical problem is therefore to be reformulated as the provision of an alternative composition for hair fixation.

3.6 Evidence

A content of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid esters between 1 and 10% by weight is common for styling compositions (see documents (7), (9), and (11)). The proposed solution to the technical problem of the alternative, namely the presence of 1 to 10% by weight of polyethylene glycol and fatty acid ester, is therefore obvious in light of the prior art.

Furthermore, the respondent did not contest the obviousness of the solution in the case where the problem to be solved was to provide alternative compositions for hair fixation.

3.7 In these circumstances, the Board concludes that the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 does not involve an inventive step.

Auxiliary requests 2 to 5

4. In the notification accompanying the summons to the oral proceedings scheduled for November 10, 2020, the Board indicated that it intended not to admit auxiliary requests 2 to 5 into the appeal proceedings, as the respondent merely indicated the nature and basis of the amendments in the application as filed without stating the reasons why these requests could resolve the objections of the applicants. Furthermore, auxiliary request 3 corresponded to a request that had been withdrawn before the opposition division.

In response to this notification, the applicant requested the cancellation of the oral proceedings.

Therefore, the Board has no reason to deviate from its provisional conclusions presented in the notification that auxiliary requests 2 to 5 are not admissible in the appeal proceedings (Article 13(1) RPBA).","Device, For these reasons, it is ruled as follows: 1.

I. European Patent No. 1 584 329 was granted based on 14 claims.

The wording of independent claim 1 was as follows:

""1. A method for treating hair fibers, without additional application of a composition containing a chemical oxidant, characterized in that it comprises the following steps:

- applying to the hair fibers a reducing composition without ceramide containing at least one reducing agent, the reducing agent(s) being selected from thiols and representing less than 3% by weight of the total weight of the reducing composition if the composition does not contain aminothiols, and less than 5% if the composition contains at least one aminothiol,

- raising the temperature of the hair fibers, using a heating iron, to a temperature between 120°C and 220°C, the temperature increase being carried out before or after any rinsing of the hair fibers.""

II. The patent was opposed on the grounds of Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty and inventive step.

III. By the decision pronounced at the conclusion of the oral proceedings on September 21, 2017, the opposition division decided to revoke the patent. The decision was based on the claims as granted, and on the sets of claims filed as auxiliary requests 1-3 by letter dated July 17, 2017.

IV. The following documents, cited during the opposition and appeal proceedings, remain relevant:

D1: US 2003/0033677 A1

D2: JP 2002-356408 A

D3: Automatic translation of D2

D4: JP 2000-139545 A

D5: Automatic translation of D4

D6: US 5,749,379

D7: Comparative tests

V. In its decision, the opposition division considered that the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request was novel in view of D1, D2/D3, and D4/D5.

Document D2/D3 was the closest prior art and described a method for treating hair fibers comprising applying a reducing composition to the hair, followed by applying heat using a heating iron. The technical feature differentiating the subject matter of claim 1 of the contested patent from the method according to D2/D3 was the concentration of the aminothiol.

The comparative tests D7 demonstrated that maintaining the color of the hair was only achieved for a thiol concentration below 3%, and therefore an effect had not been demonstrated across the entire scope of the claim, particularly in relation to D2/D3, and specifically for acetylcysteine. The problem was thus to provide an alternative method. D2/D3 contemplated reducing agent concentrations of 2 to 11%, rendering the solution obvious. Claim 1 of the main request was not inventive.

The same conclusion applied to auxiliary requests 1-3.

VI. The patent holder (hereinafter the appellant) filed an appeal against the decision of the opposition division. The statement setting out the grounds of appeal dated May 18, 2018 was accompanied by auxiliary requests 1 to 4.

For the purposes of preparing for the oral proceedings, the Board sent a notification, in which it particularly noted that the tests D7 did not allow for a comparison between the technical teaching of D2/D3 and the claimed invention.

VII. By its letter dated November 20, 2019, the appellant filed auxiliary requests 1-5 and provided additional comparative tests in the form of document D8.

The wording of claims 1 of auxiliary requests 1 and 2 was as follows, with the modifications compared to claim 1 of the main request, namely the patent as granted, highlighted:

Auxiliary request 1

""1. A method for treating hair fibers, without additional application of a composition containing a chemical oxidant, characterized in that it comprises the following steps:

- applying to the hair fibers a reducing composition without ceramide containing at least one reducing agent, the reducing agent(s) being selected from thiols and [deleted: representing] being present in a concentration between 0.1% and [deleted: less than] 3% by weight of the total weight of the reducing composition if the composition does not contain aminothiols, and in a concentration between 0.1% and [deleted: less than] 5% if the composition contains at least one aminothiol,

Auxiliary request 2

""1. A method for treating hair fibers, without additional application of a composition containing a chemical oxidant, characterized in that it comprises the following steps:

- raising the temperature of the hair fibers, using a heating iron, to a temperature between 120°C and 220°C, the temperature increase being carried out before or after any rinsing of the hair fibers.""

VIII. The oral proceedings took place on February 20, 2020.

IX. The following arguments were presented by the appellant:

Admission of tests D8

The tests were submitted in response to the Board's notification and several months before the oral proceedings. The tests are technically simple and complement the tests already discussed during the opposition phase.

Main request - Inventive step

D2/D3 was the closest prior art and described a method whose claim 1 differed essentially in the content of the reducing agent selected from thiols. Tests D7 showed an effect of improving the smoothing and control of hair volume using the claimed method, while maintaining the color of dyed hair, compared to a composition containing a higher amount of reducing agent than claimed. Starting from D2/D3, the skilled person was not at all incentivized to use a particular amount of reducing agent, namely less than 5% by weight when the composition contains an aminothiol, or less than 3% by weight when the composition does not contain an aminothiol.

Even if tests D7 were not taken into account, the problem would be to provide another method for treating hair fibers, allowing for the maintenance of the color of dyed hair. D2/D3 did not address the issues of volume control and maintenance of the color of dyed hair. The skilled person was not at all incentivized to choose thiols and to use a particular amount of reducing agent when the composition contained an aminothiol or a non-aminated thiol.

Auxiliary request 1 - Inventive step

The arguments remained the same.

Admission of auxiliary request 2

Auxiliary request 2 corresponded to auxiliary request 3 already present in the proceedings, filed with the statement of appeal. This request was a direct response to the opposition division's decision.

Auxiliary request 2 - Inventive step

Tests D7 demonstrated the existence of an effect, hence the presence of inventive step.

X. The following arguments were presented by the respondent during the oral proceedings:

The respondent had not submitted any requests or arguments in writing and presented their case during the oral proceedings before the Board.

Admission of tests D8

These tests should have been submitted with the statement of appeal in response to the opposition division's decision. The Board had not raised any new facts in its notification that could justify the submission of new tests.

Main request - Inventive step

The closest prior art was D2/D3, and the feature differentiating claim 1 of the main request from the subject matter of D3 was the concentration of the reducing agent. Tests D8 and D7 could not demonstrate an effect, particularly across the entire subject matter of claim 1. The problem became the provision of an alternative method, the solution to which was obvious.

Admission of auxiliary request 2 into the proceedings

Auxiliary request 2 was not discussed in the opposition division's decision and was a new request filed in the appeal phase.

Auxiliary request 2 - Inventive step

D7 provided experimental results for a reducing agent concentration of 5%, whereas the claim was limited to a concentration of 3%. There was no direct comparison with D3, and the problem remained the provision of an alternative method.

XI. Requests

The appellant requested the annulment of the opposition division's decision and the maintenance of the patent as granted and, failing that, its maintenance according to one of auxiliary requests 1 to 5 as filed with the letter dated November 20, 2019.

The respondent requested the dismissal of the appeal and the non-admission of the comparative tests filed with the letter dated November 20, 2019 (document D8) and the non-admission of auxiliary requests 1 to 5 filed on the same day.","Reasons for the decision

1. Admission of comparative tests D8 of November 20, 2019

These tests were submitted late, a few months before the oral proceedings, following a notification from the Board of Appeal.

These tests consist of comparative tests and represent the applicant's response regarding an inventive step, namely the impossibility of extrapolating the results of tests D7 to the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request. This point had already been debated during the opposition proceedings, was mentioned in the decision of the opposition division, and was raised again by the Board in its preliminary opinion.

These tests are technically very simple and directly understandable. Furthermore, their submission occurred within the context of the discussion on inventive step and does not open a new point of discussion.

The respondent did not produce any arguments or requests in the written phase of the appeal proceedings, which should be interactive. Their only communication was limited to confirming their attendance at the proceedings and requesting a translation from French to English.

In particular, the respondent did not respond to the appeal brief, which made the situation unclear and justified the applicant waiting for a preliminary opinion from the Board before submitting new requests, facts, or arguments.

The respondent also did not respond to the subsequent submission of new auxiliary requests and tests D8, despite having sufficient time. They never sought to comment on tests D8 in the written phase of the appeal proceedings, nor did they request to submit counter-tests.

In view of the course of the proceedings, it follows that the Board exercises its discretion and admits tests D8 into the discussions (Article 13 RPBA 2007).

2. Main request - Inventive step

2.1 The invention relates to a method for treating hair fibers.

2.2 The opposition division considered in its decision that document D2/D3 constituted the closest prior art. This choice was not contested by either the applicant or the respondent.

The document generally discloses the treatment of hair fibers using a composition comprising a reducing agent at a concentration of 2 to 11% by weight, with or without an oxidizing agent (see rev. 3 and 4), followed by a heating step between 60-220°C; the reducing agent may be an aminothiol, such as N-acetyl cysteine, thioglycolic acid, a salt of this acid, or also a thioglyceryl ether derivative (see para. [0007] of D3).

D2/D3 particularly discloses in example 1 a treatment of hair fibers to prevent hair damage, by applying a composition comprising 6% by weight of an aminothiol, namely N-acetyl cysteine, followed by a heating step at 140°C or 180°C without applying an oxidizing agent (see para. [0045] and [0047], example 1 of D3).

Thus, example 1 of this document does not specifically disclose the treatment using a composition comprising less than 5% by weight of an aminothiol reducing agent.

2.3 According to the applicant, the effects associated with the difference in concentration of the reducing agent are the modification of the behavior of the hair fiber while limiting its alteration, controlling its volume, while better respecting the color of dyed hair.

2.4 The applicant relies on tests D7 and D8 to demonstrate the effect.

These tests relate respectively to the two alternatives considered by the subject matter of claim 1 depending on whether the method involves an aminothiol-type reducing agent or not, namely:

- ""a reducing agent chosen from thiols and representing less than 3% by weight of the total weight of the reducing composition if the composition does not contain aminothiols"" and

- ""a reducing agent chosen from thiols and representing ... less than 5% if the composition contains at least one aminothiol"".

2.5 Tests D7 compare the effect on hair fibers between a method according to the invention using a composition 2 comprising 2% by weight of ammonium thioglycolate and a comparative method using a composition 1 comprising 5% by weight of ammonium thioglycolate; both methods do not use aminothiols. Therefore, these tests D7 do not allow for comparison with example 1 of D2/D3 and are thus prima facie unusable.

However, the results of tests D7 show better protection of the color of dyed hair for the method according to the invention with a measured DELTAE of 4.35 instead of 14.58 for the comparative method.

2.5.1 Tests D8 present a comparison between a method involving compositions comprising an aminothiol, namely a method involving a comparative composition A comprising 6% by weight of N-acetyl-L-cysteine according to example 1 of D2/D3, and a method according to the invention involving a composition B comprising 4% by weight of N-acetyl-L-cysteine.

Tests D8 show that the method according to the invention used in these tests better protects the color of dyed hair than the comparative method. This is evidenced by the DELTAE measurement for both methods, which shows a significant difference in favor of the method according to the invention, namely a DELTAE of 2.64 for the method according to the invention, compared to a DELTAE of 5.03 for the comparative method.

However, the results of tests D8 are also not exploitable, as the cross results of tests D7 and D8 highlight an absence of effect on the entirety of the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request.

Claim 1 of the main request indeed encompasses a method using a reducing agent in an amount of ""less than 5% if the composition contains at least one aminothiol,"" thus including the use of a thioglycolate reducing agent in an amount close to 5% by weight, around 4.9% by weight for example, combined with a minimal amount of aminothiol-type reducing agent, such as around 0.1% by weight of acetylcysteine; this combined composition of reducing agents is very close to the composition used in the comparative method of D7, namely a composition comprising 5% by weight of thioglycolate. However, it turns out that tests D7 show that a method using 5% by weight of a thioglycolate reducing agent produces a poor result concerning the respect of the color of dyed hair, with a DELTAE of around 14.58, whereas according to D8, a comparative method involving the use of N-acetyl-cysteine at 6% according to D2/D3 achieves a much better DELTAE of 5.03.

It follows from this that the method according to example 1 of D2/D3 involving a composition comprising 6% by weight of an aminothiol produces a better effect than certain alternatives of the method according to the invention involving the use of a reducing agent in an amount of ""less than 5% if the composition contains at least one aminothiol,"" as demonstrated by the cross results of tests D7 and D8.

It is therefore not possible to conclude the existence of a particular technical effect related to the technical difference between the claimed method and the disclosure of D2/D3.

2.6 The problem must be reduced to providing an alternative method.

2.7 D2/D3 suggests a method using a composition comprising a reducing agent concentration between 2 and 11% by weight, or even from 4 to 11% by weight (see D3 paragraph [0008]). In view of the lower concentration limits disclosed, it appears that the solution is obvious.

2.8 It follows that the main request is not inventive (Article 56 EPC).

3. Auxiliary request 1 - Admission into the appeal proceedings

In view of the immediately apparent negative conclusions regarding the lack of inventive step of auxiliary request 1 (see point 4 below), it does not seem necessary to extensively discuss the admission of auxiliary request 1 into the appeal proceedings.

Auxiliary request 1 is admitted into the proceedings (Article 13 RPCR).

4. Auxiliary request 1 - Inventive step

4.1 Claim 1 of this request has been restricted by a lower limit of concentration of the reducing agent of 0.1% by weight, namely ""the reducing agent(s) being chosen from thiols and being present in a concentration of between 0.1% and 3% by weight of the total weight of the reducing composition if the composition does not contain aminothiols, and in a concentration of between 0.1% and 5% if the composition contains at least one aminothiol.""

This modification has no impact on the assessment of inventive step, as it does not constitute an additional difference with the disclosure of D2/D3.

Auxiliary request 1 does not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC.

5. Auxiliary request 2 - Admission into the appeal proceedings

Claim 1 of this request involves the removal of an alternative in the claimed method, namely the alternative involving the use of an aminothiol reducing agent.

This request corresponds to auxiliary request 3 submitted with the appeal brief, thus at the earliest stage of the appeal proceedings. In view of the modifications made to this request, which are likely to facilitate the proceedings, it appears that this request is a direct response to the decision of the opposition division.

Consequently, the Board, in exercising its discretion, admits this request into the proceedings (Article 13 RPCR).

6. Auxiliary request 2 - Inventive step

6.1 The subject matter of claim 1 has been restricted to a method involving only a non-aminothiol reducing agent.

Document D2/D3 remains the closest prior art. However, in view of the amendments made to claim 1 of this request, example 1 of D2/D3, which disclosed a method involving the use of an aminothiol, namely N-acetyl-L-cysteine, is no longer relevant.

D2/D3 also generally discloses the treatment of hair fibers:

- with or without the application of an oxidizing agent (see claims 3 or 4 of D3),

- by applying a composition comprising a reducing agent at a concentration of 2 to 11% by weight, followed by a heating step between 60-220°C,

- by a reducing agent that may be an aminothiol, such as N-acetyl cysteine, or a non-aminothiol thiol such as thioglycolic acid, a salt of this acid, or also a thioglyceryl ether derivative (see para. [0007] of D3).

This document does not specifically disclose the treatment of hair fibers, without the action of an oxidizing agent, and by a composition comprising less than 3% by weight of a non-aminothiol reducing agent. It is indeed necessary to make multiple selections to arrive at the claimed subject matter.

6.2 According to the applicant, the associated effects are the modification of the behavior of the hair fiber while limiting its alteration, controlling its volume, while better respecting the color of dyed hair.

6.3 Tests D7 compare the effect on hair fibers between a method according to the invention using a composition 2 comprising 2% by weight of ammonium thioglycolate and a comparative method using a composition 1 comprising 5% by weight of ammonium thioglycolate. The results show better protection of the color of dyed hair for the method according to the invention with a measured DELTAE of 4.35 instead of 14.58 for the comparative method.

Tests D7 thus show that the mere selection for the claimed method, of a composition having a concentration of non-aminothiol reducing agent, such as ammonium thioglycolate, below 3% by weight, shows an improved effect regarding the respect of the color of dyed hair. In view of the chemical structure of non-aminothiol reducing agents (thiolactic acid and its esters, monothiolactate of glycerol, thioglycolic acid and its esters, thioglyceryl, ...) and their mechanism of action on hair fibers, it is reasonable to conclude that these results are extrapolable to all non-aminothiol reducing agents.

The technical problem of achieving the modification of the behavior of the hair fiber while limiting its alteration, controlling its volume, while better respecting the color of dyed hair is therefore well solved by the claimed method.

6.4 D2/D3 shows no indication or suggestion to select the concentration range of the reducing agent as disclosed between 2 and 11% by weight, at a concentration below 3% by weight. Just by virtue of the selection of this feature, one can consider that the claimed solution is not obvious.

Moreover, there is no incentive or suggestion in D2/D3 not to use an oxidizing agent and/or to select a non-aminothiol reducing agent in a method for treating hair fibers in order to respect the color of dyed hair.

6.5 The solution is therefore not obvious, and the subject matter of claim 1 of this request is inventive.

6.6 Auxiliary request 2 meets the requirements of Article 56 EPC.","Device, For these reasons, it is decided as follows: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2.

I. The applicant (patent owner) has filed an appeal against the decision of the opposition division revoking European patent EP-B-2 590 916.

II. The respondents (opponents 1 to 3) have filed oppositions seeking the revocation of the patent in its entirety for lack of novelty and inventive step (Article 100(a) EPC), for insufficiency of disclosure of the invention (Article 100(b) EPC), and for extension of the subject matter of the patent as granted beyond the content of the application as filed (Article 100(c) EPC).

Among others, the following documents were cited in the opposition proceedings:

E25    ANSI/AHRI STANDARD 700: 2006 Standard for

Specifications for Fluorocarbon Refrigerants;

pages 1-15

According to the opposition division, the grounds for opposition under Articles 100(b) and (c) do not oppose the maintenance of the patent as granted. The subject matter of claims 1 and 3 of the main request is novel with respect to the cited documents. However, the subject matter of the claims of the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 9 lacks inventive step starting from example 3 of document E2 as the closest prior art to the invention.

III. During the oral proceedings held on October 25, 2022, before the Board, the applicant defended the maintenance of the patent based on the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 9 on which the contested decision is based. These requests were re-submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal dated May 24, 2019. According to the applicant, the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 9 involves an inventive step starting from document E2 as the closest prior art to the invention.

Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

""1.  Stable composition (CS) comprising at least x % by weight of 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (99.85 < x < 99.98 %), from 0.02 to 0.15 % by weight of unsaturated compound(s) (Ia) chosen from positional isomers of 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene such as 1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (Z and E isomers), and optionally up to 200 ppm of 3,3,3-trifluoropropyne and/or up to 5 ppm of 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropene (HFO-1225ye) and/or up to 400 ppm of compounds (Ib) chosen from 1,1,1,2 tetrafluoropropane (HFC 254eb), 1,1,1,2,3 pentafluoropropane (HFC-245eb), 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a), 1,1,2-trifluoroethane (HFC-143), 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane, hexafluoropropene, cyclohexafluoropropene, and 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropene (HFO-1225zc).""

The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 differs from that of claim 1 of the main request in that the positional isomer of 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene is E-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 relates to the use of the composition according to claim 1 of the main request as a heat transfer agent in stationary or automotive air conditioning, refrigeration, and heat pumps.

The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 differs from the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 in that the use is implemented with a lubricant.

The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 4 differs from that of claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 in that the lubricant is chosen from polyol esters (POE), polyalkylene glycols (PAG), polyalkylene glycol esters, and polyvinyl ethers (PVE).

The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 5 differs from that of claim 1 of auxiliary request 4 in that the lubricant is chosen from polyalkylene glycols (PAG).

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 6 relates to the use of the composition according to claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 as a heat transfer agent in stationary or automotive air conditioning, refrigeration, and heat pumps.

The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 7 differs from the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 6 in that the use is implemented with a lubricant.

The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 8 differs from that of claim 1 of auxiliary request 7 in that the lubricant is chosen from polyol esters (POE), polyalkylene glycols (PAG), polyalkylene glycol esters, and polyvinyl ethers (PVE).

The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 9 differs from that of claim 1 of auxiliary request 8 in that the lubricant is chosen from polyalkylene glycols (PAG).

IV. The applicant requests the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent based on the main request or one of auxiliary requests 1 to 9, all submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal dated May 24, 2019.

The respondents request the dismissal of the appeal.

V. The Board issued its decision at the end of the oral proceedings.","Reasons for the decision

Main request: patent as granted

Inventive activity

1. Closest prior art

The Board, in agreement with the parties and the opposition division, considers that document E2 represents the closest state of the art to the invention.

This document discloses that compositions comprising 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234yf) can be used as heat transfer fluids, particularly those additionally comprising less than 1% by weight of at least one compound chosen from HFO-1234ze, HFC-254eb, HFC-254fb, HFO-1243zf, HFC-245eb, HFC-245fa, HFC-245cb, HFC-236cb, HFC-236ea, HFC-236fa, HFC-227ea, HFC-227ca, HFO-1225yc, HFO-1225zc, HFO-1225ye, 3,3,3-trifluoropropyne, methane, ethane, propane, HFC-23, HFC-143a, HFC-134, HFC-134a, HFO-1132a, and FC-1216 (page 1, lines 15 to 17; page 1, line 27 to page 2, line 7, page 4, lines 6 and 7).

These compositions can be used as heat transfer agents in stationary or automotive air conditioning, refrigeration, and heat pumps (page 4, lines 16 to 28).

Example 3 of document E2 discloses the preparation of HFO-1234yf by the dehydrofluorination of 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC-245eb). The crude product obtained comprises 96.1% by weight of HFO-1234yf, 0.5% by weight of HFO-1234ze (Z), and 0.1% by weight of HFO-1234ze (E), as well as 2.9% of unreacted HFC-245eb.

2. Technical problem

The applicant defines the technical problem underlying the invention as providing a heat transfer composition based on HFO-1234yf that exhibits high stability with respect to the lubricant, is purer than that disclosed in document E2, and is simple to manufacture.

3. Solution

The proposed solution is the composition of claim 1 of the patent as granted characterized in that it comprises at least 99.85% by weight of HFO-1234yf and at least 0.02% by weight of a positional isomer of 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene, such as HFO-1234ze (Z) or (E).

Furthermore, maximum contents of other compounds are imposed, namely:

at most 200 ppm of 3,3,3-trifluoropropyne,

at most 5 ppm of 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropene (HFO-1225ye),

at most 400 ppm of compounds chosen from HFC 254eb, HFC-245eb, HFC-134a, HFC-143, 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane, hexafluoropropene, cyclohexafluoropropene, and HFO-1225zc.

4. Success

Part of the technical problem to be solved relates to providing a purer composition that is simple to manufacture. In the examples of the contested patent, the composition according to the invention was obtained by taking commercially available high-purity HFO-1234yf and adding the by-products. It has therefore not been shown in the contested patent what constitutes the simplicity of manufacture. Consequently, the simplicity of manufacturing the purer composition is not taken into account in the formulation of the technical problem.

5. Reformulation of the technical problem

The technical problem to be solved can thus be summarized as providing a purified heat transfer composition that exhibits high stability with respect to a lubricant such as polyalkylene glycol (PAG) esters.

The Board is convinced that this reformulated problem is solved by the proposed solution, which is not contested.

6. Evidence

6.1 The only outstanding question is to determine whether the proposed solution to solve the reformulated technical problem is obvious from the state of the art, in other words, whether it was obvious to a person skilled in the art that a composition comprising between 99.85% and 99.98% by weight of HFO-1234yf, and the required or tolerated by-products of claim 1, would be stable in the presence of lubricants, such as polyalkylene glycol esters (PAG), under the conditions used in heat transfer operations, for example refrigeration.

6.2 The preparation method of example 3 of document E2 provides a crude composition that comprises 96.1% by weight of HFO-1234yf, 0.5% by weight of HFO-1234ze (Z), 0.1% by weight of HFO-1234ze (E), as well as 2.9% of HFC-245eb, which is the unreacted starting product.

Document E2 teaches that for the use of HFO-1234yf as a heat transfer fluid, purification of the obtained crude product is necessary so that the total amount of by-products is between 0 and 1% by weight (page 2, lines 6 and 7; page 3, lines 30 to 32).

As highlighted by the applicant, it is generally desirable to obtain a product in the purest form possible in order to benefit from the properties of the product in question and to avoid any disadvantages related to the presence of impurities. It is also generally desirable to limit the purification operations of the product if they are costly and burdensome.

Therefore, a person skilled in the art would routinely purify the crude product obtained in example 3 of document E2 until a satisfactory degree of purity for the intended use is achieved. Document E2 discloses that HFO-1234yf can be separated from other products with differing boiling points by conventional means, for example by distillation (page 20, lines 18 to 27).

Consequently, a person skilled in the art wishing to solve the technical problem defined in paragraph 5 above would arrive at the compositions of claim 1 of the main request without inventive activity.

6.3 According to the applicant, the invention does not reside in a composition of HFO-1234yf having a high degree of purity, but rather in the discovery that HFO-1234yf can contain positional isomers without compromising its stability when in the presence of lubricants for use as a heat transfer fluid, the stability of a heat transfer agent in the presence of a lubricant not being predictable if it contains by-products.

The applicant relies in particular on paragraph 5.11.2.1 on page 4 of document E25, which states that the maximum amount of unsaturated impurities in saturated fluorinated refrigerants should not exceed 40 ppm, to conclude that it was not predictable that a composition of HFO-1234yf comprising more than 200 ppm of positional isomers of HFO-1234yf would have satisfactory stability with respect to lubricants.

Aside from the fact that this argument ignores that determining the degree of purity required for the use of a product is part of the routine tasks performed by a person skilled in the art, this argument is also primarily contradictory to the fact that the composition of claim 1 of the main request may contain up to 1300 ppm of unidentified by-products.

On the other hand, the cited paragraph in document E25 concerns the presence of unsaturated impurities in saturated hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants. This teaching does not necessarily apply to the presence of unsaturated hydrofluorocarbon products in an unsaturated hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant, especially when it comes to simple positional isomers.

This argument of the applicant must therefore be rejected.

6.4 According to the applicant, starting from the composition of example 3 of document E2, a person skilled in the art would not arrive at the composition of claim 1 of the main request, since the content of HFC-245 requires a reduction from 2.9% to less than 400 ppm, which is a factor of about 72, while the content of HFO-1234ze (Z and E) must remain above 200 ppm, which requires a lower reduction factor.

However, these considerations are not relevant, as the ease of separation of by-products is not transferable from one product to another since it depends in particular on the physical properties of the products to be separated, such as boiling point or the ability to potentially form an azeotrope. The removal of by-products during distillation is therefore not proportional to the starting amount of each product.

This argument of the applicant must therefore also be rejected.

6.5 According to the applicant, it is not obvious that the claimed composition, which also requires maximum contents of other products, can be obtained by distillation operations starting from the composition of example 3 of document E2. On the other hand, the specifications required for the composition of claim 1 of the patent as granted are not arbitrary, but result from a compromise between the need for purification of HFO-1234yf and the stability requirements in the presence of lubricants, the toxicity of by-products, and their impact on global warming.

However, aside from the fact that seeking a compromise generally falls within the skills of a person skilled in the art, the applicant has not shown that the concentration thresholds of the by-products indicated in claim 1 of the main request were critical to achieving this compromise. Furthermore, the claimed composition of HFO-1234yf includes a binary composition with one of its positional isomers, for example HFO-1234zeE. The presence within the indicated limits of fluorinated compounds, such as 3,3,3-trifluoropropyne, HFO-1225ye, HFC-254eb, HFC-245eb, HFC-134a, HFC-143, HFO-1225zc, cannot contribute to the inventive activity of the claimed composition since this presence is merely optional.

6.6 The Board thus concludes that a person skilled in the art, in light of the state of the art, would arrive at a binary composition comprising between 99.85% and 99.98% by weight of HFO-1234yf and between 0.02% and 0.15% by weight of one of its positional isomers such as HFO-1234zeE, for use as a heat transfer fluid with satisfactory stability in the presence of lubricant routinely, and thus, without demonstrating inventive activity.

It follows that the subject matter of claim 1 of the main request does not involve inventive activity.

Auxiliary request 1

7. In auxiliary request 1, the positional isomers of HFO-1234yf are limited to only HFO-1234zeE.

This limitation does not impact the inventive activity analysis of the main request, since document E2 discloses that this positional isomer is obtained as a by-product in the HFO-1234yf prepared in example 3.

Therefore, the subject matter of auxiliary request 1 also lacks inventive activity.

Auxiliary requests 2 to 9

8. Auxiliary requests 2 to 9 concern the use of a composition according to claim 1 of the main request or auxiliary request 1 as a heat transfer agent in stationary or automotive air conditioning, refrigeration, and heat pumps (auxiliary requests 2 and 6), implemented with a lubricant (auxiliary requests 3 and 7), chosen from (or being) polyalkylene glycol esters (auxiliary requests 4, 5, 8, and 9).

The applicant has argued the presence of inventive activity of the claimed compositions based on their stability when used as a heat transfer agent in stationary or automotive air conditioning, refrigeration, and heat pumps in the presence of a lubricant consisting of polyalkylene glycol esters (PAG). However, the Board does not recognize the presence of inventive activity of the compositions based on this effect during these uses. Therefore, the change from composition claims to use claims of the compositions as heat transfer agents in stationary or automotive air conditioning, refrigeration, and heat pumps in the presence of a lubricant consisting of polyalkylene glycol esters (PAG) does not alter the assessment of inventive activity.

These auxiliary requests must therefore be rejected for lack of inventive activity for the same reasons as those of the main request and auxiliary request 1.","Device, For these reasons, it is ruled as follows, The appeal is rejected.",patent revoked,patent revoked,appeal dismissed,"Mexichem Fluor S.A. de C.V., The Chemours Company FC, LLC, DAIKIN INDUSTRIES, LTD.","Mexichem Fluor S.A. de C.V.

I. European patent no. 1 996 166 (hereinafter referred to as the ""patent"") derives from European patent application no. 07712415.4. The patent was granted with a set of 23 claims.

II. The opposition procedure was based on the grounds for opposition under Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty and inventive step, Article 100(b) EPC for insufficient disclosure of the invention, and Article 100(c) EPC for extension of the claimed subject matter beyond the content of the application as filed.

III. By an interim decision announced at the conclusion of the oral proceedings on November 15, 2018, the opposition division concluded that the patent could be maintained in a modified form (Articles 101(3)(a) and 106(2) EPC) based on the set of claims of auxiliary request 2 submitted during the oral proceedings.

Claim 1 according to this request reads:

""1. Water-insoluble matrix tablets capable of releasing one or more active ingredients in the body in a prolonged manner and comprising at least one active ingredient that can be diverted for drug abuse in the form of granules or microgranules dispersed within a compression matrix, said matrix being composed of a mixture of microcrystalline cellulose and [polyvinyl acetate/polyvinylpyrrolidone (80:20)], characterized in that:

- said active ingredient represents 10 to 50% by weight of the total weight of the tablet,

- said compression matrix represents 50 to 98% by weight of the total weight of said tablet, advantageously 85 to 95%,

- said mixture of microcrystalline cellulose and [polyvinyl acetate/polyvinylpyrrolidone (80:20)] represents 40 to 100%, advantageously 50 to 90% by weight of the total weight of the matrix, and

- the applied compression forces are between 10 kN and 160 kN, and

- said tablets have a crushing strength of at least 4 MPa, advantageously at least 6 MPa, said crushing strength being calculated from the following formula:

where Rd is the diametral rupture of the tablet (in MPa);

F is the hardness of the tablet (in N), said hardness characterizing the rupture force of the tablet during a diametral rupture test of a round tablet placed between two jaws, one fixed and the other movable, and said hardness corresponds to the force applied by the movable jaw that causes the rupture of the tablet into two approximately equal parts;

D is the diameter of the tablet (in mm);

h is the thickness of the tablet (in mm).""

IV. Opponents 1, 2, and 3 (appellants I, II, and III respectively) each filed an appeal against the decision of the opposition division.

V. In her response to the statements setting out the grounds of appeal, the patent holder (the respondent) requested as a main request that the patent be maintained in the form approved by the opposition division. The respondent also submitted three sets of claims as auxiliary requests 1 to 3.

VI. Subsequently, the Board issued a summons to oral proceedings.

VII. In a notification issued under Article 15(1) RPCR, the Board expressed the preliminary opinion that the combination of the ranges of active ingredient and compression matrix content in claim 1 did not appear clearly and unambiguously to the skilled person based on the content of the application as filed, contrary to the provisions of Article 123(2) EPC.

VIII. By letters dated January 21, 2022, and February 7, 2022, appellants III and II requested that the oral proceedings be held in the form of a videoconference.

IX. By letter dated February 4, 2022, the respondent also requested that the oral proceedings be organized in the form of a videoconference.

X. In a notification dated February 9, 2022, the Board informed the parties that the oral proceedings would take place in the form of a videoconference.

XI. An oral proceeding before the Board took place on March 1, 2022, via videoconference in the presence of all parties. During the oral proceedings, the respondent withdrew auxiliary requests 1 to 3 from the appeal proceedings, making the main request the only request before the Board. At the conclusion of the oral proceedings, the chairman of the Board announced the decision.

XII. The main arguments of the appellants regarding Article 123(2) EPC can be summarized as follows:

The respective ranges of active ingredient and compression matrix content in claim 1 were disclosed only separately in different passages of the application as filed. Furthermore, these two features were incompatible with compression matrix contents exceeding 90% by weight of the total weight of the claimed tablets. Due to this incompatibility, it was clear that the combination of these features was not disclosed directly and unambiguously in the application as filed, contrary to the provisions of Article 123(2) EPC.

XIII. The main arguments of the respondent regarding Article 123(2) EPC can be summarized as follows:

The ranges of compression matrix and active ingredient content claimed were disclosed one after the other in the application as filed. The incompatibility reported by the appellants did not render the combination of these two features inconceivable. The skilled person would know how to adjust the contents of the active ingredient and the compression matrix in order to realize the claimed invention.

XIV. Requests

Appellants I, II, and III requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

The respondent requested the maintenance of the patent in the form approved by the opposition division.","Reasons for the decision

1. The appeals are admissible.

Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

2. The subject matter of claim 1

The subject matter of claim 1 relates to matrix tablets characterized in particular by the fact that

a) the active ingredient represents 10 to 50% by weight of the total weight of the tablet (""characteristic (a)""),

and by the fact that

b) the compression matrix represents 50 to 98% by weight of the total weight of said tablet, advantageously 85 to 95% (""characteristic (b)"").

3. Basis of claim 1 in the application as filed

3.1 In this regard, the parties have agreed on the following facts.

a) Characteristics (a) and (b) are mentioned in the respective passages below from the application as filed:

i) page 24, line 29 to page 25, line 1

ii) page 19, lines 5 to 9.

b) Neither of these two passages describes said characteristics in combination.

3.2 Therefore, the question arises as to whether a person skilled in the art reading the application as filed would have been led directly and unambiguously to read these two passages in combination.

3.3 In the Chamber's opinion, the answer to this question must be negative. The reasons are as follows.

3.3.1 In agreement with the respondent, the Chamber considers that the two aforementioned passages (cf. point 3.1 a) above) generally teach characteristics (a) and (b) as preferred embodiments of the invention disclosed in the application as filed.

3.3.2 However, it must be noted that said characteristics are incompatible with compression matrix contents exceeding 90% by weight of the total weight of the claimed tablets. As a result, a person skilled in the art would have regarded characteristics (a) and (b) as belonging to distinct and separate embodiments and would not have been led to consider a combination of them.

3.3.3 The respondent argued during the oral proceedings that this incompatibility did not render the combination of characteristics a) and b) inconceivable. According to her, a person skilled in the art would easily know how to adjust the respective contents of active ingredient and compression matrix so that their sum would not exceed 100% by weight of the total weight of the tablets and that the content of active ingredient would be at least 10% by weight of the total weight of the tablets.

3.3.4 The Chamber has no doubt that a person skilled in the art would be fully capable of selecting the contents of active ingredient and compression matrix in order to realize the invention.

3.3.5 Nevertheless, this is not the criterion that should be adopted to determine whether the combination of characteristics (a) and (b) claimed meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. The relevant criterion for assessing whether an amendment made to what is disclosed in a European patent application or a European patent complies with Article 123(2) EPC is the ""gold standard."" This stipulates that such an amendment can only be made, regardless of its context, within the limits of what a person skilled in the art is objectively able to deduce directly and unequivocally from these documents as filed, based on general knowledge in the relevant field (cf. decision of the Enlarged Board of Appeal G 2/10, point 4.3 of the reasons).

3.3.6 In this case, the amendment in question, namely the combination of characteristics (a) and (b), does not comply with this standard for the reasons stated above.

3.3.7 It follows that the subject matter of claim 1 extends beyond the content of the application as filed, contrary to the provisions of Article 123(2) EPC.

General conclusion

For the above reasons, the Chamber concludes that the ground for opposition under Article 100(c) EPC opposes the maintenance of the patent as amended in the form of the main request.","Device, For these reasons, it is decided as follows, 4.

and where:

- in formula (IIa) and/or in formula (IIb), x = 1; y = z = 0 and R**(6) = methyl, and/or

- in formula (IIIa) and/or in formula (IIIb), x = 1; y = z = 0 and R**(6) = ethyl.""

1.2 Formula (I) of the main request includes a group R**(1). The definition of R**(1) includes, among others, an isoamyl group and an isopentyl group. These two groups refer to the same substituent (3-methylbutyl). Thus, the use of these two groups in the same list leads to a lack of conciseness regarding the definition of R**(1) in claim 1, contrary to the requirements of Article 84 EPC.

The applicant submitted that the use of both isoamyl and isopentyl groups in claim 1 did not contradict Article 84 EPC since these two groups referred to the same alkyl substituent (3-methylbutyl).

The board does not follow the applicant's opinion. Article 84 of the Convention requires that claims must be clear and concise and based on the description. The fact that the definition of R**(1) is clear does not necessarily imply that the claim containing this definition is concise.

1.3 The use of the words ""and where"" in claim 1 makes the definition of formulas (IIa), (IIb), (IIIa), and (IIIb) vague. It is not clear, for example, for a compound of formula (I) for which A is of formula (IIa), (IIb), (IIIa) or (IIIb) whether in these formulas x can only have a value of 1 (according to the condition expressed after the words ""and where"") or can also be an integer greater than 1 (according to the first definition of ""x"" in claim 1 ""x is an integer greater than 0""). The same applies to R**(6), which can only be a methyl group (according to the condition expressed after the words ""and where"") or an alkyl group in C2-C4 (according to the first definition of ""R**(6)"" in claim 1 ""R**(6), identical or different, is an alkyl group in C1-C4"").

1.4 The applicant submitted that the formulas (IIa), (IIb), (IIIa), and (IIIb) in claim 1 of the main request contained only redundant and not contradictory definitions so that the conditions of Article 84 EPC were met.

The board does not share this opinion. As established above, the definitions of ""x"" and the definitions of ""R**(6)"" in claim 1 of the main request are not identical. They are therefore not redundant with respect to each other. Since they do not have the same meaning, there is a contradiction in the claim. At least for this reason, the requirements of Article 84 EPC are not met.

Furthermore, if the definitions were redundant, this would imply a lack of conciseness of the definitions, contrary to the requirements of Article 84 EPC.

1.5 The applicant also submitted that the board's objection had not been raised before the examining division and should not be introduced into the proceedings.

The board disagrees. According to decision G 0010/93 (OJ 1995, 172), the board of appeal has the power to examine whether the patent application and the invention it relates to meet the requirements of the EPC. This also applies to conditions that the examining division did not consider or that it considered to be fulfilled. If the board has reasons to believe that such patentability conditions may not be met, it has the power to introduce them into the proceedings.

2. The board concludes that claim 1 of the main request does not meet the criteria of Article 84 EPC.

3. The main request is not justified.

Auxiliary Request 1: Claims 1 and 2 filed during the oral proceedings

4. Claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 reads as follows:

5. Admissibility of Auxiliary Request 1

Auxiliary request 1 was filed during the oral proceedings before the board.

According to Article 13(2) RPBA 2020 (which applies in this case, see Articles 24 and 25(1) RPBA 2020), this request is, in principle, not taken into account, except in cases of exceptional circumstances, which the concerned party has justified with convincing reasons.

This request corresponds to auxiliary request 4 filed with the letter of November 15, 2022. This latter request was filed based on claims 2 and 3 of the main request in response to the clarity objections raised by the board in its notification under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020 against claim 1 of the main request. To the extent that these clarity objections were raised for the first time in the notification, they represent, according to the board, exceptional circumstances within the meaning of Article 13(2) RPBA 2020.

The board therefore decided that auxiliary request 1 was taken into account under Article 13(2) RPBA 2020.

6. Inventive Step

6.1 The application relates to the use of esteramide-type compounds as solvents in plant protection formulations (page 5, lines 5 to 9 of the application as filed).

6.2 Closest Prior Art

D5 describes the use of branched diamides as solvents in plant protection formulations (see the abstract). The products of examples 1 to 5 of D5 are branched compounds, the alkylene group linking the amide functions being a 1-methylpropyl group.

Thus, D5 has the same objective as that of the application. This document can therefore serve as a starting point for the assessment of inventive step.

D5 was published on June 26, 2008, between the two priority dates of the application (January 25, 2008, and September 18, 2008). The priority document filed on January 25, 2008, is document FR 08/00393. D5 is to be considered as prior art under Article 54(2) EPC that can be taken into account for the assessment of inventive step for the parts of the application that do not benefit from the priority right conferred by the priority document filed on January 25, 2008.

6.3 Priority Right

The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 concerns the use of an esteramide compound chosen from eighteen compounds.

Claim 11 of the priority document FR 08/00393 describes the use of an esteramide compound chosen from fourteen compounds. These fourteen compounds are identical to the first fourteen compounds mentioned in claim 1 of auxiliary request 1.

The use of these first fourteen compounds according to claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 therefore benefits from the priority right of document FR 08/00393 (Article 89 EPC). For the use of these fourteen compounds, document D5 is therefore prior art under Article 54(3) EPC and cannot be taken into account for the assessment of inventive step.

On the other hand, the last four compounds mentioned in claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 are not disclosed directly and unambiguously in claim 11 of document FR 08/00393. This has not been contested by the applicant.

The applicant submitted that these last four compounds were included in formula (I) disclosed in claim 1 of document FR 08/00393. Thus, the use of these last four compounds mentioned in claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 also benefited from the priority right of document FR 08/00393.

The board does not share this opinion. Even if these last four compounds are included in formula (I) described in claim 1 of document FR 08/00393, this formula (I) does not disclose these last four compounds directly and unambiguously as required by the disclosure criteria (see for example decision G 0002/10, OJ 2012, 376, reasons 4.3).

The board concludes that the use of the last four compounds mentioned in claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 does not benefit from the priority right of document FR 08/00393. It follows that document D5 is prior art under Article 54(2) EPC for the use of these last four compounds and can be taken into account for the assessment of inventive step of this subject matter.

6.4 Distinctive Feature

As established above, the products of examples 1 to 5 of D5 are branched diamide compounds. The alkylene group linking the amide functions is a 1-methylpropyl group. This group corresponds to the AMG group of formula -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-, as required by claim 1 of auxiliary request 1.

The distinctive feature of the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 that does not benefit from the priority right of document FR 08/00393 compared to the disclosure of D5 is the presence of an ester function instead of one of the two amide functions of the compounds of examples 1 to 5 of D5.

6.5 Technical Problem

The application does not contain any comparative data showing a particular effect arising from the distinctive feature of claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 compared to D5.

Thus, the objective problem compared to D5 is to provide an alternative solvent for plant protection formulations.

6.6 Evidence of the Solution

The solution proposed by claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 is obvious for the following reasons.

It is evident to the skilled person, seeking an alternative to the solvents of D5, to modify the chemical structure of the compounds described in D5. The skilled person knows that amide and ester functions are functional groups derived from equivalent carboxylic acids. Thus, replacing an amide function with an ester function represents an arbitrary choice of structural modification that falls within the general knowledge of the skilled person.

6.7 The applicant submitted that the choice of the amide function was not obvious given the number of possible structural modifications of the compounds described in D5.

The board does not share the applicant's opinion. In the context of a technical problem that is to provide an alternative, it matters little that there are a large number of possible solutions, since each of the solutions is in itself obvious.

6.8 The applicant also submitted that there were no documents or incentives to replace the amide function of the compounds described in D5 with an ester function.

As explained above, the objective problem is merely to provide an alternative solvent for plant protection formulations. The fact that there is no incentive in D5 or the prior art to choose this functional replacement is not relevant, since, in the context of providing an alternative, the need for an incentive is not a necessary criterion.

6.9 The applicant finally argued that it was not obvious that replacing an amide function with an ester function in the compounds of D5 would render the modified compounds suitable for use as a solvent.

The board does not consider this argument relevant as amide functions and ester functions are functional groups derived from equivalent carboxylic acids and equivalent properties are expected.

6.10 The board concludes that the use of the last four compounds mentioned in claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 as solvents in plant protection compositions does not involve an inventive step from D5 as the closest prior art.

7. Auxiliary request 1 is not justified.

Auxiliary Request 2: Claims 1 and 2 filed during the oral proceedings

8. Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 differs from claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 in that it has been limited to the use of the first fourteen compounds mentioned in claim 1 of auxiliary request 1.

9. Admissibility of Auxiliary Request 2

Like auxiliary request 1, auxiliary request 2 was filed during the oral proceedings before the board.

It was filed in response to the clarity objections and the objection of lack of inventive step with respect to D5 as the closest prior art, raised by the board in its notification under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020. To the extent that these clarity objections and lack of inventive step with respect to D5 were raised in the notification for the first time, they represent, according to the board, exceptional circumstances within the meaning of Article 13(2) RPBA 2020.

The board therefore decided that auxiliary request 2 was admissible under Article 13(2) RPBA 2020.

10. Article 123(2) EPC

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 is based on claim 11 as filed, which describes among other things the fourteen compounds of claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 and the passage on page 1, lines 5-9, disclosing the use of esteramide-type compounds as solvents in plant protection formulations.

Claim 2 is based on claim 14 as filed.

11. Article 84 EPC

In the notification under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020, the board had objected to the clarity of the feature ""use as a solvent"" (point 5.1 of the notification). More specifically, the board indicated that it was not clear what limitation was implied by this feature.

In response, the applicant submitted during the oral proceedings that the feature ""use as a solvent"" was limiting, since this feature excluded the use of the esteramide as an active compound in the plant protection composition.

Thus, the board recognizes that it cannot be excluded that, without this feature, the esteramides cited in claim 1 may be the only (active) constituents of the plant protection formulation. However, the presence of this feature implies that the formulation must include at least two constituents, the solvent and, in addition, an active ingredient. Therefore, it is clear what limitation is implied by the feature ""use as a solvent."" The board thus concludes that the feature ""solvent"" in claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 does not detract from the clarity of the claim.

12. Article 54 EPC

Documents D4 and D5 are the relevant documents cited during the present proceedings.

D4 discloses the use of esteramides among other things as recrystallization solvents for phthalates. The esteramides described in D4 have a linear spacer between the ester and amide functions (succinic, see solvent g. in claim 1). Thus, D4 does not describe esteramides whose spacer between the ester and amide functions is branched as defined in claim 1 of auxiliary request 2. Furthermore, D4, which concerns a use for the recrystallization of phthalates, does not describe the use in plant protection formulations.

As established above, D5 describes diamide compounds used as solvents in plant protection formulations. D5 does not describe esteramide compounds as defined in claim 1 of auxiliary request 2.

13. Article 56 EPC

The priority right based on document FR 08/00393 (point 6.3 above) is valid for the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 2, since it has been limited to the use of the fourteen compounds mentioned in claim 11 of document FR 08/00393. It follows that document D5 is for the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 prior art under Article 54(3) EPC and cannot be taken into account for the assessment of inventive step.

In its notification under Article 15(1) RPBA 2020, the board had objected to the inventive step of the claimed products in the main request (claim 4) considering document D4 as the closest prior art. The set of claims of auxiliary request 2 does not contain product claims. On the contrary, the two claims of auxiliary request 2 are use claims directed to the use of certain esteramides as solvents in a plant protection formulation. D4 deals with the use of esteramides among other things as recrystallization solvents for phthalates. The recrystallization of phthalates is a completely different technical field from a use in the context of plant protection formulations. The board therefore considers that D4 cannot be regarded as a realistic starting point for the assessment of inventive step of the two claims of auxiliary request 2. Even if this document had been given to the skilled person in the technical field related to plant protection formulation, this skilled person would not have arrived at the solution in an obvious manner, since there is no teaching in the prior art to change the spacer described in D4 for use in plant protection formulations. D4 is therefore not relevant for the inventive step of the subject matter as claimed in auxiliary request 2.

The board concludes that the subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 and the subject matter of dependent claim 2 of this request involve an inventive step.","Device, For these reasons, it is decided as follows, 14. The contested decision is annulled., 15.

I. European patent No. 2 249 847 (hereinafter referred to as the ""patent"") derives from European patent application No. 09720028.1. The patent was granted with a set of 43 claims.

II. The opposition procedure was based on the grounds for opposition under Article 100(a) EPC for lack of novelty and inventive step, Article 100(b) EPC for insufficient disclosure of the invention, and Article 100(c) EPC for extension of the claimed subject matter beyond the content of the application as filed.

III. By an interim decision announced at the conclusion of the oral proceedings on March 27, 2019, the opposition division concluded that the patent could be maintained in a modified form (Articles 101(3)(a) and 106(2) EPC) based on the set of claims of auxiliary request 3 submitted during the oral proceedings.

IV. The patent holder and the opponent each filed an appeal against this decision.

V. With her statement setting out the grounds of appeal, the patent holder submitted ten sets of claims as the main request and as auxiliary requests 1, 2, 3, 4, 4a, 5, 5a, 6, and 6a, respectively. She also stated that auxiliary request 7 corresponded to the patent as granted.

The set of claims for auxiliary request 3 is identical to the set of claims of auxiliary request 3 that served as the basis for the contested decision. Claim 1 of this request reads as follows:

""Method for obtaining an extract from Ginkgo biloba leaves substantially free of persistent organic pollutants, said method comprising the following steps:

(a) the Ginkgo biloba leaves are extracted at a temperature of approximately 40 to 100° C with aqueous acetone, an aqueous alcohol of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or anhydrous methanol;

(b) the majority of the organic solvent is separated from the extract to a maximum content of 10% by weight, so that water can be added during the final distillation steps,

(c) the remaining concentrated aqueous solution is diluted with water to a solid content of 5 to 25% by weight, allowed to cool while being stirred to a temperature below 25°C, allowed to stand until a precipitate forms, and the resulting precipitate, consisting of lipophilic components that do not dissolve well in water, is separated,

(d) ammonium sulfate is added to the remaining aqueous solution and the formed solution is extracted with methyl ethyl ketone or a mixture of methyl ethyl ketone and acetone,

(e) the obtained extract is concentrated to a solid content of 50 to 70% and the obtained concentrate is diluted with water and ethanol to obtain a solution containing 50% by weight of water and 50% by weight of ethanol with a solid content of 10% by weight,

(f) an aqueous solution of a lead salt is added to the obtained solution until a color change from brown to amber occurs, and the formed precipitate is separated, or a polyamide is used instead of a lead salt,

(g) the remaining aqueous alcoholic solution is extracted with an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic solvent having a boiling point of 60 to 100° C in order to further separate the alkylphenol compounds,

(h) the remaining aqueous alcoholic solution is concentrated under reduced pressure to a maximum ethanol content of approximately 5% and ammonium sulfate is added to a content of 20% by weight,

(i) the obtained solution is extracted with a mixture of methyl ethyl ketone and ethanol in a ratio of 8/2 to 5/5, preferably 6/4,

(j) the resulting organic phase is concentrated to a solid content of 50 to 70% by weight,

(k) to the obtained concentrate, ethanol is added until an ethanol content of at least 80% is achieved, then cooled to a maximum temperature of 12° C for at least two hours and finally the insolubles are removed by filtration and the filtrate is recovered;

(l) the filtrate is concentrated and dried under reduced pressure at a temperature between 60 to 80° C until a dry extract is obtained with a water content of less than 5%,

characterized in that the said method comprises an additional step of passing one of the organic phases obtained in one of the steps d, i, or k, over an adsorbent consisting of synthetic activated carbon, having a specific surface area of at least 1000 m²/g, with a solvent or mixture of solvents having a polarity between 5 and 6.""

VI. Subsequently, the board issued a summons to oral proceedings.

VII. In a notification issued under Article 15(1) RPCR (hereinafter referred to as ""notification""), the board indicated, as a preliminary opinion, that auxiliary request 3 was to be considered in the appeal proceedings and that the subject matter of claim 1 of this request extended beyond the content of the application as filed, contrary to the provisions of Article 123(2) EPC.

VIII. In response to this notification, the patent holder submitted observations and filed a new set of claims as auxiliary request 7, with the former auxiliary request 7 renumbered as auxiliary request 8.

IX. By letter dated January 11, 2021, received on January 11, 2022, the patent holder withdrew her appeal, thereby losing her status as appellant and becoming the respondent. The patent holder also informed the board that she would not participate in the oral proceedings scheduled for January 27 and 28, 2022.

X. By notification dated January 18, 2022, the parties were informed that the oral proceedings had been canceled.

XI. The opponent submitted essentially the following arguments in writing regarding Article 123(2) EPC for auxiliary request 3:

Claim 1 of this request differed from claim 1 as filed notably by the addition of the feature ""with a solvent or mixture of solvents having a polarity between 5 and 6."" This feature appeared only in example 3b of the application as filed. However, neither example 3b nor example 2, to which example 3b referred, were examples of carrying out the claimed invention. Therefore, the introduction of the aforementioned feature into claim 1 as filed extended the subject matter of the modified patent beyond the content of the application as filed, contrary to the provisions of Article 123(2) EPC.

XII. The patent holder submitted essentially the following arguments in writing regarding Article 123(2) EPC for auxiliary request 3:

The feature ""with a solvent or mixture of solvents having a polarity between 5 and 6"" was derived from example 3b, specifically from page 19, lines 3 to 8 of the application as filed. This example generally described that the step of passing over an adsorbent corresponding to the additional step of claim 1 should be carried out using activated carbon, with a solvent or mixture of solvents having a polarity index between 5 and 6. The fact that the step of passing the organic phase over activated carbon illustrated in this example was not linked to the other steps of the claimed method precisely demonstrated that the features tested in example 3b could be generalized to any extraction method of Ginkgo biloba according to claim 1. Therefore, the opponent's objection raised under Article 123(2) EPC was unfounded.

XIII. Requests

The opponent requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent. Furthermore, she contested the opposition division's decision regarding the admissibility of auxiliary request 3 that was the subject of the contested decision.

The patent holder requested the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent in a modified form based on the main request submitted with her appeal statement, or alternatively based on one of auxiliary requests 1, 2, 3, 4, 4a, 5, 5a, 6, 6a submitted with her appeal statement, or based on auxiliary request 7 submitted with her letter of February 9, 2021, or based on auxiliary request 8 corresponding to the patent as granted.","Reasons for the decision

1. The appeal is admissible.

Main request and auxiliary requests 1, 2, 4, 4a, 5, 5a, 6, 6a, 7, and 8 - prohibition of ""reformatio in peius""

2. The aforementioned requests were filed by the patent holder as the appellant. Subsequently, the patent holder (hereinafter referred to as ""the respondent"") withdrew their appeal, thereby taking the status of a party to the proceedings in accordance with Article 107, second sentence EPC. The opponent therefore remains the sole appellant (hereinafter referred to as ""the appellant"").

3. In such a situation, it is necessary to examine whether the principle of the prohibition of ""reformatio in peius"" (see decisions G 9/92 and G 4/93, OJ EPO, 1994, 875; G 1/99, OJ EPO 2001, 381) applies to the sets of claims of the main request and auxiliary requests 1, 2, 4, 4a, 5, 5a, 6, 6a, 7, and 8. According to this principle, the board does not have the power to examine a modified claim that would place the opponent and sole appellant in a more unfavorable situation than if they had not filed an appeal.

4. In the present case, the opposition division had decided that the patent as modified according to auxiliary request 3 and the invention to which it pertains met the requirements set out in the EPC.

5. The set of claims of this auxiliary request comprises a total of 33 claims, all defining a method for obtaining an extract from Ginkgo biloba leaves.

6. In contrast, the sets of claims of auxiliary requests 1, 2, 4, 4a, 5, 5a, 6, 6a, 7, and 8 further include product claims relating to extracts of Ginkgo biloba characterized by their method of obtaining. The scope of these sets of claims is therefore undeniably broader than that of the set of claims of auxiliary request 3 accepted by the opposition division. Consequently, these sets of claims would worsen the situation of the appellant compared to the contested decision and thus violate the principle of the prohibition of reformatio in peius. Furthermore, the board notes that the respondent has not put forward any arguments justifying an exception to this principle.

7. It follows that the board does not have the competence to examine the main request and auxiliary requests 1, 2, 4, 4a, 5, 5a, 6, 6a, 7, and 8.

Auxiliary request 3

8. Admissibility (Article 12(4) RPCR 2007)

8.1 The board maintains its provisional opinion expressed in point 3.2 of its notification that the opposition division correctly exercised its discretion conferred by Article 114(2) EPC in admitting auxiliary request 3 into the opposition proceedings.

8.2 Therefore, auxiliary request 3 is to be considered in the appeal proceedings.

8.3 Given the outcome of the appeal proceedings, it is not necessary for the board to provide detailed reasoning on the admissibility of this request.

9. Amendments (Article 123(2) EPC)

9.1 Subject matter of claim 1

9.1.1 Claim 1 relates to a method for obtaining an extract from Ginkgo biloba leaves free of persistent organic pollutants (hereinafter referred to as ""POPs""), said method comprising steps (a) to (l) (see point V. above).

9.1.2 Furthermore, this method includes a so-called ""additional"" step consisting of passing

a) one of the organic phases obtained in one of the steps d, i, or k,

b) over an adsorbent consisting of synthetic activated carbon, having a specific surface area of at least 1000 m**(2)/g (hereinafter referred to as ""the adsorbent""),

c) with a solvent or mixture of solvents having a polarity between 5 and 6.

9.1.3 It is established that the organic phases obtained in one of the steps d, i, or k contain, in addition to the extract of Ginkgo biloba, the following solvents or solvent mixtures:

a.1) methyl ethyl ketone or a mixture of methyl ethyl ketone and acetone (see step (d) of the method of claim 1)

a.2) a mixture of methyl ethyl ketone and ethanol in a ratio of 8/2 to 5/5 (see step (i) of the method of claim 1)

a.3) ethanol (see step (k) of the method of claim 1)

9.1.4 Consequently, as stated in point 2.2.7 of the notification, the board agrees with the appellant's observation that the so-called ""additional"" step according to claim 1 consists of passing one of the three organic phases identified in point 9.1.3 above over an adsorbent consisting of synthetic activated carbon and having a specific surface area of at least 1000 m**(2)/g in combination with a solvent or mixture of solvents having a polarity between 5 and 6.

9.2 Basis of claim 1 in the application as filed

9.2.1 It is undisputed that solvents and solvent mixtures having a polarity index between 5 and 6 are mentioned on page 19, lines 3 to 8 of the application as filed.

9.2.2 Nevertheless, this disclosure must be read in the context of example 3b and example 2 to which example 3b refers. According to these two examples, the four solutions subjected to passage over the adsorbent are organic phases consisting of an extract of Ginkgo biloba, POPs, and a solvent or mixture of solvents, namely a mixture of methyl ethyl ketone and ethanol, a mixture of methyl ethyl ketone and acetone, aqueous ethanol, and n-butanol.

9.2.3 In contrast, claim 1 stipulates that not only the organic phases defined in point 9.1.3 above are passed over the adsorbent but also a solvent or mixture of solvents having a polarity between 5 and 6 (see point 9.1.4 above).

9.2.4 Therefore, even if one were to accept the respondent's argument that example 3b provided a general teaching regarding the step of passing over the adsorbent, it remains that this teaching is limited to scenarios where the solutions passed over the adsorbent are the organic phases themselves alone, and not in combination with a solvent or mixture of solvents having a polarity between 5 and 6.

9.2.5 It follows that claim 1 contains added elements compared to the application as filed, contrary to the provisions of Article 123(2) EPC.

General conclusion

10. For the aforementioned reasons, the board concludes that the ground for opposition under Article 100(c) EPC opposes the maintenance of the patent as modified in the form of auxiliary request 3.","Device, For these reasons, it is decided as follows: 1.

I. The appeal is based on the decision of the opposition division that European patent No. 2 804 880, amended based on auxiliary request 3 submitted during the oral proceedings on June 13, 2019, met the requirements of the EPC.

II. Claim 1 of this request was worded as follows:

""1. Water-soluble copolymer consisting of, in mass relative to the total mass of the copolymer:

- 5 to 45% of at least one cationic vinyl monomer having a quaternary ammonium function and whose cationicity derives exclusively from quaternary ammonium function(s);

- 50 to 95% of at least one monomer of formula (I);

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPHIC

wherein:

- R1 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical;

- Z is a divalent group -C(=O)-O-, or -C(=O)-NH-;

- n is an integer from 2 to 200;

- R2 is a hydrogen atom or a carbon radical, saturated or unsaturated, possibly aromatic, linear, branched or cyclic, comprising 1 to 30 carbon atoms, and 0 to 4 heteroatoms chosen from the group consisting of O, N, and S;

- 5 to 25% of at least one distinct non-ionic monomer from the monomer of formula (I);

the copolymer having a cationic charge density of between 0.3 and 2.6 meq/g.""

III. The contested decision was based, among other things, on the following pieces of evidence:

D1: WO 2005/049676 A1

D2: JP 2001-181354 A

D6: Supplementary tests.

IV. According to the reasons for the decision relevant to the present appeal:

a) The test report D6 submitted two months before the oral proceedings was excluded from the proceedings under Article 114(2) EPC.

b) The novelty of the copolymers subject to auxiliary request 3 was acknowledged with respect to both D1 and D2.

c) Regarding inventive step, the closest prior art could only be represented by the teaching of D1.

The problem to be solved as mentioned in the contested patent was to avoid the formation of precipitates resulting from ionic attraction between two oppositely charged compounds in a cosmetic or detergent composition.

However, D1, whose copolymers according to claim 1 could have a cationicity greater than 2.6 meq/g, did not describe this parameter. Even if the copolymers of the examples in D1 had a cationicity according to the contested patent and led to stable compositions, D1 did not suggest that cationicity was essential for obtaining stable compositions.

Furthermore, considering the preferences expressed in D1 for optional monomers, the most obvious teaching for a person skilled in the art would have been to add anionic charges to the copolymer, which would have led them to copolymers outside the scope of claim 1 in dispute, especially since, according to their expectations, compounds bearing charges of the same sign repel each other.

Thus, the subject matter of auxiliary request 3 demonstrated inventive step.

d) The patent could therefore be maintained based on auxiliary request 3.

V. An appeal against this decision was filed by the opponent (appellant). A response to the appellant's appeal brief was submitted by the patent holder (respondent).

VI. For the preparation of the oral proceedings, the citation of which was notified to the parties in June 2022, the Board sent a notification dated February 9, 2023, in which it provided a preliminary analysis of the disputed points.

VII. By letter dated March 3, 2023, the respondent submitted experimental data and arguments regarding the issue of inventive step in light of this data.

VIII. During the oral proceedings held on March 17, 2023, following deliberation and the Board's statement of opinion that the sole pending request did not involve inventive step, the respondent submitted an auxiliary request referred to hereinafter as ""auxiliary request 1."" Claim 1 of this auxiliary request relates to the use in a cosmetic formulation of a water-soluble copolymer as defined in point II above.

IX. The appellant requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of European patent No. 2 804 880.

X. The respondent requested the dismissal of the appeal (i.e., the maintenance of the patent based on auxiliary request 3 submitted during the oral proceedings on June 13, 2019) and, alternatively, the annulment of the contested decision and the maintenance of the patent based on auxiliary request 1 filed during the oral proceedings before the Board.

XI. The arguments of the appellant relevant to the present decision are indicated below in the reasons for the decision. They are essentially as follows:

a) The arguments put forward by the respondent in their letter dated March 3, 2023, as well as the associated experimental data, should not be admitted into the proceedings.

b) The copolymers according to claim 1 as maintained by the opposition division are anticipated by D1.

c) The copolymers according to claim 1 are also devoid of inventive step in view of copolymer 4 of D1 representing the closest prior art.

d) Auxiliary request 1 should not be admitted into the proceedings.

XII. The arguments of the respondent relevant to the present decision are indicated below in the reasons for the decision. They are essentially as follows:

a) The tests provided by letter dated March 3, 2023, and the submissions related thereto should be admitted into the proceedings.

b) The copolymers according to claim 1 as maintained by the opposition division are not disclosed by D1.

c) They are also inventive, whether or not the tests provided by letter dated March 3, 2023, and the associated submissions are taken into account. Notwithstanding that the choice of copolymer 4 of D1 as the starting point for the analysis of inventive step is based on a posteriori reasoning, an inventive step starting from such a copolymer must be acknowledged.

d) Auxiliary request 1 should be admitted into the proceedings.","Reasons for the Decision

Auxiliary Request 3 submitted during the oral proceedings of June 13, 2019

Novelty with respect to D1

1. The applicant's challenge to the novelty of the copolymers according to claim 1 with respect to D1 is primarily based on claim 1 of the said document concerning a copolymer comprising in the polymerized state:

(A) 60 to 99% by weight of at least one monoethylenically unsaturated polyalkylene oxide monomer of general formula (I) defined in the said claim,

(B) 1 to 40% by weight of at least one quaternized monoethylenically unsaturated nitrogen-containing monomer,

(C) 0 to 39% by weight of a monoethylenically unsaturated anionic monomer, and

(D) 0 to 30% by weight of another monoethylenically unsaturated non-ionic monomer,

the said polymer having a weight average molecular weight Mw of 2000 to 100,000.

As emphasized by the applicant, the monomer (A) can be the methacrylate of methylpolyethylene glycol containing 5 to 30 ethylene glycol units, which is disclosed on page 4, lines 23-25 of this document. According to the said passage, this compound is the particularly preferred monomer (A). It is accepted that this preferred compound of D1 is a monomer of formula (I) according to the present claim 1.

It is also undisputed that the quaternized monoethylenically unsaturated nitrogen-containing monomers (B) considered in D1 (passage from page 4, line 34 to page 6, line 9), and those that are preferred (claim 3 and page 5, lines 1-15), are cationic vinyl monomers possessing a quaternary ammonium function and whose cationicity derives exclusively from quaternary ammonium function(s), i.e., monomers that also meet the definition of the present claim 1.

Furthermore, it is recognized, particularly in view of the definition of the amounts of monomers (A) and (B) in claim 1 of D1, namely 60 to 99% by weight and 1 to 40% by weight, respectively, that the group of copolymers disclosed in D1 largely overlaps with the group of copolymers according to the present claim 1.

1.1 The applicant argues that the definition of an amount of 5 to 25% by weight of at least one non-ionic monomer distinct from the monomer of formula (I) in the present claim 1 cannot justify the novelty of the claimed copolymer, given that D1 discloses in its claim 1 an amount of up to 30% by weight of such a monomer as monomer (D).

Moreover, according to the applicant, the defined cationic charge density in claim 1 could not generate novelty, as this parameter is closely related to the amount of cationic vinyl monomers possessing a quaternary ammonium function, and this amount does not represent a distinguishing feature with respect to D1.

In other words, the novelty of the claimed subject matter could not arise from the mere choice in the teaching of D1 to use 5 to 25% by weight of at least one non-ionic monomer (D). Contrary to the reasoning of the opposition division, it would matter little that the use of an optional monomer in D1 preferentially concerns monomer (C), as the use of (D) is also disclosed therein.

1.2 The respondent does not contest that a copolymer comprising monomers (A), (B), and (D) according to D1 is encompassed by the teaching of claim 1 of this document (response to the appeal brief, page 5, paragraphs 1 to 3). However, it argues that D1 does not disclose copolymers consisting of the said monomers, with monomer (D) being present in an amount between 5 and 25% by weight, the preference in D1 being given to the optional monomer (C) (response to the appeal brief, page 5, paragraph 4 and following). Furthermore, the choice of a cationic charge density range between 0.3 and 2.6 meq/g would, according to the respondent, constitute an additional selection in the teaching of D1 that would be necessary to arrive at the presently claimed subject matter.

2. The Enlarged Board recalled in decision G 2/10 (OJ 2012, 376, point 4.3 of the reasons) the reference standard regarding the notion of disclosure, which has been rooted in the jurisprudence of the boards of appeal since opinion G 3/89 (OJ 1993, 117) and decision G 11/91 (OJ 1993, 125). What is disclosed is what a person skilled in the art is objectively able, as of the date of the relevant document, to deduce directly and unequivocally from the entirety of the document, at least implicitly, based on general knowledge in the relevant field. This standard has been confirmed in decision G 1/16 (OJ 2018, A70, points 17 and 18 of the reasons).

The Enlarged Board further emphasized in decision G 2/10 (point 4.6 of the reasons), citing G 1/03 (OJ 2004, 413, point 2.2.2 of the reasons), the importance of uniformly applying the notion of disclosure for the criteria of Articles 54, 87, and 123 EPC. According to the consistent jurisprudence of the boards of appeal, a document of the prior art therefore destroys the novelty of the claimed subject matter if such subject matter derives directly and unambiguously for a person skilled in the art from a prior art document, including implicitly.

According to the jurisprudence of the boards of appeal, the term ""implicit disclosure"" refers to a disclosure that any person skilled in the art would objectively consider as necessarily arising from the explicit content, i.e., as the direct and unequivocal consequence of what is explicitly mentioned (see jurisprudence of the European Patent Office boards of appeal, 10th edition, I.C.4.3).

A criterion that is not intended to replace the above-mentioned reference standard but serves as a guide for assessing the novelty of the claimed subject matter in cases of overlap with prior art of value ranges or groups of compounds is whether a person skilled in the art would have seriously considered applying the technical teaching of the prior document in the overlapping area; if it can be reasonably assumed that this would be the case, there is a lack of novelty (jurisprudence, supra, I.C.6.3.2 and I.C.6.2.2).

3. Applying the criteria for assessing novelty set out above, it should be noted for the case at hand that D1:

- discloses on page 8, lines 30-31 that copolymers can be obtained by radical polymerization of monomers (A) and (B) and, if desired, (C) and/or (D). This implies that a group of copolymers consisting of the said polymerized monomers, i.e., obtained exclusively by polymerization of monomers (A) and (B) and, if desired, (C) and/or (D) is disclosed,

- directly and unequivocally encourages, through expressed preferences in this same document, the person skilled in the art to use monomers (A) and (B) corresponding to the first two monomers defined in the present claim 1 in amounts also corresponding to what is defined in the contested claim 1 (see point 1 above),

- expresses, taking into account the passages referred to by the respondent, a preference for

(i) copolymers consisting of (A) and (B), of which copolymer 1 (page 11) and copolymer 4 (pages 12 and 13) are examples, and

(ii) copolymers consisting of (A), (B), and (C) (copolymers 2, 3, and 5, pages 11 to 13; page 7, lines 13-17 regarding the minimum preferred amount for monomer (C) and its weight ratio to monomer (A))

- does not indicate any preference, even implicitly, for copolymers consisting of monomers (A), (B), and (D), and

- does not express any preference for the amount of monomer (D), if used.

4. Consequently, although a set of copolymers obtained exclusively by polymerization of monomers (A) and (B) and optionally (C) and/or (D) is implicitly disclosed by D1 and this set conceptually encompasses copolymers consisting of monomers (A), (B), and (D), no passage of this document directing the person skilled in the art towards the use of (D) without (C), especially with a minimum amount of monomer (D) as defined in the present claim 1, in a copolymer consisting of these three monomers has been cited by the applicant. The Board concludes that the applicant has not demonstrated that the claimed subject matter derives directly and unequivocally from the cited prior art.

The objection for lack of novelty raised by the applicant cannot therefore be upheld.

Inventive Step

5. During the oral proceedings before the Board, the applicant, in accordance with its submissions (appeal brief, page 8, lines 4-6), raised an objection based on copolymer 4 of D1 as the closest prior art, whereas the respondent considered that such an objection using this copolymer as a starting point for the inventive step analysis was an a posteriori approach.

Closest Prior Art

6. According to the jurisprudence of the Boards of Appeal of the EPO, the closest prior art is normally an object designed for the same purpose or aiming to achieve the same objectives as the claimed invention and having essentially similar technical characteristics, i.e., which requires few structural modifications (jurisprudence, supra, I.D.3.1). This way of determining the closest prior art aims to realistically place oneself in the situation in which the inventor was deemed to find themselves at the date of the invention, thus avoiding a retrospective and artificial analysis of inventive step in light of the invention, which would be inadmissible.

6.1 According to paragraphs [0013] to [0016] of the contested patent, the present invention aims to provide copolymers that can be used as conditioning agents in cosmetic formulations or as deposition aids in detergents, while addressing the formation of precipitates related to the incompatibility of cationic polymers with anionic species contained in cosmetic formulations or detergents.

6.2 The invention according to D1 concerns cationic polymer additives exhibiting primary (removal of dirt at the end of a washing cycle) and secondary (anti-redeposition and anti-fouling after several washing cycles) detergency that can be easily incorporated into liquid washing formulations (page 2, lines 35-38; page 10, lines 28-34). The additives according to the invention of D1 do not affect the stability and homogeneity of liquid detergents and do not lead, even after prolonged storage, to undesirable phase separation phenomena or precipitate formation (D1, page 10, lines 38-41). Even though the experimental part of D1 does not describe the stability of the tested washing formulations comprising the copolymers exemplified in D1, there is no reason for the person skilled in the art to doubt that this general teaching regarding the stability and homogeneity of liquid detergents comprising the copolymers according to D1, even after prolonged storage, does not apply to the copolymers exemplified in this document.

6.3 The respondent argued during the oral proceedings that the contested invention resided in the compatibility of the claimed copolymers with anionic species, in the absence of other compounds. The invention according to D1, on the other hand, concerned the stability of compositions, namely liquid detergents, comprising these two compounds. The formation of a whitish veil resulting from a lack of compatibility between certain cationic copolymers and anionic species could not be noticed in a liquid detergent. Furthermore, the cationic polymers of D1 would, according to the respondent, solve another problem, namely preventing dirt removed during washing from redepositing on the textile fiber.

It is true that D1 primarily emphasizes the advantages provided by cationic polymers in terms of their use, particularly secondary detergency, as shown in the experimental part of D1, whereas the contested patent more generally mentions their use in the field of cosmetics and detergency, without addressing a specific effect related to the cosmetic or detergency function.

Nevertheless, as indicated in paragraph [0015] of the contested patent and illustrated by its experimental part in paragraphs [0060] and [0061], the ultimate underlying goal of improving the compatibility of cationic polymers and anionic species, as sought in the contested patent, is to avoid the formation of insoluble particles, i.e., a precipitate, which is contraindicated in formulations of the type shampoo, detergent, or softener, i.e., in compositions that do not solely comprise these two ionic species.

Moreover, even if the respondent's argument regarding the formation of a whitish veil is upheld, it should be noted, in accordance with the information provided in paragraph [0015] in the introductory part of the contested patent, that for the person skilled in the art, the formation of a precipitate when using these two ionic species of opposite charges is known to result from the incompatibility of these two ionic species and the coalescence of colloidal particles in suspension, the formation of which is the origin of the whitish veil invoked by the respondent.

6.4 Furthermore, copolymer 4 of D1 is representative of the preferential measures taught in this document, both by the nature of the monomers used and their amount (see point 3 above), such preferences implicitly concerning for the person skilled in the art advantageous measures for achieving the technical objectives mentioned in D1, particularly providing additives that do not affect the stability and homogeneity of liquid detergents and do not lead, even after prolonged storage, to undesirable phase separation phenomena or precipitate formation.

6.5 Under these conditions, the Board concludes that the person skilled in the art wishing to solve the problem posed by the contested patent would be directed towards the teaching of D1, and particularly copolymer 4 of this document, which, in light of the above, cannot be considered an a posteriori approach, contrary to the respondent's claims.

6.6 The respondent suggested that copolymer 3 of D1, having primary and secondary detergency performances superior to those of copolymer 4, would constitute a more promising starting point for the person skilled in the art (response to the appeal brief, page 10, second complete paragraph). Given that the subject of the contested patent does not concern the improvement of detergency properties, this argument cannot be convincing. In any case, D1 does not teach that copolymer 3 of D1 has superior stability properties compared to copolymer 4. In light of the desired stability properties, the person skilled in the art would therefore not have been encouraged to favor copolymer 3 as a starting point for the present invention. It has also not been argued, let alone demonstrated, that any other copolymer disclosed in D1 is structurally closer to the claimed copolymers than copolymer 4 of this document.

6.7 Under these conditions, the Board considers that copolymer 4 of D1 can legitimately be regarded as representing the closest prior art.

Distinguishing Feature

7. In agreement with the parties, the Board notes that the copolymers according to the contested claim 1 are distinguished from copolymer 4 of D1 by the sole additional use of 5 to 25% by weight of at least one non-ionic monomer distinct from the monomer of formula (I). Although the cationic charge density of copolymer 4 of D1 is not expressed in D1, it is undisputed that it has a value of 0.82 meq/g (response to the appeal brief, table at the top of page 6) which falls within the range of values defined in the contested claim 1.

Admissibility of the submissions of the respondent made with the letter of March 3, 2023

8. The respondent submitted by letter of March 3, 2023, experimental data (page 1, second paragraph) complementing the reasoning previously presented, the admissibility of which, as well as that of the arguments related to it, is contested by the applicant. Under Article 13(2) RPCR 2020, the admission of these submissions, which represent a modification of the arguments occurring after the notification of the summons to the oral proceedings, is left to the discretion of the Board, such modification not being taken into account in principle, except in cases of exceptional circumstances, which the concerned party has justified with convincing reasons.

According to the statements of the respondent during the oral proceedings, these tests, requiring the use of a more precise measurement by spectroscopy, would have been conducted not only in urgency due to a change of personnel at the respondent's side but also to respond to the preliminary opinion of the Board.

Their purpose would be to demonstrate that the use of the non-ionic monomer distinct from the monomer of formula (I) in an amount as claimed, i.e., the distinguishing feature with respect to the closest prior art constituted by copolymer 4 of D1, allows for improved and optimized compatibility between the cationic copolymer and the anionic surfactants (page 1, fourth paragraph).

However, the respondent has not shown, nor even indicated, which aspect of the assessment of inventive step starting from copolymer 4 of document D1 as given in the preliminary opinion of the Board would not emerge from the applicant's submissions. This is also not apparent. The arguments presented by the respondent in support of the new tests demonstrate, on the contrary, that such tests and the related arguments could and should have been submitted in response to the appeal brief.

The Board, under the provisions of Article 13(2) RPCR 2020, has therefore decided that the arguments invoked in the respondent's letter of March 3, 2023, and the associated experimental data cannot be taken into account.

Problem Effectively Solved

9. The applicant submits that in the absence of a technical effect related to the distinguishing feature identified in point 7 above, the problem solved by the subject matter of claim 1 with respect to copolymer 4 of D1 is the provision of other cationic copolymers compatible with cosmetic or detergent formulations comprising anionic species.

Aside from an improvement and optimization of the compatibility between the cationic copolymer and the anionic surfactants that the respondent has argued in its submissions in the letter of March 3, 2023, which, however, have not been taken into account, no other formulation of the problem solved by the copolymers in dispute with respect to copolymer 4 of D1 has been proposed by the respondent. Furthermore, apart from the experimental data submitted by letter of March 3, 2023, which have also not been taken into account in the appeal proceedings, the respondent has not provided experimental data relating to a comparison of the stability obtained with copolymer 4 of D1 with that obtained with polymers according to the contested claim, let alone a meaningful comparison demonstrating the existence of a technical advantage resulting from the sole distinguishing feature. As for the respondent's arguments regarding the effect of cationic charge density to solve the problem related to the incompatibility between oppositely charged species (response to the appeal brief, page 2, last paragraph and pages 3 and 4, section II), these are not relevant, as they do not concern the distinguishing feature with respect to the closest prior art (see point 7 above).

Moreover, as indicated in point 6.2 above, D1 teaches that the copolymers of D1 do not affect the stability and homogeneity of liquid detergents and do not lead, even after prolonged storage, to undesirable phase separation phenomena or precipitate formation. The Board, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, therefore accepts that the copolymers according to the contested claim 1, particularly in their overlapping area with the group of copolymers defined in claim 1 of D1, provide, when used in cosmetic or detergent formulations comprising anionic species, a compatibility and thus a stability similar to that obtained with the copolymers of D1.

Under these circumstances, the problem effectively solved by the subject matter of claim 1 is the provision of other cationic copolymers compatible with cosmetic or detergent formulations comprising anionic species.

Evidence of the Solution

10. It remains to determine whether the person skilled in the art wishing to solve the said problem would have found it obvious to modify copolymer 4 of D1 in a manner leading to copolymers according to the contested claim 1.

10.1 It is evident that the person skilled in the art would turn to the teaching of D1 regarding this problem, which also concerns the preparation of cationic copolymers compatible with cosmetic or detergent formulations comprising anionic species (see point 6.2 above). In this regard, D1 teaches a group of copolymers consisting of monomers (A) and (B) and, if desired, (C) and/or (D), (D) being another monoethylenically unsaturated non-ionic monomer present in an amount of up to 30% by weight of the copolymer (see points 1 and 3 above).

Even if this teaching given in claim 1 or in the passage on page 8, lines 30-31 of D1 does not disclose terpolymers consisting of monomers (A), (B), and (D), the person skilled in the art would have clearly identified this family of terpolymers in view of the limited number of combinations between the different types of comonomers (A) to (D) offered by the said teaching.

It follows that the person skilled in the art starting from copolymer 4 consisting of a monomer of type (A) and a type (B) would have found in D1 the suggestion to use as the only additional comonomer another monoethylenically unsaturated non-ionic monomer (D) in a proportion of up to 30% by weight, in order to solve the problem identified in point 9 above. This is particularly the case for the incorporation of low amounts of comonomer of type (D) considering that the implicitly essential comonomers for achieving stability according to D1 are those of types (A) and (B). It is also undisputed that all the monoethylenically unsaturated non-ionic monomers identified in D1 (passage from page 7, line 24 to page 8, line 21) are distinct from the non-ionic monomer (A) of copolymer 4.

10.2 Furthermore, the choice among the amounts of monomer (D) recommended in D1 (up to 30% by weight) of a percentage between 5 to 25% by weight is arbitrary in the sense that it is not linked to achieving a particular effect for the resulting group of copolymers. Such an arbitrary choice among the amounts recommended in D1 cannot be considered inventive. In doing so, the person skilled in the art would also have been led to respect the preferred amounts for the essential constituents of the copolymers of D1, namely monomers (A) and (B), i.e., respectively 65 to 95% by weight and 3 to 30% by weight, thus arriving at copolymers according to the contested claim 1.

The respondent's argument that the person skilled in the art would not have considered the introduction of non-ionic monomer (D), or then in a copolymer also comprising anionic monomer (C), is not convincing, as the problem to be solved does not concern the provision of an additive improving compatibility with cosmetic or detergent formulations comprising anionic species. It is recalled in this regard that the answer to the question of what the person skilled in the art would have done is determined in light of the result they wish to achieve (see decision T 0939/92, OJ EPO 1996, 309, point 2.5.3 of the reasons for the decision). In this case, the person skilled in the art simply seeking to provide other cationic copolymers compatible with cosmetic or detergent formulations comprising anionic species would have considered any suggestion arising from the teaching of D1. They would have particularly, as indicated above, considered copolymers consisting of monomers (A), (B), and (D).

10.3 As for the cationic charge density, it only depends on the weight percentage of monomer (B) in the copolymer and the molecular weight of this monomer, given that the other monomers do not carry a cationic charge (see the appeal brief, page 8, second complete paragraph).

It follows that the obvious substitution of an amount of monomer (A) in copolymer 4 of D1 by a corresponding amount of monomer (D), while maintaining the amount of monomer (B), has no impact on the cationic charge density, which thus remains that of copolymer 4, corresponding to that presently claimed. Furthermore, the substitution of a portion of monomer (B) of copolymer 4 of D1 by an equivalent amount of monomer (D) also results in an unchanged cationic charge density, i.e., compliant with the contested claim 1, if the amount of monomer (B) does not fall below 7% by weight, and considering the previous remark, regardless of the amount of monomer (A) replaced by an equivalent amount of monomer (D). It follows that the vast majority of such obvious substitutions for the person skilled in the art in view of D1 when seeking to solve the problem identified in point 9 above lead to copolymers meeting the definition of the contested claim 1.

10.4 Consequently, the person skilled in the art starting from copolymer 4 of D1 constituting the closest prior art and wishing to solve the problem defined in point 9 above would arrive in an obvious manner at embodiments covered by the contested claim 1.

10.5 It follows that the subject matter of claim 1 does not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC.

Admissibility of Auxiliary Request 1

11. In accordance with the provisions of Articles 13(1) and 13(2) RPCR 2020, the admission of Auxiliary Request 1 submitted during the oral proceedings, following deliberation concerning the sole pending request, is not only subject to the discretion of the Board but also contingent upon the existence of exceptional circumstances that must be convincingly demonstrated by the party submitting this new request.

The respondent invoked in this regard that the preliminary opinion of the Board reached them late and that they would have been surprised that the Board, paying particular attention to structural similarities to determine the closest prior art, did not share the opposition division's position on the issue of inventive step. This would constitute, according to the respondent, exceptional circumstances justifying the admissibility of Auxiliary Request 1.

Such an argument cannot, in the first place, justify the submission of this new request towards the end of the oral proceedings. As indicated in point 8 above, the inventive step objection starting from copolymer 4 of D1 as the closest prior art had been submitted from the outset of the appeal proceedings and the position of the Board expressed in the notification under Article 15(1) RPCR 2020 was based on the applicant's submissions. No new elements in the debate submitted during the oral proceedings were invoked either.

Since the Board's opinion is based on the submissions of one of the parties in an inter partes procedure, the fact that the Board does not follow one party's claims but the position of the opposing party arises from the very nature of this procedure between two parties having opposing views. The respondent should have taken such a possibility into account and the circumstances they invoke cannot therefore be qualified as exceptional.

Furthermore, the restriction made in Auxiliary Request 1, namely the use of copolymers in cosmetic formulations, would require a completely different analysis of inventive step. The choice of one of the copolymers of D1 as the closest prior art would particularly need to be questioned, as this document only concerns liquid detergents. Under these conditions, admitting Auxiliary Request 1 into the proceedings would have required a postponement of the oral proceedings, detrimental to the principle of procedural economy.

In accordance with the provisions of Article 13(2) RPCR 2020 and the discretion granted to the Board by Article 13(1) RPCR 2020, Auxiliary Request 1 is not taken into account.

12. The subject matter of claim 1 as maintained by the opposition division is not inventive and Auxiliary Request 1 is not admitted into the proceedings, the contested patent is to be revoked.","Device, For these reasons, it is ruled as follows: 1.

I. European Patent No. 2 361 605 was granted based on 15 claims. The wording of the independent claims was as follows:

""1. Use for the cosmetic treatment of keratin fibers such as hair, of a cosmetic composition comprising, in a cosmetically acceptable medium:

- from 1.1% to 50% by weight based on the total weight of the composition, of at least two distinct volatile linear alkanes differing from each other by a number of carbon atoms n of at least 1,

- one or more solid fatty alcohols and

- one or more polymeric thickening agents with sugar motifs.""

""15. A method for the cosmetic treatment of keratin materials, preferably keratin fibers such as hair, using a composition as defined in any of claims 1 to 14.""

II. The patent was opposed on the grounds of Article 100(a) EPC for lack of inventive step.

III. The opposition division decided that, based on auxiliary request 2 filed on January 10, 2020, the patent met the requirements of the EPC. This decision was based on the patent as granted (main request) and two auxiliary requests.

IV. The following documents, cited by the opposition division in its decision sent by post on April 3, 2020, remain relevant for the present decision:

D1: DE 10 2008 012 457 A1

D2: Mintel ""Crème de la Curl Shampoo"", ID no. 975726

D3: DE 28 30 093 A1

D5: Test report (N/Ref.: B09-4262EXT EP GD/LM) filed on March 8, 2019

D6: Test report filed on March 6, 2020

V. According to the decision of the opposition division:

a) The subject matter of claims 1 of the main request and auxiliary request 1 did not involve an inventive step.

b) Auxiliary request 2 met the requirements of Articles 123(2), 123(3), and 56 EPC.

VI. The patent holder and the opponent filed appeals against the decision of the opposition division.

VII. In her response to the appeal brief, the appellant - patent holder defended her patent based on a main request corresponding to the patent as granted and 14 auxiliary requests, among which auxiliary requests 1 to 4 had already been submitted in the first instance.

The content of the claims on which the present decision is based can be illustrated as follows:

The wording of claim 1 of the patent as granted (main request) has been stated above.

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 1 differs from that of the main request in that the weight content of the ""at least two distinct volatile linear alkanes"" is ""1.5% to 20% [emphasis added] by weight based on the total weight of the composition.""

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 2 differs from that of the main request in that the weight content of the ""at least two distinct volatile linear alkanes"" is ""2% to 20% [emphasis added] by weight based on the total weight of the composition.""

Claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 differs from that of the main request in that the weight content of the ""at least two distinct volatile linear alkanes"" is ""1.5% to 10% [emphasis added] by weight based on the total weight of the composition.""

VIII. The following pieces of evidence were submitted by the parties during the appeal proceedings:

a) Document submitted by the appellant - opponent on August 4, 2020, with her appeal brief:

D7: Excerpt from ""Rômpp Chemie Lexikon"", 9th edition (1995), volume 3, pages 1681-1683 (Georg Thieme, Stuttgart)

b) Documents submitted by the appellant - patent holder on December 23, 2020, with her response to the appeal brief:

D8: Test report

D9: ""Revised tables for determining significance of differences"", Kramer A, Food Technology, 1963, 17, 124

IX. An oral procedure was held before the board on May 16, 2023, via videoconference.

X. The appellant - patent holder requested the annulment of the contested decision and the rejection of the opposition, i.e., the maintenance of the patent as granted, or, alternatively, the maintenance of the patent based on one of auxiliary requests 1 to 14 presented respectively during the first instance proceedings on January 10, 2020 (auxiliary requests 1 to 4) or with the response to the appeal brief on December 23, 2020 (auxiliary requests 5 to 14). She also requested that document D7 not be admitted into the appeal proceedings.

XI. The appellant - opponent requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

XII. The arguments put forward by the appellant - patent holder, insofar as they are relevant to the present decision, can be summarized as follows:

a) Document D7 had been submitted late and should not be admitted into the appeal proceedings as it should have been submitted during the opposition proceedings.

b) The patent as granted met the criteria of Article 56 EPC. D2 represented the closest prior art as it specifically related to the same purpose as the patent, i.e., hair conditioning. However, starting from D1 as the closest prior art and particularly from the example on page 72 of this document, the difference with the claimed compositions lay in the content of volatile linear alkanes. Test reports D5, D6/D6a, and D8 demonstrated that improved performance in terms of conditioning properties (smoothing, lightness, and softness of hair) was obtained for the claimed compositions compared to that of the example on page 72 of D1. It was credible that these effects were achieved across the entire scope of the claims. The objective technical problem was therefore the use of a composition that improves the conditioning properties of hair. Nothing in D1, D3, D4, or D7 encouraged the skilled person to work within the claimed range of volatile linear alkanes to achieve such improved properties. The subject matter of the claims as granted therefore involved an inventive step.

c) The same reasoning applied to auxiliary requests 1 to 3, which also met the criteria of Article 56 EPC. In particular, the technical effects demonstrated in D6/D6a and/or D8 could a fortiori be extrapolated to the ranges of volatile linear alkanes as restricted in these auxiliary requests.

XIII. The arguments put forward by the appellant - opponent, insofar as they are relevant to the present decision, can be summarized as follows:

a) Document D7 should be admitted into the appeal proceedings as it attested to the general knowledge of the skilled person.

b) The patent as granted did not meet the criteria of Article 56 EPC. D1 represented the closest prior art as it concerned the same technical field and described products possessing a large part of the characteristics of the claimed compositions. The difference between the claimed composition and that of the closest example in D1 (example on page 72 of D1) lay in the content of volatile linear alkanes. As stated during the oral proceedings, the test reports D5, D6/D6a, and D8 did not demonstrate that improved performance in terms of conditioning properties (smoothing, lightness, and softness of hair) was obtained for the entire range of claimed compositions, i.e., for the entire range of volatile linear alkane content claimed. The objective technical problem was therefore the use of an alternative composition for hair care. D1 described ranges of volatile linear alkane contents overlapping with the claimed range. It would therefore have been obvious for the skilled person to use such contents. The subject matter of the claims as granted did not involve an inventive step.

c) In the case of auxiliary requests 1 to 3 containing restricted ranges of volatile linear alkane contents compared to the claims as granted, the skilled person would have considered the technical effects as demonstrated in D6/D6a and/or D8 to be expected. It was indeed known from D3 and D4 that higher linear alkanes were useful as conditioning agents in hair care products. D7, representing the general knowledge of the skilled person, also described the use of mixtures of higher alkanes as oily bases in hair care products aimed at maintaining the properties of healthy hair such as, for example, shine and a smooth hair feel. Furthermore, D1 and D4 disclosed preferred ranges of contents corresponding to those claimed. Thus, it would have been obvious for the skilled person to increase the amount of volatile linear alkanes in the disclosed ranges to improve conditioning properties. Auxiliary requests 1 to 3 therefore did not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC in view of D1 alone or in combination with D3 or D4.","Reasons for the decision

1. Admission of new evidence

1.1 Document D7

1.1.1 The applicant - patent holder contested the admission of document D7 in the appeal proceedings on the grounds that its submission was late and should have occurred during the opposition proceedings.

1.1.2 Document D7 was submitted by the opposing applicant with the appeal brief on August 4, 2020. Its admission in the appeal proceedings must therefore be decided based on Article 12(4) RPCR 2020, which provides for consideration, among other things, of the complexity of the document, its relevance to addressing the issues that led to the contested decision, and the principle of procedural economy.

1.1.3 As indicated by the opposing applicant, this document attests to the general knowledge of the skilled person. This excerpt from a manual contributes to a better understanding of the state of the art and its examination requires limited time (the excerpt contains only three pages) which does not cause procedural delay.

1.1.4 Consequently, document D7 is admitted into the appeal proceedings (Article 12(4) RPCR 2020).

1.2 Documents D6a, D8, and D9

Documents D6a, D8, and D9 were submitted by the applicant - patent holder with their response to the appeal brief on December 23, 2020. No request against the admission of these documents was made. These documents are therefore admitted into the appeal proceedings.

Main request - Patent as granted

2. Inventive step

2.1 Closest prior art

2.1.1 The opposed patent concerns the use of a composition comprising at least two volatile linear alkanes, one or more solid fatty alcohols, and one or more polymeric thickening agents with sugar motifs for the cosmetic treatment of keratin fibers. The objective of the patent is, among other things, to improve the cosmetic properties of hair such as smoothness, lightness, and flexibility (cf. paragraphs [0005] to [0007] of the opposed patent).

2.1.2 The opposition division and the opposing applicant considered document D1, particularly the example on page 72 (""Hair Cream Gloss & Conditioning""), as the closest state of the art. In its written submissions, the applicant - patent holder, on the other hand, was of the opinion that document D2 represents a better starting point.

2.1.3 Contrary to the opinion of the applicant - patent holder, D2 is not closer to the opposed patent in terms of objective than D1. Although D1 discloses a large number of different types of formulations (i.e., not only hair treatment formulations), all formulations are presented as equivalent alternative formulations. Furthermore, the example on page 72 considered as the starting point in the opposition division's decision (""Hair Cream Gloss & Conditioning"") is not an isolated example of hair treatment. The board notes that D1 describes 16 examples of formulations for hair treatment (cf. pages 68-74). D1 indeed relates to hair treatment, particularly conditioning. Moreover, D1 provides a detailed example of a composition that also specifies the amounts used for the various components. In contrast, D2 relates to a commercial shampoo. The list of ingredients is disclosed, but no quantities are specified.

2.1.4 The board therefore considers that D1 represents the closest state of the art.

2.2 Distinctive feature

The composition for the treatment of keratin fibers defined in claim 1 as granted is distinguished from that described on page 72 of D1 (""Hair Cream Gloss & Conditioning"") by the content of volatile linear alkanes (1.1% to 50% by weight according to claim 1 of the opposed patent versus 1% by weight in the example of D1).

2.3 Technical effect and objective technical problem

2.3.1 The parties disagreed regarding the technical effect resulting from the distinctive feature compared to D1.

2.3.2 According to the applicant - patent holder, this distinctive feature resulted in improved performance in terms of hair conditioning (smoothness and lightness). In this regard, they referred to the results provided in D6/D6a but also in D5 and in examples 1 and 2 of the patent.

2.3.3 The board notes that the results of the comparative tests provided in D6/D6a show that the use of compositions comprising 2.5% and 12% by weight of volatile linear alkanes according to claim 1 leads to an improvement in the smoothness of wet hair and the lightness of dry hair compared to a composition according to the example of D1 comprising 1% by weight of volatile linear alkanes.

However, as already noted by the opposition division in its decision, this improvement does not appear to be linear with respect to the increase in the content of volatile linear alkanes since the improvement is greater at a content of 2.5% than at 12%.

Moreover, the lower limit of the claimed weight content range is 1.1%. This value is much closer to that of the composition used in the example of D1 (i.e., 1%) than to that of the composition according to the invention tested in D6/D6a (i.e., 2.5%). It is therefore impossible to conclude that the improvement in terms of the smoothness of wet hair and the lightness of dry hair observed for the two specific compositions tested in D6/D6a would also be observed with a composition having a content of volatile linear alkanes of 1.1% by weight.

A similar reasoning applies to the upper limit of the claimed weight content range due to the lack of linearity between the increase in alkane content and the improvement of the aforementioned hair properties. It is impossible to conclude that the improvement in terms of the smoothness of wet hair and the lightness of dry hair observed for the two specific compositions tested in D6/D6a would also be observed with a composition having a content of volatile linear alkanes of more than 12% by weight.

The effect observed for the two individual compositions tested in D6/D6a cannot therefore be credibly extrapolated to the entirety of the claimed range.

2.3.4 The test conducted in D5 compares the results obtained in terms of the smoothness of wet hair for a composition according to the invention having a content of a mixture of volatile linear alkanes (mixture of dodecane and tetradecane) of 10% by weight compared to a composition containing 10% by weight of dodecane only. These results do not demonstrate an effect related to the distinctive feature compared to the closest prior art, i.e., the total content of the mixture of volatile linear alkanes. Furthermore, the test conducted, although it seems similar in terms of protocol to that of D6/D6a, relies on expert evaluation. A direct comparison of the results obtained in D5 with those obtained in D6/D6a therefore appears inappropriate.

2.3.5 The additional results provided in D8 concern the evaluation of the flexibility of dry hair for the use of a composition according to the invention having a content of volatile linear alkanes of 1.7% by weight compared to a composition having a corresponding content of 1%. For reasons similar to those detailed for the results of D6/D6a, the improvement in the flexibility of dry hair in the case of this isolated composition cannot be extrapolated to the entirety of the claimed range ranging from 1.1% to 50% by weight.

2.3.6 Therefore, an improvement in hair properties (in terms of the smoothness of wet hair, lightness of dry hair, and/or flexibility of dry hair) has not been credibly demonstrated across the entire scope of the claims.

2.3.7 It follows that the objective technical problem can only be defined as the use of an alternative cosmetic composition for the cosmetic treatment of keratin fibers.

2.4 Obviousness of the proposed solution

2.4.1 The board notes that the content of volatile linear alkanes in the cosmetic compositions according to D1 is not particularly restricted. Furthermore, D1 discloses preferred ranges of volatile linear alkane content of at least 6 to 36%, 3 to 30%, and 1.8 to 15% by weight (cf. paragraph [0039] of D1; ranges of hydrocarbon content, of which at least 60% by weight corresponds to the mixture of linear hydrocarbons in C11 and C13). D1 generally suggests the use of volatile linear alkanes at contents inter alia higher than that of the closest example of the claimed subject matter (1%; example on page 72 of D1) and falling within the claimed range (1.1% to 50%). In the absence of a particular effect, the claimed range of volatile linear alkane content therefore constitutes an arbitrary choice among the disclosure of D1.

2.5 For these reasons, the ground for opposition based on the lack of inventive step of the claimed subject matter (Articles 100(a) and 56 EPC) opposes the maintenance of the patent as granted.

Auxiliary requests 1 to 2

3. Inventive step

3.1 In claims 1 of auxiliary requests 1 and 2, the ranges of volatile linear alkane content have been limited to 1.5% to 20% (auxiliary request 1) and 2% to 20% (auxiliary request 2) by weight, respectively.

3.2 For the same reasons detailed for the main request, i.e., due to the lack of linearity in the improvement of styling properties as a function of the content of volatile linear alkanes, the board considers that it is not possible to credibly extrapolate the results obtained in D6/D6a or D8 for compositions having contents of 1.7%, 2.5%, and 12% to compositions having a content of volatile linear alkanes greater than 12% by weight.

3.3 In this context, the applicant - patent holder explained during the oral proceedings that:

- A content of 12% by weight is about 5 times higher than a content of 2.5%. Yet the scores assessing the conditioning properties provided for these two compositions in D6/D6a vary very little (4.5 to 4 and 3.9 to 3),

- In contrast, the scores provided in D6/D6a assessing these properties for a composition according to D1 having a content of 1% by weight are much lower (2.9 and 2.4),

- A content of 20% by weight is only about 1.7 times higher than a content of 12%. Thus, even if the scores assessing the conditioning properties for a composition having a content of 20% by weight could indeed decrease, it would be credible that they remain higher than those obtained by the composition according to D1 having a content of 1% by weight.

3.4 This argument is not convincing as it presupposes a proportional relationship between the reduction of conditioning properties and the increase in the content of volatile linear alkanes. Such a relationship has not been established. The argument of the applicant - patent holder remains a mere allegation. No data has been provided to credibly conclude that the properties measured in D6/D6a or D8 will be further improved for any content between 12% and 20% by weight.

3.5 The same reasoning developed for the main request (cf. point 2.) therefore applies mutatis mutandis to auxiliary requests 1 and 2.

3.6 Consequently, auxiliary requests 1 and 2 do not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC.

Auxiliary request 3

4. Amendments

4.1 Auxiliary request 3 differs from the main request in that the range of volatile linear alkane content has been limited to 1.5% to 10% by weight.

4.2 The opposing applicant did not raise any objection under Articles 123(2) and 123(3) EPC. The board considers that auxiliary request 3 meets the requirements of Articles 123(2) and 123(3) EPC.

5. Inventive step

5.1 As with the main request, D1 represents the closest prior art. The composition for the treatment of keratin fibers defined in claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 is distinguished from that described on page 72 of D1 (""Hair Cream Gloss & Conditioning"") by the content of volatile linear alkanes (1.5% to 10% by weight according to claim 1 of the opposed patent versus 1% by weight in the example of D1).

5.2 The limitation of the upper limit of the range of volatile linear alkane content to a value between those of the compositions tested in D6/D6a (i.e., 2.5% and 12%) allows for the consideration that an improvement in conditioning properties is credibly obtained up to this value (10%).

Moreover, the lower limit of the claimed range (i.e., 1.5%) is now closer to the content of the composition tested in D8 (1.7%) than to that of the composition of the example on page 72 of D1 (1%). As explained by the applicant - patent holder, an extrapolation of the improved results in terms of conditioning properties obtained in D8 to a composition having a content of volatile linear alkanes between 1.5% and 1.7% is therefore credible.

It follows that an improvement in conditioning properties (smoothness of wet hair and lightness of dry hair and/or flexibility of dry hair) compared to the composition of the closest prior art has been credibly demonstrated across the entire claimed range.

5.3 Therefore, the technical problem to be solved lies in the use of a cosmetic composition for the cosmetic treatment of keratin fibers having improved conditioning properties.

5.4 Contrary to the opinion of the opposing applicant, none of the prior art documents cited by the parties suggests that increasing the content of volatile linear alkanes in the composition of the example on page 72 of D1 to a specific value between 1.5% and 10% would improve the conditioning properties. In particular, the demonstrated technical effects were not expected in view of documents D1, D3, D4, and D7 cited by the opposing applicant, for the following reasons:

a) D1 does not mention at all that the content of volatile linear alkanes is related to any conditioning effect. In this context, the fact that D1 describes preferred ranges of contents overlapping with the claimed range is not relevant, as these preferred ranges are not linked to any particular effect. Furthermore, as pointed out by the applicant - patent holder during the oral proceedings, D1 also discloses a composition having a content of volatile linear alkanes lower than that of the composition of the example on page 72 (cf. 2nd example on page 73 of D1; content of 0.2%). The skilled person would therefore not have found in D1 any indication to increase the content of volatile linear alkanes within the claimed range in order to improve the conditioning properties of the composition.

b) As indicated by the opposing applicant, D3 indeed concerns the use of a mixture of C8 to C14 n-alkanes as inter alia hair care. However, D3 does not disclose any particular content of the alkane mixture within a composition.

c) D4 concerns a conditioning treatment for hair comprising 1-13% by weight, preferably 2-10% by weight, of conditioning agent chosen from hydrocarbons, silicones, and their mixture (cf. claim 1 and page 4 last paragraph). As pointed out by the opposing applicant, among hydrocarbons, volatile linear alkanes in C10, C11, C13, C14 and their mixtures are cited as examples (cf. page 3 lines 19-24). The objective of improving conditioning properties is also disclosed very generally (cf. page 2 lines 29-30). However, D4 does not provide any particular motivation to choose a mixture of alkanes. Indeed, silicones are described as the preferred conditioning agents in D4, and the only example of D4 using a hydrocarbon contains only a single alkane (no mixture). Furthermore, D4 does not describe any link between a mixture of volatile linear alkanes at a specific content and an increase in the conditioning properties as described in D6/D6a and D8.

d) D7 describes the use of higher alkane mixtures as oily bases in hair care products (cf. paragraph under ""Haarpflegemittel"" pages 1681 to 1682). In the same passage, D7 also mentions that the objective of hair care in general is to maintain the properties of healthy hair such as, for example, shine or a smooth hair feel. Even if, as argued by the opposing applicant, these properties could be considered as overlapping with those demonstrated by the applicant - patent holder in D6/D6a and D8, it remains that D7 provides no indication regarding the content of volatile linear alkanes to be used, let alone for the purpose of improving the conditioning properties as described in D6/D6a and D8.

5.5 The subject matter of claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 therefore involves an inventive step. In the absence of other objections, the same reasoning applies mutatis mutandis to claims 2 to 15 of said request. The board thus concludes that auxiliary request 3 meets the requirements of Article 56 EPC.","Device, For these reasons, it is decided as follows, The contested decision is annulled., The case is referred back to the opposition division in order to maintain the patent as modified based on claims 1-15 of the auxiliary request 3 filed on January 10, 2020, and a description to be adapted.",the patent has been granted,the patent has been granted,,Henkel AG & Co.

I. The applicant's appeal is directed against the decision of the examining division to reject European patent application No. 13 808 119.5 for failure to meet the requirements set out in Articles 84 and 123(2) EPC as well as for lack of inventive step in view of documents D4 (Marinkovic et al, ""Microstructural Characterization of Mechanically Activated ZnO-Cr2O3 System"", J. Europ. Ceram. Soc., 25 (2005), pages 2081-2084), D6 (CN 102 671 670 A), D7 (CN 101 385 977 A) or D9 (WO 00/03947 A1).

II. In her statement of grounds of appeal, the applicant requested the annulment of the contested decision and the grant of a patent based on the claims of the main request, or, alternatively, based on one of auxiliary requests 1-8, all filed with said statement.

III. Following a telephone conversation with the applicant's representative, during which the board raised a lack of inventive step regarding claim 1 of the main request, the applicant, in a letter dated March 18, 2021, submitted new requests reversing the main request and auxiliary request 1, while the numbering of auxiliary requests 2 to 8 remained unchanged. Claim 1 of the new main request is worded as follows:

""1. A method for preparing a fluorination catalyst, comprising the reactive grinding of a first reactant which is a chromium oxide compound with a second reactant chosen from CaCr2O7, CaCrO4, Ca3Cr2O8, CaCrO4, CrVO4, Cr2V4O13, NiCr2O4, NiCrO4, CuCrO4, CdCrF5, Pb3Cr2F12, Pb4CrF11, Pb5CrO8, Pb2CrO5, PbCrO4, Pb5CrF17, Pb5W3O9F10, CrF2, CrF3, CrOF2, CuF2, PbF2, BiF3, BiF5, CdF2, NiF2, YF3, MoF3, MoF4, MoF5, MoF6, MoOF4, GeF2, GeF4, SbF3, SbF5, BaF2, LaF3, LaOF, PF3, SrF2, WF4, WF5, WF6, WOF4, ZnF2, MnF3, MnF2, SnF2, SnF4, CaF2, NbF3, NbF4, NbF5, NbO2F, MgF2, CeF4, TiF3, TiF4, TaF5, ThF4, FeF3, AlF3, ScF3, CeF4, Cr-substituted Mn2O3, Mn-substituted Cr2O3, MoO2,4F0,6, Mo4O11,2F0,8 and combinations thereof, characterized in that following the reactive grinding step, a fluorination step is carried out by contacting with a fluorination agent.""

IV. The board being of the opinion that the main request complies with the requirements of the EPC, a written decision may be taken without holding oral proceedings.","Reasons for the decision

1. Main request - Articles 83 and 84 EPC

For the Board, the requirements of Articles 83 and 84 EPC are fulfilled for the following reasons.

1.1 The clarity objection raised in the first instance presented the feature ""fluorination catalyst"" as not clearly limiting the scope of the claims to a catalyst used for fluorination purposes, so that this feature had to be interpreted broadly. In the present request, claim 1 has been limited by a fluorination step, which clearly highlights the belonging of said catalyst to this type of use, so that the clarity objection raised is no longer relevant.

1.2 The invention is also considered to be sufficiently disclosed within the meaning of Article 83 EPC, particularly in view of the content of the first paragraph on page 9 and example 2 on page 10, which describe in detail a reactive grinding process with specific operating conditions, in which the reactants are respectively CrO3 and chromium fluoride.

2. Main request - Article 123(2) EPC

The subject matter of this request meets the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

2.1 Claim 1 corresponds to a combination of claims 1, 4, and 5 as filed, and claims 2 to 6 are based respectively on claims 2 to 4, 7, and 8 as filed.

The subject matter of the claims as thus amended does not extend beyond the content of the application as filed, and the objection raised by the examining division is no longer relevant.

3. Main request - Novelty

This request meets the requirements of Article 54 EPC.

3.1 Documents D4, D6, D7, and D9 do not disclose any of the second reactants from the list of claim 1. Furthermore, the preparation processes in these documents do not include a fluorination step of products resulting from reactive grinding.

3.2 Document D1 (FR 2 684 567 A1) describes (page 3) the preparation of fluorination catalysts by gelation, with the products used to prepare said catalysts including (page 4) a chromium precursor such as one of the chromium oxides and a nickel precursor such as hydroxide, one of the oxyhalides, nickel nitrate, or nickel sulfate.

Document D2 (EP 0 657 408 A1) describes (page 4, lines 12-14) the preparation of fluorination catalysts based on chromium oxide or chromium oxide and at least one other catalytically active metal, characterized in that the majority of the oxides are in a crystallized state. Various known techniques are employed, for example co-precipitation in the form of hydroxides of different metal salts or the reduction of CrO3. The crystallized phase is preferentially chosen from the oxides Cr2O3, CrO2, NiCr2O4, NiCrO3, NiCrO4, MgCrO4, ZnCr2O4, or a mixture of these oxides.

Thus, both documents D1 and D2 provide for the preparation of a fluorination catalyst using chromium oxide as a precursor. However, they do not disclose either the use of reactive grinding or the second reactant defined in claim 1. And even though the list disclosed in D2 includes chromium oxide and a second reactant chosen from a long list of which two (NiCr2O4, NiCrO4) fall under the wording of claim 1, a double selection is necessary to arrive at a pair of reactants falling under the wording of the claim in question.

3.3 The subject matter of claim 1 therefore does not directly and unambiguously derive from any of the aforementioned documents and is thus novel in view of the cited prior art.

4. Main request - Inventive step

The subject matter of the claims complies with the requirements of Article 56 EPC for the following reasons:

4.1 Closest prior art

The processes disclosed in documents D1 and D2 regarding the preparation of fluorination catalysts based on chromium oxides represent a realistic starting point for the development of a process for obtaining a fluorination catalyst. For the Board, D2 is closest to the invention as it refers not only to chromium oxide but also to the two substances NiCr2O4 and NiCrO4 that are part of the list of second reactants according to claim 1.

The processes according to documents D4, D6, D7, and D9 do include a reactive grinding step, but since they do not refer to fluorination at all, they are considered conceptually further removed from the scope of the invention.

4.2 Problem solved by the invention

According to page 1, line 31 - page 2, line 5 of the application as filed, the invention aims to solve the problems associated with the use of co-precipitation to obtain catalysts, such as their limited flexibility, the heterogeneous compositions thus obtained, and the excessive consumption of water and energy during their preparation.

The use of reactive grinding plausibly resolves at least some of these problems, particularly in view of the high energy and water consumption of methods such as co-precipitation, which requires the implementation of aqueous solutions and temperature control.

The problem supposedly solved in relation to the prior art according to D2 is therefore to provide an alternative process for the preparation of a fluorination catalyst that overcomes some of the shortcomings of conventionally used catalyst preparation techniques.

4.3 Non-obvious solution

4.3.1 The examining division argued that the use of reactive grinding was well known to the skilled person and particularly from documents D4, D6, D7, or D9. Furthermore, document D9 would indicate (page 11, line 30 to page 12, line 2) that the choice of reactants is not decisive for obtaining the desired compounds, such as mixed oxides, so that the subject matter according to claim 1 was based on trivial considerations.

4.3.2 The Board certainly shares the examining division's view that reactive grinding and its advantages are well known in the field of catalysts and particularly from D4, D6, D7, or D9. However, the Board cannot agree with the conclusion that the teaching of D2 combined with that of any of documents D4, D6, D7, or D9 would lead the skilled person in an obvious manner to the claimed subject matter.

Indeed, there is no teaching in these four documents to implement a pair of reactants as defined in claim 1. The list of substances according to claim 4 of D2 does mention chromium oxide and two substances contained in the list of second reactants of claim 1 (NiCr2O4 and NiCrO4), but there is no particular incentive in D2 to combine specifically chromium oxide with either of these two reactants. Furthermore, since these two substances are disclosed in claim 4 of D2 as being crystallized phases obtained by co-precipitation, it is unclear why the skilled person would also consider them in the context of a reactive grinding process.

Moreover, the passage from page 11, line 30 - page 12, line 2 of D9 cited by the examining division does not allow for the conclusion that the choice of reactants is not decisive for obtaining the desired compounds. This passage simply indicates that for the purposes of preparing catalysts in this document, the proposed oxides could be replaced by certain salts such as hydroxides, carbonates, nitrates, oxalates, or chlorides. Aside from the fact that none of these salts falls within the list of second reactants according to claim 1, there is no reason to conclude that a skilled person trying to prepare the catalysts of D2 would consider the reactants proposed in D9, which aims to prepare catalysts different from those of D2 and which are not intended to be subjected to a fluorination step, let alone intended to be used as fluorination catalysts.

The subject matter of claim 1 is therefore considered not to derive in an obvious manner from the cited prior art. This conclusion also applies to the subject matter of claims 2 to 6, which depend on that of claim 1.

5. It follows from the above that the main request complies with the requirements of the EPC.","Device, For these reasons, it is decided as follows: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2. The case is referred back to the examining division with the order to grant a patent based on claims 1 to 6 according to the main request as submitted with the letter of March 18, 2021, and a description to be adapted.",no opposition filed within time limit,no opposition filed within time limit,decision under appeal is set aside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. The appeal of the patent holders (hereinafter referred to as ""the appellants"") is directed against the decision of the opposition division by which European patent No. 3 107 556 (""the patent"") was revoked.

II. In the contested decision, the opposition division examined the sets of claims according to a modified main request and three auxiliary requests.

III. The opposition division considered that the amendments made to claims 9 and 10 of the main request did not contravene Article 123(2) EPC.

IV. The new ground of opposition introduced by the opponent in its letter of November 18, 2020, namely two months before the oral proceedings, concerning insufficiency of disclosure (Article 100(b) EPC) was admitted into the proceedings.

V. Regarding the main request, the opposition division concluded that the patent did not meet the requirements of Article 83 EPC, given that the disclosure did not contain sufficient information to render credible that a person skilled in the art could use the peptide AP to treat or prevent diabetes with a dose different from 5 or 3000 mg (point 6.10 of the reasons).

VI. The opposition division did not admit auxiliary requests 1 to 3, submitted by email during the oral proceedings. It admitted document D26 submitted by letter of November 18, 2020, but did not admit documents D22 to D25, D27, and D28 (all submitted by letter of November 18, 2020), D29 (submitted by letter of November 19, 2020), and D30 (submitted by letter of January 19, 2021).

VII. In their appeal, the appellants submitted sets of claims of a main request, identical to the main request on which the contested decision was based, and auxiliary requests 1 to 7, submitted for the first time with the appeal.

VIII. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

""1. Composition comprising at least one peptide AP for use in the prevention and/or treatment of type 2 diabetes.""

IX. The opponent (the respondent) responded to the appeal.

X. The appellants subsequently submitted a set of claims according to a new auxiliary request 8.

XI. The following documents are cited in this decision:

XII. The Board summoned the parties to oral proceedings.

XIII. In accordance with Article 15(1) RPCR, the Board notified its preliminary opinion to the parties. It indicated, among other things,

- that the amendments made to claims 9 and 10 of the main request did not contravene the provisions of Article 123(2) EPC,

- that it was inclined to overturn the decision by which the opposition division admitted the new ground of opposition,

- that it did not consider either document D16 or document D18 as prima facie relevant and would therefore be inclined to rule the new ground of insufficiency of disclosure (Article 100(b) EPC) inadmissible.

XIV. The respondent subsequently withdrew its request for oral proceedings, provided that the Board remits the case to the opposition division for examination of novelty and inventive step.

XV. The appellants withdrew their request for oral proceedings, provided that the Board confirms the inadmissibility of the new ground of opposition and remits the case to the opposition division for examination of novelty and inventive step.

XVI. The Board canceled the oral proceedings.

XVII. The arguments of the appellants can be summarized as follows:

Main Request

Admissibility of the New Ground of Opposition

For a ground of opposition to be prima facie relevant, it must apply the standard of conviction beyond reasonable doubt.

However, the doubt that the opponent attempted to raise by invoking D16 is contradicted by the data from D18 which, in part 2 of the report, clearly demonstrate that a product containing 500 mg/kg of Pep2dia® has a significant effect on blood glucose levels in mice, which can easily be converted to a dosage of 8 mg for a human weighing 75 kg. Contrary to what the opposition division indicated in its decision, D18 thus clearly shows that a dosage of 8 mg is effective in the treatment or prevention of type 2 diabetes.

Furthermore, a statistically non-significant data point, namely with an inappropriate power for the high dose (7.68 mg AP), does not allow for a conclusion of absence of effect in the clinical study presented in document D16 (point 6.4 of the decision). Thus, document D16 is not ""prima facie relevant"" with regard to the high dose and does not justify the introduction of a new ground of opposition.

Admissibility of Documents D26 to D28

The late submission of D26 was not justified. The respondent should have introduced this document during the opposition period. This document also does not address a question raised by the preliminary opinion of the opposition division. Moreover, document D26 is not relevant, as its content is incomplete and erroneous and does not provide any additional teaching compared to document D6.

XVIII. The arguments of the respondent can be summarized as follows:

Main Request

Admissibility of the New Ground of Opposition

The new ground of opposition was presented in response to documents D16 and D18 (particularly D16) submitted by the patent holders with their response to the notice of opposition. Document D16 reports on a clinical trial involving the dipeptide AP, and the authors indicated that for a certain dosage of the dipeptide AP, no significant difference was observed compared to the placebo.

Document D16 is a post-published scientific article, which cannot be easily found during a search for prior art. Document D18 is an internal and confidential report from May 2020 and is not accessible to third parties. Consequently, the new ground of opposition could not have been raised earlier, as rightly mentioned by the opposition division in point 4.2 of its decision.

Even if the new ground of opposition were considered to have been filed late, the opposition division would still have an obligation to examine the relevance of the new ground of opposition and to admit it if deemed prima facie relevant.

A complete reading of document D16 reveals that the same active ingredient as specified in claim 1 of the contested patent was administered in a clinical study to an appropriate group of patients (prediabetic subjects; see paragraphs [0062] and [0063] of the patent). The reading of document D16 also reveals that a very relevant biological response was observed (postprandial blood glucose; see for example paragraph [0042] of the patent), and that the authors concluded that the ""high dose"" (containing 7.68 mg of dipeptide AP) does not provide a significantly different therapeutic effect from the placebo.

Identifying this very relevant teaching only requires reading document D16 by a person skilled in the art; no further hypothesis or speculation is necessary to reach the conclusion that the embodiments according to the subject matter of the claim do not have the stipulated therapeutic effect - this is explicitly stated by the authors, and D16 therefore meets the criterion of ""prima facie relevance.""

Admissibility of Documents D26 to D28

The teaching of D26 is clearly different from the teaching of D6. As explained in point 9.2 of the contested decision, D26 indeed meets the criterion of ""prima facie relevance.""

Documents D27 and D28 are prima facie very relevant for inventive step.

XIX. Requests

The appellants requested:

- the annulment of the contested decision

- the inadmissibility of the new ground of opposition under Articles 83 and 100(b) EPC

- the maintenance of the patent in the form of its main request or, failing that, in the form of one of auxiliary requests 1 to 8

- the admission of these auxiliary requests at the appeal stage

- the admission of new documents D31 to D35 at the appeal stage

- the inadmissibility of document D26

- the confirmation of the opposition division's decision that documents D22 to D25, D27, D28, and D30 were not admissible

- the remittance of the case, if the patent was considered to comply with the requirements of Article 83 EPC or if the Board were to conclude that the opposition division had not properly exercised its discretion in admitting the new ground of opposition.

The respondent requested:

- that the appeal be dismissed and that the contested decision be confirmed

- that auxiliary requests 1 to 7 not be admitted

- that the Board confirm the admission of document D26

- that documents D27 and D28 be admitted

- that documents D31 to D35 not be admitted

- if any of documents D31 to D35 were to be admitted, that documents D36 and D37 also be admitted

- the remittance of the case, if the patent was considered to comply with the requirements of Article 83 EPC or if the Board were to conclude that the opposition division had not properly exercised its discretion in admitting the new ground of opposition.

The respondent also requested that, if the Board decided to remit the case, it do so with instructions to admit D27 and D28 into the proceedings or to revisit the discussion on the admissibility of these documents.","Reasons for the decision

Admissibility of the new ground for opposition

1. According to opinion G 10/91, as an exception, the opposition division may, pursuant to Article 114(1) EPC, examine other grounds for opposition that, at first glance, seem to wholly or partially oppose the maintenance of the European patent.

2. A board of appeal should only decide differently from the way the first instance exercised its discretion if it concludes that the first instance exercised its discretion based on erroneous principles, failed to consider the correct principles, or exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner, thus exceeding the limits of the discretion conferred upon it (see in this regard in particular decision G 7/93, OJ 1994, 775).

3. In its decision, the opposition division provided several reasons for admitting the new ground:

1) the ground was not late, as it represented ""a reaction to documents D16 and D18 submitted by the patent holder with their response to the notice of opposition"" [and that] ""this objection could not have been raised earlier"" (see point 4.2)

2) the fact that ""the holder himself suggested the need to hear a technical expert in the context of sufficiency of disclosure, [...] is a clear sign that this point needs to be discussed"" (see point 4.5)

3) ""it must be discussed whether the disclosure of documents D16 and D18 raises serious doubts about whether the skilled person can carry out the invention as defined in claims 1 to 4 following the instructions in the patent"" (see point 4.6, first paragraph)

4) ""the holder did not provide [...] reasons why this ground would not be relevant. On the contrary, the holder's arguments were mainly related to the substance of sufficiency of disclosure"" (see point 4.6, second paragraph).

4. The Board is of the opinion that the opposition division exercised its discretion unreasonably for the following reasons.

5. In its decision, the division did not recognize the late nature of the ground for opposition under Article 100(b) EPC (see point 4.2). For the recognition of the late nature of a new ground for opposition, the question of whether the ground was mentioned in the notice of opposition or omitted from it is decisive. In the present case, the new ground is clearly late, as it was not presented in the notice of opposition and was raised for the first time two months before the oral proceedings.

6. In its decision, the division did not indicate why the new ground was prima facie relevant. Although this criterion is mentioned at the beginning of section 4, it is not addressed thereafter. The finding that ""it must be discussed whether the disclosure of documents D16 and D18 raises serious doubts"" (see points 4.6) rather suggests that the opposition division considered the presence of serious doubts to be debatable, which is contrary to the principle of prima facie relevance. Furthermore, the examination of the content of documents D16 and D18 in the contested decision (see points 5.2 to 6.10 of the reasons) and the necessity to interpret the results disclosed in these documents demonstrate that the opposition division considered a detailed analysis of document D16 necessary to assess its relevance.

7. The fact that the holders suggested ""the need to hear a technical expert in the context of sufficiency of disclosure"" represents a defense attempt under Article 113(1) EPC, which cannot be considered as a sign that the new ground was prima facie relevant.

8. The division was also mistaken when it asked the holders to provide reasons why the ""ground would not be relevant."" According to opinion G 10/91, it is rather the opposition division's responsibility to explain why, prima facie, the new ground seems to wholly or partially oppose the maintenance of the contested patent.

9. In conclusion, the Board annuls the decision of the opposition division to admit the new ground of insufficiency of disclosure (Article 100(b) EPC). The Board must therefore re-examine whether the new ground can be admitted into the proceedings. The criteria to be used for this purpose are those applicable to the opposition procedure. In this case, the Board considers the criterion of prima facie relevance to be decisive.

10. The preparations used according to document D16 contain a mixture of peptides, in the form of milk protein hydrolysate, with 94.5% low molecular weight peptides (see document D16, page 5, lines 7 to 10). The probative value of the results reported for the specific effect of peptide AP (present in an average ratio of 0.96 mg to 350 mg) is therefore uncertain. Document D16 discusses the effects of milk peptides rather than those of peptide AP (see document D16: 3.2 and 4. ""Discussion"").

11. Furthermore, the Board notes that document D16 does not consider that the results demonstrate a lack of efficacy of the high dose; it only states that these results lack statistical significance. Statistical significance (p-value) is a relative value that does not allow one to conclude that a fact is true or false, but rather provides an indication of the probability of obtaining the observed results from a test, assuming that the null hypothesis (same effect as placebo) is correct.

12. Document D18 concerns a study on rats using the same product as that used according to document D16. In its reply to the appeal, the respondent relies solely on document D16 for its arguments regarding insufficiency of disclosure.

13. For these reasons, the Board does not consider either document D16 or document D18 to be prima facie relevant and finds the new ground of insufficiency of disclosure (Article 100(b) EPC) inadmissible.

Admissibility of documents D22 to D28 and D30 to D37

14. The decision of the opposition division not to admit documents D22 to D25, D29, and D30 has not been contested at the appeal stage. These documents therefore do not form part of the appeal.

15. None of documents D31 to D37 is necessary or relevant for the Board's decision. There is therefore no need to address the issue of their admissibility.

16. The admissibility of documents D26 to D28 remains contested at the appeal stage (see notice of appeal, points 3, 5, and 6, and response to the notice of appeal, point 5.3).

17. In its decision, the opposition division analyzed documents D26 to D28 taking into account the late filing of these documents and assessing their prima facie relevance for the issues of novelty and inventive step. In doing so, it also compared their disclosure with that of documents already present in the file and evaluated whether the late-filed documents provided additional information.

18. In conclusion, the Board considers that the opposition division did not make an error in exercising its discretion. The decision to admit document D26 and not to admit documents D27 and D28 is therefore confirmed.

Referral (Article 111(1) EPC)

19. The opposition division having not ruled on the grounds for opposition under Article 100(a) EPC, and considering the relevant requests of the parties, the Board finds it appropriate to allow a two-instance examination and, therefore, to refer the case back to the opposition division for examination of novelty and inventive step.","Device, For these reasons, it is decided as follows: 1.

I. The appeal was filed by the opponent (appellant) against the decision of the opposition division finding that the European patent as amended based on the main request filed on December 8, 2020, met the requirements set out in the EPC.

II. The opponent had opposed the patent in its entirety on the grounds specified in Articles 100(a) EPC (novelty and inventive step) and 100(b) EPC.

III. Independent claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

""1. Non-therapeutic cosmetic use of an effective amount of at least one lysate of at least one microorganism of the genus Bifidobacterium to prevent and/or reduce sensations of skin discomfort on sensitive skin, said lysate being in the form of all intracellular biological constituents and constituents of cell walls and membranes, said sensations of skin discomfort being selected from itching, burning sensations, tingling sensations, and/or tightness.""

V. In its decision, the opposition division considered, among other things, that the claims of the main request:

- complied with Articles 123(2) and 123(3) EPC

- satisfied the requirements of Article 83

- furthermore, that the claimed subject matter was novel with respect to documents D3 to D6 and D8 and

- that the claimed subject matter involved an inventive step when considering either document D4 or D5 as the closest prior art

VIII. After receiving the provisional opinion issued by the Board pursuant to Article 15(1) RPCR 2020, the respondent withdrew the main request and auxiliary requests 1 and 2. Furthermore, it submitted a description adapted to the claims of auxiliary request 3.

IX. Independent claim 1 of auxiliary request 3 reads as follows:

""1. Non-therapeutic cosmetic use of an effective amount of at least one lysate of at least one microorganism of the genus Bifidobacterium to prevent and/or reduce sensations of skin discomfort on sensitive skin, said lysate being in the form of all intracellular biological constituents and constituents of cell walls and membranes, said sensations of skin discomfort being selected from itching, burning sensations, tingling sensations, and/or tightness, said lysate being administered topically.""

X. The relevant arguments presented by the appellant for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

- the opposition division's decision not to admit D9 into the opposition proceedings is erroneous and should be overturned

- the claimed invention is not sufficiently disclosed

- the claimed subject matter is not novel with respect to D3, D4, and D5

- the claimed subject matter does not involve an inventive step when considering D3 or, alternatively, D4 or D5 as the closest prior art

XI. The relevant arguments presented by the respondent for the present decision can be summarized as follows:

- The decision not to admit D9 was correct and this document should not have been admitted into the appeal proceedings; D10, submitted with the statement of grounds of appeal, should also not have been admitted

- the claimed invention is sufficiently disclosed

- the claimed subject matter involves an inventive step with respect to the cited prior art

Requests

XII. The appellant requested the annulment of the decision and the revocation of the patent in its entirety.

XIII. The respondent requested the maintenance of the patent based on the claims of auxiliary request 3 submitted with the response to the statement of appeal and the adapted description submitted with its letter of September 12, 2022.","Reasons for the decision

Auxiliary request 3

1. Auxiliary request 3 is the only relevant request, as the main request and auxiliary requests 1 and 2 have been withdrawn by the respondent.

2. Admission of document D9

2.1 D9 was submitted after the opposition period had expired in support of a new objection of insufficiency of disclosure.

2.2 As rightly noted by the respondent, according to the case law of the Boards of Appeal, the facts and evidence invoked by the opponent must be submitted within the nine-month period provided for filing an opposition. Facts and evidence presented after the expiration of this period may also be admitted if they are submitted in response to an argument or question from the opposing party, such that they could not have been provided earlier in the case at hand.

2.3 This situation did not occur in the present case. Therefore, even though it was submitted within the time limit set by Rule 116 EPC, D9 was submitted late and its admission was subject to the discretion of the opposition division (Article 114(2) EPC).

2.4 In its decision, the opposition division correctly established that D9 had been submitted late. Furthermore, it considered that this document did not raise, at first glance, reasonable doubts regarding the possibility of implementing the invention. It notably considered that, even if D9 showed that there were certain differences in the composition of the cell walls of microorganisms of the genus Bifidobacterium, this document remained completely silent regarding the effects on skin discomfort sensations or skin disorders of sensitive skin. For these reasons, it subsequently concluded that D9 was not relevant at first glance and should not be admitted into the opposition proceedings.

2.5 There is no reason to consider that the opposition division exercised its discretion based on erroneous principles, that it did not take into account the correct principles, or that it exercised its discretion unreasonably and thus exceeded the limits of the discretion conferred upon it. Therefore, there is also no reason to overturn its decision to consider D9 inadmissible and to admit it into the appeal proceedings (Article 12(6) RPCR 2020).

3. Sufficiency of disclosure

3.1 The applicant considers that the opposed patent does not contain sufficient information allowing a person skilled in the art, using their general knowledge, to implement the invention across the entire claimed scope. In particular, it considers that there are serious doubts regarding the ability of a person skilled in the art to implement the invention by administering a lysate of a Bifidobacterium microorganism other than Bifidobacterium longum.

3.2 The applicant argued that the patent only shows that a lysate of Bifidobacterium longum can be used to treat skin disorders. Furthermore, that there is no evidence that other types of bifidobacteria can be used to achieve the same effects. It also referred to D9 to prove that the cell wall of other types of Bifidobacterium contains different polysaccharides. This argument is unconvincing. As stated above, D9 should not be admitted into the proceedings and there is no other evidence supporting the applicant's allegations. In particular, there is no evidence that other types of Bifidobacterium are so different that they would not be able to induce the same beneficial effects.

3.3 For these reasons, it is concluded that the claimed invention is sufficiently disclosed (Article 83 EPC).

4. Novelty

4.1 The applicant considers that the claimed subject matter lacks novelty with respect to D3, D4, and D5.

5. Regarding D3: The objection of lack of novelty with respect to D3 is based on the presumption that the products obtained by thermal treatment of Bifidobacterium lactis at 90°C for 2 hours, which are described in examples 5 and 6 of D3, are lysates as defined in independent claims 1 and 6. Furthermore, by mentioning the use for treating sensitive skin, D3 implicitly discloses the treatment and prevention of the specific conditions mentioned in the claims.

5.1 These presumptions are unfounded.

5.2 Upon reading the expression ""all intracellular biological constituents and constituents of the cell walls and membranes"" in claims 1 and 6, a person skilled in the art understands that all components constituting the bacterium must be present in the lysate. One cannot expect this to occur when a bacterial culture is subjected to the extreme conditions mentioned in examples 5 and 6 of D3, namely 90°C for two hours.

5.3 There is no doubt that, as the applicant argued referring to D10, the cells will undergo lysis under these extreme conditions. However, it is not credible that the lysate obtained contains all the biological constituents of the cell. In fact, as mentioned by the respondent, a person skilled in the art would expect that most proteins would be denatured and precipitate under these conditions. This is confirmed by the study disclosed in D11.

5.4 Regarding claim 6, it is also characterized by the presence of a compound likely to induce skin irritation and another associated probiotic microorganism or its lysate. The compositions of examples 5 and 6 of D3 include compounds that may induce skin irritation, such as preservatives, sodium hydroxide, sodium lauryl sulfate. However, the presence of another associated probiotic microorganism or a lysate thereof is not disclosed directly and unequivocally.

5.5 Regarding the claimed uses, the following aspects must also be considered. D3 teaches that the disclosed compositions can be used to treat sensitive skin: see paragraph [0066]. The applicant argued that the treatment of all conditions typically affecting sensitive skin, including those mentioned in claim 1, is implicitly disclosed in D3: in particular, the treatment of itching, burning sensations, tingling and/or tightness is, in their opinion, implicitly disclosed.

5.6 This argument is unconvincing: the fact that these conditions may ""typically"" affect subjects with sensitive skin does not mean that D3 directly and unequivocally discloses their treatment with the compositions according to the invention.

5.7 For these reasons, D3 cannot be considered as destroying the novelty of the claims of the present patent.

5.8 Regarding D4 and D5: these documents disclose cosmetic and dermatological compositions comprising Bifidobacterium that can be administered orally or topically to prevent and/or treat sensitive and/or dry skin and the appearance of discomfort sensations in subjects with sensitive skin. These sensations may include, for example, tingling, itching, burning sensation, warming, and tightness. Erythema and pruritus may also occur in these subjects. Bifidobacterium may be in live, semi-active, or inactivated form.

5.9 The objection of lack of novelty is based on the applicant's presumption that inactivated bacterial cells constitute cellular lysates as defined in the claims.

5.10 This presumption is also incorrect. A bacterium that has been ""inactivated"" does not necessarily undergo lysis and may even, in some cases, be reactivated, as shown in document D12.

5.11 Thus, the mere presence of the term ""inactivated"" relating to a bacterium in D4 and D5 cannot be considered as directly and unequivocally designating a lysate as defined in the present claims. Therefore, D4 and D5 do not disclose a bacterial lysate as defined in the claims.

5.12 The subject matter of independent claims 1 and 6, as well as that of the dependent claims, which have a more limited scope, is therefore novel with respect to D3, D4, and D5 (Article 54(2) EPC).

5.13 Given this conclusion (see in particular point 5.3 above), there is no reason to discuss the admission of document D10, which was submitted by the applicant with the grounds of appeal.

6. Inventive step

6.1 The claimed invention relates to a composition comprising a lysate of a bifidobacterium to prevent and treat certain specific conditions associated with sensitive skin. These conditions include, in particular, sensations such as tingling and/or tightness of the skin, itching, pruritus, and warming sensations.

Closest prior art

6.2 The opposition division decided that D5 and D4 represent the closest prior art. The Board sees no reason to deviate from this choice. These documents, like the patent in question, relate to the use of a composition comprising a Bifidobacterium or a fraction thereof for the treatment of these same disorders in subjects with sensitive skin. According to D5, the Bifidobacterium is Bifidobacterium lactis in combination with Lactobacillus paracasei: see paragraph [0004], [0008], example 10, claim 1 of D5. In particular, example 10 describes trials in which these bacteria induce positive effects on the skin in subjects with sensitive skin. D4 provides similar teaching, and its technical content does not go beyond that of D5. Therefore, the Board will focus on D5 in what follows.

6.3 In its statement of grounds of appeal, the applicant argued that D3 should be considered as the closest prior art instead of D4 or D5. The Board disagrees. D3 discloses the preparation of compositions for cosmetic, pharmaceutical, or veterinary use comprising bacteria or bacterial extracts, including Bifidobacterium, which are intended to stabilize and/or regulate the skin ecosystem of mammals. Among a number of conditions, D3 mentions sensitive skin. However, no mention is made of any of the specific conditions listed in the claims. Furthermore, none of the examples studying the properties of the claimed compositions concern the use of these compositions in subjects with sensitive skin. Therefore, D3 cannot be considered as the closest prior art.

6.4 Distinctive feature

The claimed subject matter differs from the teaching of D5 in that the composition is a ""whole"" lysate, meaning a lysate comprising all biological constituents of the bacterial cell, including intracellular constituents and constituents of the bacterial wall. According to D5, the composition comprises live, dead, or inactivated Bifidobacterium, or one of its fractions or metabolites: see paragraph [0008], claim 1, and example 10. In the composition used in the trials described in example 10, the bacterium is in live form.

Technical effect

6.5 The patent shows that a whole lysate according to the invention is effective in reducing severe tingling sensations in human subjects with sensitive skin, and furthermore that this lysate reduces neurogenic reactions, edema, and inflammation in a human skin model. These trials render credible the idea that the claimed lysate is effective in preventing and treating the conditions mentioned in the claims.

6.6 The applicant argued that there is no evidence that the claimed composition is effective when administered orally. However, since the claimed subject matter of auxiliary request 3 has been limited to topical use, this objection is no longer relevant. The applicant's objection that the patent does not render credible that all types of Bifidobacterium will be able to induce the claimed effects is also unconvincing, for the reasons already presented during the examination of sufficiency of disclosure.

6.7 The respondent provided additional tests showing that the activity of the claimed lysate, comprising all cellular components, is superior to that of compositions comprising only intracellular components or membrane components. However, as noted by the opposition division, these comparative tests do not show that the whole lysate claimed has superior efficacy compared to that disclosed in example 10 of D5, which includes Bifidobacterium in live form.

Underlying problem

6.8 Therefore, the underlying technical problem can be considered as providing an alternative composition for treating conditions associated with sensitive skin that are listed in the claims.

Non-obviousness of the claimed solution

6.9 Neither document D5 nor any of the other cited documents disclose the use of a whole lysate as mentioned in the claims, let alone its use for treating conditions associated with sensitive skin. None of these documents encourages the use of such a lysate. Therefore, none of these documents would prompt the use of a lysate of this type.

6.10 Furthermore, D5 and D4 teach that a combination of a Bifidobacterium and a Lactobacillus, or their fractions or metabolites, is necessary to achieve the relevant effects. A single one of these ingredients is not sufficient. In these documents, a person skilled in the art does not find the slightest hint to conclude that by using a whole lysate of a Bifidobacterium, the inclusion of a component derived from Lactobacterium can be avoided. Thus, D4 and D5 do not suggest the claimed solution.

6.11 D3 does not suggest the claimed solution either. On the one hand, this document does not mention a whole lysate as defined in the claims and on the other hand, it does not mention the specific conditions that are claimed.

7. The subject matter of independent claims 1 and 6, as well as that of the dependent claims, which have a more limited scope, therefore involves an inventive step (Article 56 EPC).

8. Adaptation of the description

8.1 The respondent submitted a modified description, adapted to the claims of auxiliary request 3. The applicant did not raise any objections to the modifications, nor did the Board.","Device, For these reasons, it is decided as follows: 1. The contested decision is annulled. 2. The case is referred back to the opposition division for the patent to be maintained as modified in the following version: Description: Pages: 2 to 16 submitted with the letter of September 12, 2022; Claims: No. 1 to 10 of the auxiliary request 3 submitted with the response to the statement of grounds of appeal.",patent maintained as amended,patent maintained as amended,decision under appeal is set aside,N.V.

I. The applicant (opponent) has filed an appeal against the decision of the opposition division to reject his opposition to the grant of European patent No. 2 198 927, the independent claim 1 of which reads as follows:

""1. Composition for coloring human keratin fibers, characterized in that it comprises, in a cosmetically acceptable medium:

(a) at least 25% by weight of one or more fats different from fatty acids;

(b) 1 to 10% by weight of one or more non-ionic surfactants comprising at least 10 moles and at most 80 moles of ethylene oxide;

(c) one or more dyes chosen from oxidation dyes;

(d) at least one oxidizing agent;

(e) one or more alkalizing agents;

the acceptable medium comprising:

(f) water; and

(g) at least one organic solvent chosen from linear or branched monoalcohols or diols, preferably saturated, comprising 2 to 10 carbon atoms, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, hexylene glycol (2-methyl 2,4-pentanediol), neopentyl glycol, and 3-methyl-1,5-pentanediol; aromatic alcohols such as benzyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol; glycerol; polyols or polyol ethers such as, for example, the monomethyl, monoethyl, and monobutyl ethers of ethylene glycol, 2-butoxyethanol, propylene glycol or its ethers such as, for example, the monomethyl ether of propylene glycol, butylene glycol, dipropylene glycol; as well as alkyl ethers of diethylene glycol, notably in C1-C4, such as, for example, the monoethyl ether or the monobutyl ether of diethylene glycol, alone or in mixture.""

II. The opposition was filed with a view to obtaining the revocation of the patent in its entirety for lack of novelty and inventive step (Article 100(a) EPC), based, among other things, on the documents

(1) JP-A-63-174917,

(2) English translation of document (1),

(3) JP-A-09-249537,

(4) English translation of document (3),

(5) JP-A-2003-55174,

(6) English translation of document (5),

(7) WO-A-200 6136303, and

(8) EP-A-1757328.

According to the opposition division, the composition of example 2 of document (1) did not contain an oxidation dye, document (3) did not disclose compositions meeting the characteristics (a) and (b) of the claim of the patent as granted, and the composition of comparative example 6 of document (5) did not contain an organic solvent as referred to in characteristic (g) of claim 1. The subject matter of the claims of the patent as granted was therefore novel over documents (1), (3), and (5).

The closest prior art to the invention was document (5). The technical problem to be solved was the improvement of dyeing properties, particularly in terms of color selectivity. The solution was the composition of claim 1 of the patent as granted characterized by a fat content of at least 25% by weight and the presence of an organic solvent.

The comparative tests submitted by the patent owner with a letter dated June 9, 2020 (document 9) and March 5, 2021 (document 10) showed that this problem of improving coloration was solved by the compositions of claim 1 of the patent as granted.

None of the cited documents suggested the addition of an organic solvent and the increase of the fat content in oxidation dye compositions in order to improve the homogeneity of the coloration.

Therefore, the subject matter of the claims of the patent as granted involved an inventive step.

III. According to the applicant, the subject matter of claim 1 of the patent as granted lacks novelty over documents (1), (3), and (5) and does not involve an inventive step starting from document (5) or document (7) as the closest prior art, in combination with document (7) or (8).

IV. The applicant requests the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

The respondent requests the dismissal of the appeal.

V. The board rendered its decision at the conclusion of the oral proceedings held on November 30, 2023.","Reasons for the decision

Documents (1), (3), and (5) are documents in Japanese that have been supplemented by their translation into English, namely documents (2), (4), and (6), respectively. In the following decision, the cited passages refer to the translations.

Main request: patent as granted

Novelty

According to the applicant, the subject matter of claim 1 of the patent as granted lacks novelty with respect to documents (1), (3), and (5).

1. Document (1)

According to the applicant, the subject matter of claim 1 lacks novelty with respect to example 2 of document (1).

1.1 The composition disclosed in example 2 on page 8 of document (1) does not contain an oxidation dye. However, the composition of the claim of the patent as granted requires one or more dyes chosen from oxidation dyes.

Therefore, the composition of example 2 of document (1) does not anticipate the subject matter of claim 1 of the patent as granted.

1.2 According to the applicant, the disclosure of the composition of example 2 of document (1) must be read in combination with claim 1 of that document, which requires the presence of a dye in the claimed composition.

However, composition 2 is fully defined, with the weight sum of its components being 100%. It cannot, therefore, contain other components.

The applicant cites decision T 332/87, which states that the technical teaching of an example can be combined with other passages of the same document, provided that the example in question is representative or in accordance with the technical teaching of the document.

However, in the present case, the composition of example 2 is neither representative of the teaching of document (1) nor in accordance with the requirements of claim 1 of that document (1) since the composition does not include a dye. Consequently, the considerations of decision T 332/87 do not apply to the case at hand.

1.3 According to the applicant, a dye must necessarily be present in the composition of example 2, which indicates that after applying the composition to the hair followed by rinsing, the desired coloration is obtained.

However, the presence of an oxidation dye is not disclosed in composition 2, which is not contested. On the other hand, the composition of example 2 contains hydrogen peroxide, which is a bleaching agent. Therefore, the application of this composition to the hair leads to a different coloration of the hair, and this occurs without the presence of an oxidation dye. This argument from the applicant must therefore also be dismissed.

1.4 The chamber thus concludes that the subject matter of the claims of the patent as granted is novel with respect to document (1).

2. Document (3)

2.1 This document discloses oxidation dye compositions that are prepared immediately before use by mixing a first composition containing an oxidation dye with a second composition containing an oxidizing agent (see claims 1 and 2).

2.2 Relying on paragraph [0045] of the document, the applicant claims that document (3) discloses the mixing of the composition containing an oxidation dye described in examples 4, 5, or 6 with the oxidizing composition described in table 2 in a 1:1 ratio. The resulting dye compositions from this mixture anticipate the subject matter of claim 1 of the patent as granted.

2.3 However, notwithstanding the fact that paragraph [0045] does not disclose that the first composition is mixed with the second composition in a 1:1 ratio, this paragraph only applies to the compositions evaluated in table 3, namely those of examples 1 to 3.

Document (3) does not disclose that the compositions of examples 4, 5, or 6 are mixed with the composition disclosed in table 2.

In general, document (3) teaches that the mixing of the oxidizing composition with the composition containing the oxidation dye must be carried out in proportions such that the effects of the oxidation dye are not lost [see paragraph 0040].

Thus, even applying the general teaching of document (3) to the compositions containing the oxidation dye from examples 4, 5, or 6 does not necessarily lead to a dye composition containing at least 25% by weight of one or more fatty substances and between 1 to 10% by weight of one or more non-ionic surfactants containing from 10 to 80 moles of ethylene oxide.

2.4 Therefore, the chamber concludes that the subject matter of the claims of the patent as granted is novel with respect to document (3).

3. Document (5)

3.1 Document (5) discloses a hair bleaching or oxidation dye composition that is prepared by mixing at the time of use a first composition containing at least one alkanolamine and a second composition containing at least one oxidizing agent, 1.0 to 5.0% by weight of alkanolamine, 17.5 to 27.0% by weight of an oily component, and 1.75 to 10.0% by weight of a surfactant, the weight ratio between the oily component and the surfactant being less than or equal to 10.0 (see claim 1).

The compositions disclosed in table 1 in paragraph [0044], namely the compositions of examples 1 to 7 and comparative examples 1 to 7, do not contain, except for the composition of comparative example 6, fatty substances in the proportions required by the contested patent (characteristic a).

On the other hand, none of the compositions in table 1 contains the organic solvent required by the compositions of the invention (characteristic (g) of claim 1 of the patent as granted).

3.2 According to the applicant, the composition of comparative example 6 in combination with paragraph [0059] of document (5) destroys the novelty of the subject matter of claim 1 of the patent as granted.

3.3 Paragraph [0059] teaches that it is possible to include a lower alcohol such as ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, N-propanol, or butanol as an anti-foaming agent in the first and second compositions to avoid the formation of foam when mixing the two compositions to obtain the ready-to-use dye composition.

However, this teaching applies to compositions compliant with the invention of document (5), and not to compositions illustrating the state of the art, such as comparative example 6, which are disclosed to compare their dyeing properties with those of the compositions compliant with the invention.

The composition of comparative example 6 cannot therefore be modified taking into account the teaching of paragraph [0059].

3.4 The chamber thus concludes that the subject matter of the claims of the patent as granted is novel with respect to document (5) (Article 54 EPC).

Inventive step

4. Closest prior art

The contested patent aims to improve the dyeing properties of oxidation dye compositions having a high content of fatty substances, particularly in terms of the strength/intensity and/or homogeneity of the dye (see paragraph [0016] of the patent).

4.1 Document (5), like the contested patent, aims to improve hair coloring. Document (5) particularly focuses on the brilliance of the coloration (see paragraph [0004]).

Document (5) discloses hair oxidation dye compositions that are prepared by mixing at the time of use a first composition containing at least one alkanolamine and an oxidation dye, and a second composition containing at least one oxidizing agent, an oily component, and a surfactant (see first embodiment [paragraph [0010], claim 1]).

The ready-to-use dye composition contains 0.1 to 5.0% by weight of alkanolamine, 17.5 to 27.0% by weight of an oily component, preferably 20 to 25% by weight, and 1.75 to 10.0% by weight of a surfactant (see paragraphs [0031] to [0034]). When the surfactant is non-ionic, it is preferably present at 4 to 8% by weight (see paragraph [0036]). The dye composition may also include a lower alcohol such as ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, N-propanol, or butanol as an anti-foaming agent in the first and second compositions to avoid the formation of foam when mixing the two compositions (see paragraph [0059]).

The dye compositions of the contested patent differ from those of document (5) by a slightly higher content of fatty substances and by the presence of a lower alcohol.

4.2 According to the applicant, document (7) also represents the closest state of the art to the invention.

Document (7) relates to hair care and aims to provide new conditioning agents that are stable in storage and that also possess improved hair conditioning properties.

This document thus discloses an aqueous agent for hair conditioning that contains a combination of:

- at least one triacyl (C8-C22) glyceride;

- at least one amphoteric surfactant of formula (I);

- at least one amphoteric and/or cationic polymer (claim 1). The triacylglyceride (fatty substance) is preferably present at between 0.1 and 5% by weight in the composition (page 8, first complete paragraph).

The conditioning agent can be used in oxidation dye compositions (see page 6, lines 12 to 16; tables 1 and 2, composition El (pages 44 to 46). The oxidation dye composition preferably includes an ethoxylated fatty alcohol (between 15 and 100 ethylene oxide units) (page 17, last complete paragraph). Additionally, the composition may include fatty alcohols (page 2, from the 2nd paragraph).

Although the conditioning agent may be used in oxidation dye compositions, the purpose of document (7) is to provide a hair conditioning agent and protect the coloration from external aggressions, such as washing, rubbing, light, cold permanents, or sweat. The compositions of document (7) include for this purpose an amphoteric surfactant of formula (I) and a cationic or amphoteric polymer, which are not required by the compositions of the invention.

Document (7), by its objectives, is further removed from the invention than document (5), which aims to improve coloration.

Regarding the oxidation dye compositions disclosed in document (7), namely the dye compositions prepared with compositions El and E3, these include after mixing with the oxidizing composition in a ratio of approximately 4:5 about 0.5% by weight of macadamia nut oil or sweet almond oil and about 3.2% by weight of fatty alcohol (Lorol tech.). The dye compositions of the patent as granted, on the other hand, require at least 25% by weight of one or more fatty substances. In view of the significant difference in fatty substance content, the chamber concludes that compositions El and E3 are structurally further removed from that of the patent as granted than the dye compositions disclosed in document (5), which preferably include 20 to 25% by weight of oil (see paragraph [0034]).

4.3 Therefore, the chamber, in agreement with the respondent and the opposition division, considers that document (5) represents the closest state of the art to the invention.

5. Technical problem

The technical problem to be solved is the improvement of the dyeing properties of the compositions, notably the reduction of the selectivity of the coloration (paragraphs [0010], [0016], and [0216] of the patent as granted).

6. Solution

The proposed solution is the composition of the claim of the patent as granted comprising at least 25% by weight of fatty substances other than fatty acids, characterized by the presence of an organic solvent defined by characteristic (g).

7. Success

In light of the experimental tests presented in documents (9) and (10), the opposition division concluded that the technical problem as defined above has indeed been solved by the dye compositions of claim 1 of the patent as granted. This point is not contested by the applicant.

8. Evidence

According to the applicant, the proposed solution is obvious in light of document (7) or document (8).

8.1 Document (7) relates to hair care and aims to improve hair conditioning. A person skilled in the art would not have consulted this document to reduce the selectivity of the colorations obtained by the compositions of document (5).

According to the applicant, a person skilled in the art would have consulted document (7) because of the penultimate paragraph on page 4, which mentions the selectivity of colorations.

However, this paragraph relates to the general context of oxidation dyeing. It simply states that oxidation dye precursors must possess good fixation power on the fiber, with no notable difference between damaged hair and newly grown hair, particularly in the case of human hair (selectivity, equalizing power). However, no solution is proposed to reduce the selectivity of the coloration obtained using an oxidation dye.

8.2 Document (8) aims to reduce the application time of dye compositions, without increasing the concentration of the constituents while maintaining a good level of coloration, i.e., good dyeing strength, good color retention against external agents (paragraph [0009]). The objective of the document is therefore to improve the efficiency of bleaching oxidation dye compositions in terms of reaction speed or dye penetration into the fiber, while maintaining good safety, good resistance, and good selectivity (paragraph [0010]). The solution proposed by document (8) is an oxidation dye composition having at least 30% by weight of a non-coloring organic oxygenated compound that is insoluble in water. This compound may be a fatty substance.

This document thus addresses the improvement of the speed of color development while preserving selectivity. However, the improvement of the reduction of the selectivity of colorations is not addressed.

Even if a person skilled in the art were to consult this document to reduce the selectivity of the coloration, they would not arrive at the solution of adding an organic solvent for this purpose.

Document (8) simply reveals that the dye carrier is a cosmetic medium generally consisting of water or a mixture of water and at least one organic solvent, such as alcohols (paragraph [0055]).

However, document (8) does not associate the presence of an organic solvent in the dye carrier with an effect on the coloration, let alone a reduction in the selectivity of the coloration.

9. The Chamber thus concludes that it was not obvious in light of the state of the art to add an organic solvent to the dye compositions of document (5) in order to reduce the selectivity of the coloration.

It follows that the subject matter of claims 1 to 13 of the patent as granted involves an inventive step.","Device, For these reasons, it is ruled as follows, The appeal is rejected.",opposition rejected,opposition rejected,appeal dismissed,Henkel AG & Co.

I. European Patent No. 3 273 934 was granted based on 31 claims.

The wording of independent claim 1 was as follows:

""1. A cosmetic hair treatment method, comprising:

- a step (i) of applying to said hair a so-called first cosmetic composition, comprising one or more cationic surfactants, one or more silicones, and one or more non-silicone fatty substances, and then

- a step (ii) of applying to said hair a so-called second cosmetic composition, comprising one or more cationic surfactants, one or more cationic polymers having a cationic charge density of at least 4 meq/g, and one or more organosilanes;

said method not comprising an intermediate rinsing step between said step (i) and step (ii) of application.""

II. Two oppositions were filed against the granted patent. The patent was opposed on the grounds of Article 100(a) EPC, for lack of novelty and inventive step.

III. The opposition division decided to reject the oppositions (Article 101(2) EPC).

IV. The following documents, cited during the opposition proceedings, remain relevant for the present decision:

D1: Mintel, ""Bouncy & Tender Cream + Intra-Cylane Gel Duo"" Host: Mintel, No. Record ID 2608883, 1.12.2014

D9: Experimental Report

V. In its decision, the opposition division considered that the subject matter of claims 1 to 31 was novel in view of D1 and D5.

Document D3 was considered the closest prior art. The subject matter of claim 1 differed from document D3 by the presence of one or more silicones and one or more non-silicone fatty substances in the first composition, as well as by the presence of one or more cationic surfactants and one or more cationic polymers having a cationic charge density greater than 4 meq/g in the second composition. In view of examples 4 and 5 of the patent and the experimental report D9, the problem was formulated as providing a hair treatment method that improves the wash retention of conditioning and detangling properties of organosilane-based care compositions. The solution was not obvious in view of D3 or D4-D7.

VI. Opponents 01 (hereinafter appellant 01) and 02 (hereinafter appellant 02) filed an appeal against this decision.

VII. In its response to the appellants' appeal briefs dated March 17, 2022, the patent holder (hereinafter respondent) submitted a first auxiliary request.

VIII. For the preparation of the oral proceedings, the Board sent a notification dated March 31, 2023.

IX. The oral proceedings took place on September 7, 2023.

X. The following arguments were presented by the appellants:

Main Request - Novelty

Document D1 disclosed a composition comprising all the ingredients of compositions (i) and (ii). The application of this composition to the hair, particularly when applied multiple times or with a delay of a few seconds, rendered the disclosure of D1 relevant for novelty.

Admissibility of the inventive step objection starting from D1 as the closest prior art

According to appellant 02, this objection should be admitted into the proceedings as document D1 had been introduced at the beginning of the opposition, so there could be no surprises regarding this objection.

Admissibility of the inventive step objection combining D5 with D3 starting from D3

Appellant 01 mentioned that this objection had already been raised during the opposition phase, so it was already part of the proceedings.

Main Request - Inventive Step

The closest prior art was D3. There were three distinguishing features between the claimed subject matter and the compositions of example IV of D3. Furthermore, the subject matter of the patent claim was not restricted by the time separating the two application steps of the compositions, nor by the nature of compositions (i) and (ii) which could be identical. There was no evidence of an effect, either in the examples of the contested patent or in the tests D9, which showed a low effect at T0 for the claimed method. The problem was to provide an alternative method. The solution was obvious in view of examples 2 and 3 of D5.

XI. The following arguments were presented by the respondent:

Main Request - Novelty

D1 did not disclose a double application of two compositions according to claim 1.

Admissibility of the inventive step objection starting from D1

This objection was new and should have been raised during the opposition phase. It should not be admitted.

Admissibility of the inventive step objection combining D5 with D3 starting from D3

This new objection was not admissible as it was presented for the first time in the appeal proceedings.

Main Request - Inventive Step

The problem with respect to D3 was to provide a method to improve wash retention, as demonstrated by D9. The invention was not obvious in view of D4-D7.

XII. Requests

The appellants requested the annulment of the contested decision and the revocation of the patent.

The respondent requested the dismissal of the appeal and, alternatively, the maintenance of the patent based on the first auxiliary request as submitted with the response of March 17, 2022.

The respondent also requested that the objections of lack of inventive step raised by the appellants in their appeal briefs concerning the combination of D5 with D3 and starting from D1 not be admitted into the appeal proceedings.","Reasons for the decision

1. Main request - Patent as granted - Novelty

1.1 Document D1 was cited by applicant 01 in relation to novelty. Applicant 02 also believes that this document is relevant for novelty.

1.2 D1 discloses a device for the care of curly hair comprising two separate compartments, one containing a cream and the other a gel. At the time of use, the user presses the device, causing the two compositions to mix to form a single ready-to-use composition. Document D1 therefore discloses the application in a single step of a ready-to-use composition resulting from the prior mixing of a cream and a gel; the final composition is presented as providing definition to the curls with a soft touch and as detangling curly hair while giving it beautiful volume, protecting it from humidity, and preventing frizz. The ready-to-use composition includes, among other things, cetearyl alcohol, behentrimonium chloride, and dimethicone corresponding to the compounds of composition (i) claimed in the contested patent, as well as aminopropyl triethoxysilane, polyquaternium 37, and dipalmitoylethyl hydroxyethylammonium methosulfate corresponding to the compounds of composition (ii) of the claimed patent.

1.3 This document cannot be relevant for novelty, as it relates to a single composition obtained by the prior mixing of two initial compositions in distinct forms of gel and cream and does not disclose a two-step application process of two distinct compositions as claimed.

The chamber cannot further accept the applicants' argument that successive applications of the final composition disclosed in D1 would deprive the claimed process of novelty, due to the open nature of the definition of compositions (i) and (ii) in claim 1 of the main request, described as ""comprising"" the listed compounds, which would not exclude the presence of other compounds in each composition and thus the successive application of two identical compositions (i) and (ii) corresponding to the final composition disclosed in D1.

The chamber considers that this interpretation of the subject matter of claim 1 of the patent as granted by the applicants is incorrect and would not be adopted by a person skilled in the art. Claim 1 indeed states that the process comprises two distinct and successive steps characterized by the application of two distinct compositions referred to as ""first cosmetic composition"" and ""second cosmetic composition."" The chamber sees no possibility that the two compositions (i) and (ii) are identical. These two features clearly constitute a difference between the claimed subject matter and the subject matter disclosed by D1.

1.4 Consequently, the main request meets the requirements of Article 54 EPC.

2. Admissibility of the inventive step objection based on D1

2.1 Applicant 02 raised an inventive step objection in its appeal brief based on a problem-solution approach starting from D1 as the closest prior art, in combination with the teachings of documents D3 and D5. The respondent contested the admissibility of this objection.

It is undisputed that this objection regarding inventive step was not raised during the opposition phase and therefore constitutes a modification of the arguments put forward by applicant 02. The admission of such a modification is left to the discretion of the chamber. The chamber exercises its discretion taking into account in particular the complexity and relevance of the modification as well as the principle of procedural economy (Article 12(4) RPCR 2020).

This objection appears primarily irrelevant, given the choice of D1 as the closest prior art. D1 does not suggest separating the compounds into a first or second composition nor applying them in two steps as claimed in claim 1 of the contested patent, and its teaching therefore does not seem to allow considering this document as a prior art close to the claimed process. Furthermore, D1 does not mention the problem of the contested patent, namely wash resistance to shampooing. The choice of D1 as the closest prior art is therefore not realistic. A discussion on this basis would also be detrimental to the principle of procedural economy. For these reasons, the chamber decides not to admit this new objection into the appeal proceedings (Article 12(4) RPCR 2020).

Moreover, applicant 02 did not indicate in its appeal brief or during the oral proceedings the reasons why it did not raise this objection during the opposition phase and instead chose to defer the discussion to the appeal stage (Article 12(6) RPCR). The chamber notes in particular that during the oral proceedings before the opposition proceedings, applicant 2 only mentioned D3 and D5 as documents likely to represent the closest prior art without ever referring to D1. Claim 1 in question being still that of the patent as granted, the chamber sees no reason justifying the introduction of this new objection at the appeal stage only.

The objections combining D3 with D5 and starting from D1 raised by applicant 02 are therefore not admitted into the appeal proceedings under Articles 12(4) and 12(6) RPCR 2020.

3. Admissibility of the arguments combining D5 with D3 starting from D3

3.1 The respondent contested the admissibility of the inventive step objection presented by applicant 01 in its appeal brief concerning the combination of the teaching of D3 as the closest prior art with that of D5.

3.2 However, the chamber notes that this combination of D3 with D5 is cited in the decision of the opposition division in the context of the assessment of inventive step (see page 11, last paragraph). Consequently, the combination D3-D5 is part of the appeal proceedings under Article 12(2) RPCR 2020, and the chamber does not have discretionary power under Article 12(4) RPCR 2020 to exclude it from the proceedings.

4. Main request - Inventive step

4.1 The invention relates to a cosmetic treatment process for hair, consisting of sequentially applying a first cosmetic composition followed by a second composition distinct from the first. This process is presented as capable of providing conditioning and detangling properties that are not only satisfactory immediately after the first application but also persistent after washing, for example, remaining effective for at least three shampoos. The improved properties particularly concern softness, smoothness, volume, and a natural touch that does not weigh down the hair, while maintaining light and individualized hair (see paragraphs [0001], [0004], and [0007] of the patent).

4.2 Applicant 01 considers D3 to be the closest prior art, in agreement with the opposition division in its decision, while applicant 02 has also considered D5 as the closest prior art.

4.2.1 D3 relates to the use of a treatment composition for keratin fibers that improves shine, softness, and smoothness of hair. Furthermore, pre-treating the hair with a care and/or washing composition allowed for the observation that the styling effects conferred by the composition resist the application of shampoo or conditioner (see paragraphs [0016] and [0017]), which corresponds to the problem of the contested patent.

Example IV of D3 shows the treatment of hair by applying a first composition L'Oréal Professionnel Lumi Care containing 0.8% MA of cetyl trimethylammonium chloride, 1% of Quaternium 80, and 1.35% by weight of dipalmitoylethyl hydroxyethylammonium methosulfate. After thirty seconds of pause without rinsing, a composition A is applied to the hair. This composition A is the composition of example 1 of D3 and includes a mixture of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and lactic acid in water.

D3 does not disclose the presence of a non-silicone fatty substance and a silicone in composition (i) and the presence of a cationic surfactant and a cationic polymer in composition (ii).

4.2.2 Document D5 concerns a treatment process that imparts a particularly soft touch to the hair, increases shine, improves elasticity, flexibility, and hairstyle hold, particularly the hold of the hairstyle through a ""memory effect"" (cf. paragraph [0006]). D5 discloses in this context a hair treatment process comprising the application to the hair of a composition I comprising a conditioning agent of the quaternary ammonium type and/or long-chain amine, and a composition II comprising at least one film-forming polymer.

More specifically, example 2 on page 7 of D5 discloses a hair treatment process comprising the application to the hair of a composition I, containing a cationic surfactant and several non-silicone fatty substances, followed by the application of a composition II, containing among other things a cationic surfactant and Polyquaternium-16 as a cationic polymer. Composition I does not contain silicone, and composition II does not contain an organosilane, which is an essential element of the contested patent.

Example 3 of D5 discloses a double application of a first composition comprising cetearyl alcohol, dimethicone, and behentrimonium chloride, followed by the application of a composition comprising among other things an organopolysiloxane. The first composition does not contain a cationic surfactant, while the second composition does not include a cationic surfactant and a cationic polymer.

D5 does not address the issue of wash resistance in the effects conferred by the treatment, and the technical aim of D5 is completely different from that of the claimed process, namely the conditioning of hair and achieving a hairstyle through a composition comprising a fixing polymer. D5 particularly seeks to improve hairstyle hold with a memory effect, which makes it a document technically distant from the claimed invention. This document cannot therefore be considered as the closest prior art.

4.2.3 In view of the technical problem to be solved, document D3 indeed appears to be the closest document, as the opposition division had decided in its decision.

4.3 The technical problem in relation to D3 as defined by the opposition division in its decision is the provision of a hair treatment process that improves the wash resistance of the conditioning and detangling properties of organosilane-based care compositions. The respondent proposes the same definition of the problem.

Applicant 01 defines the problem as the provision of another hair treatment process, even partly a worse hair treatment. During the oral proceedings before the chamber, applicant 01 defined the problem as the provision of an alternative process.

Applicant 02 sees the problem as the provision of an alternative cosmetic hair treatment process.

4.4 The solution to these problems is in all cases the provision of a two-step process with, in particular, a composition (i) comprising a non-silicone fatty substance and a silicone and a composition (ii) comprising a cationic polymer having a cationic charge density of at least 4 meq/g.

4.5 Examples 4 and 5 of the patent, as well as tests D9, are mentioned in the context of defining the technical problem.

4.5.1 Example 4 of the patent does not present a comparison but mentions that the cosmetic performances obtained regarding detangling, smoothing, and touch persist after 4 shampoos; example 5 highlights the technical effect of a lack of rinsing between the two application steps of compositions (i) and (ii). The examples of the patent do not seem relevant to demonstrate the existence of an effect with respect to D3.

4.5.2 The experimental report D9 evaluates the persistence of the smooth touch obtained by applying several combinations of cosmetic compositions, namely a composition A comprising cationic surfactants, non-silicone fatty substances, and a silicone, combined with compositions B, C, or D, all applied after composition A and without rinsing, as defined in the following table:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPH

D9 thus particularly compares the results obtained by the following processes:

- a process P1 according to claim 1 of the contested patent (compositions A and B), with

- a comparative process P2 in which the second composition applied does not include a cationic polymer having a cationic charge density > 4 meq/g (compositions A and C); and with

- a comparative process P3 in which the second composition applied includes aminopropyltriethoxysilane and lactic acid, thus not including either a cationic polymer having a cationic charge density > 4 meq/g or a cationic surfactant (compositions A and D).

Process P3 corresponds to the process of example IV of D3 at least regarding the application of the second composition, since the first composition used in D9 is in all cases P1, P2, and P3, a composition according to the invention and therefore does not correspond to the first composition used in example IV of D3. Process P3 is therefore even more technically close to the claimed process than example IV of D3.

The results of these comparisons are summarized in the following table extracted from D9:

FORMULA/TABLE/GRAPH

The lower the forces required to slide the strand along its length, the smoother the hair. This comparative test thus shows that the smoothness of hair treated with the process P1 according to claim 1 of the opposed patent has better wash resistance compared to hair treated with the comparative processes P2 and P3, given a very low loss of smoothness after a shampoo (T1). These results show that the process according to the invention has an effect on the wash resistance of the conditioning properties of the hair.

Applicant 01 emphasizes in view of the tests D9 that the conditioning effect on the hair obtained by process P1 is worse than with process P2 and especially P3 (see table on page 4 of D9), which contradicts the aim of the claimed process, namely an improvement in conditioning properties immediately after the first application.

The chamber, however, is of the opinion that even if the results at time T0 are worse for process P1, this does not undermine the good wash resistance of the claimed process, which is explicitly proven in D9. The tests of D9 clearly show that the smoothing effect on touch is more durable as shown by the measured force at time T1, and thus that the effect withstands better against shampoos.

In view of these results, it appears evident that there is indeed an improvement in the wash resistance of the conditioning and detangling properties of organosilane-based care compositions and that the problem with respect to D3 should be defined as the respondent or the opposition division did in its decision.

4.6 It remains to determine whether the claimed solution is obvious.

4.6.1 D3 does not mention or suggest the addition of a cationic surfactant and a cationic polymer in the second composition, even less so for the purpose of improving the wash resistance of conditioning effects. To improve resistance to the application of a shampoo or conditioner, D3 proposes a pre-treatment by applying a composition comprising organic silicon compounds (see D3, paragraph [0017]). The solution envisaged by D3 is therefore different from that of the contested patent and appears distant from the claimed invention. The solution cannot therefore be considered obvious in view of D3.

4.6.2 The applicants mentioned document D5 regarding the obviousness of the solution, particularly examples 2 and 3 of D5, in which processes involving the successive application of compositions comprising some of the compounds claimed in the process and the compositions of the present invention are disclosed. Example 2 thus involves the application of a first composition comprising among other things a non-silicone fatty substance (cetyl alcohol) and a cationic surfactant, followed by the application of a second composition comprising among other things a cationic surfactant and a cationic polymer. Example 3 discloses the application of a first composition comprising among other things a non-silicone fatty substance (cetearyl alcohol), a cationic surfactant, and a silicone, followed by the application of a second composition comprising among other things an organosilane.

The chamber notes, however, that the subject matter of D5 is completely different from that of the contested patent, namely the conditioning of hair and achieving a hairstyle through a composition comprising a fixing polymer, and particularly seeks to improve hairstyle hold with a memory effect. D5 does not mention a possible wash resistance of conditioning effects. Thus, an association of its teaching with that of D3 does not appear realistic within the framework of defining the problem.

4.6.3 D4 was also mentioned by the applicants regarding the obviousness of the solution. Document D4 relates to single compositions comprising a cationic surfactant, a cationic polymer, a starch, and a non-silicone fatty substance. The aim of D4 is to provide compositions with very good cosmetic properties, particularly on very sensitized hair. This document does not disclose a second composition or the successive application of two compositions. Furthermore, D4 does not mention at any time the possible presence of one or more organosilanes.

4.6.4 In conclusion, neither documents D4 nor D5 address the issue of the resistance to shampoos of conditioning and detangling properties. Documents D6 and D7 were also discussed during the opposition phase, and the same conclusion applies to these documents. D6 indeed seeks to protect hair from heat, and D7 seeks to reduce frizz in certain types of hair. The claimed solution is therefore not obvious.

It follows that even if the problem had been defined as the provision of an alternative process allowing for the wash resistance of conditioning and detangling properties of organosilane-based care compositions, the conclusion would have been the same, as the disclosure of D3 and documents D4-D7 appears limited on this subject.
